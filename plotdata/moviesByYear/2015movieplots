Burke deduces that the flash drive contains the evidence and quickly heads to the precinct. Discovering the content of the flash drive, Shaw heads to Matthews' office. Burke receives word from Officer Meeks, one of his corrupt colleagues, that Shaw had already checked out the flash drive, but misses Shaw though both men shared the same elevator.

45 Years
 The film takes place across six days, marked by [[intertitle]]s. Five years after retirees Kate and Geoff Mercer had to cancel their 40th wedding anniversary because of his heart bypass surgery, the comfortably-off, childless [[Norfolk]] couple are preparing to celebrate their 45th anniversary with dozens of friends at the [[Assembly House]] in [[Norwich]]. A week before the anniversary party, they gently discuss the music that will be played. The first song from their wedding 45 years ago is their choice for the opening dance again — this is a song that Geoff has always liked. Their morning is somewhat disturbed when Geoff opens a letter from Switzerland telling him that the body of Katya, his German lover in the early 1960s, has become visible in a melting [[glacier]] where she fell into a [[crevasse]] on their hike with a guide over five decades ago. Memories rush back to him and he realizes he has forgotten much of what little German he used to know and that he would need a dictionary to fully understand all that the letter says.  Kate has been told about Katya previously by Geoff and seems initially unconcerned by his controlled disquiet. But gradually, Geoff's conduct begins to show that there is more on his mind than he says. Among other things, he tries to keep from Kate that he is beginning to take steps to fly to Switzerland without her to see Katya's body, which he imagines preserved in the now-transparent ice, still looking youthful. Prompted by Kate, Geoff talks about his relationship with Katya and thoughts evoked by the discovery of her body. He tells Kate that he and Katya had pretended to be married in order to be able to share a room in the more puritanical early 1960s. Because of this, the Swiss authorities consider him to be Katya's next of kin. Kate asks if they planned to be married and Geoff states confidently that they would have. While Kate is troubled by the revelation, she tells him: "I can hardly be cross about something that happened before we even existed... still..."  As the days pass and preparations for the party continue, Geoff continues to be moody and takes up smoking, which both had given up in the past. One night, Geoff climbs into the attic to look at his memorabilia of Katya and only reluctantly shows Kate a picture of Katya, when she angrily insists. Kate notices that in addition to their similar names, Katya appears to look much like Kate did when she was young, with the same dark hair.  Kate starts to ponder all of her life with Geoff and their possible [[Rebound (dating)|rebound]] relationship, and even begins "to smell Katya's perfume" in every room. While Geoff is out at a reunion luncheon at his former workplace, Kate climbs the ladder to the attic to seek what he might be keeping there. She finds Geoff's scrapbook filled with memorabilia from his time with Katya, including pressed violets from their last hike. She finds a [[carousel slide projector]], loaded with images of Switzerland and Katya, next to a makeshift screen to view them. Kate is shocked to see slides showing Katya with her hand on top of the curve of her abdomen: Katya was pregnant at the time of her death.   Kate also takes up smoking again and, upon learning of his visit to the local travel agency to inquire about trips to Switzerland, confronts Geoff about his recent behavior related to Katya, without revealing what she saw in the attic. She says that she now believes that many of their decisions as a couple, including their many [[German Shepherd]]s (and implicitly not having children), were influenced by Katya. Geoff promises that their marriage will "start again," which the next morning he marks by serving her tea in bed and making breakfast for her. They attend their anniversary party in the historic Grand Hall. Kate is constrained, distracted, and remains impassive during Geoff's speech in which he professes his love for Kate, while saying "the choices we make in our youth are most important". He brings himself to tears during the extremely personal and emotional speech, just as Kate's friend Lena has predicted men always do at weddings and anniversaries. Kate seems fleetingly heartened by the conclusion of his speech.  The first dance is announced, which is to be the same first song from their wedding, "[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]]" by [[The Platters]]. As Geoff and Kate slow dance, she becomes increasingly awkward and rigid, while he becomes silly and playful.

As the song ends, Geoff raises their hands together in the air as the party guests cheer, but Kate yanks her arm down. Geoff, apparently oblivious, dances away. The final close-up isolates Kate amid the mass of people on the dance floor as mixed emotions play across her face.

As he was getting away with the valuable chest, he runs into an elephant pit, accidentally throwing the chest outside. When Soman came back to his senses, he discovers that Pinky had eaten away the Neelakkoduveli from the popped open chest. The power of the exotic herb might have rendered Pinky auspicious, which might be the reason why the ewe lamb didn't get harmed.  Pappan finally manages to sell off Pinky to a butcher. On the sight of his friends' evoked grievances while the goat was being dragged away he feels a stroke of sympathy. As he calls the goat, he meets a girl with the same name ([[Swathi Reddy]]).

Smith and Keith arrive in town and decide to follow a scruffy man, Og (Sean Reynard) who masturbates in an underpass using a mouse. Smith and Keith rough him up and scare him. Og returns to his 'alpha', Ryan ([[Julian Rhind-Tutt]]) to tell him about these new threatening males, but Ryan gives him a beating and forces him to set up the new widescreen television.

We see a Flashback of a previous time when Jupiter was the alpha male of the house. He serves a Sunday Roast human leg to Barabara, Denise and Og. But Og disrupts the happy scene by confronting him aggressively, an act that Jupiter fails to deal with properly. The washing machine breaks down and Barabara rounds on Jupiter also.   Back in the dinner room, the family eats pudding. Ryan initiates a food fight and covers Barabara with blancmange. Barabara retaliates and they have a huge fight.

He and Og head out on the warpath and clash with Smith and Keith on some waste ground. Keith is stabbed by Og before Smith chases Og, smashing his head on the ground and killing him. Smith then rips Ryan's arm off and leaves him for dead.   Smith and Denise return to the house. Smith smashes up the kitchen in a display to convince Barabara of his new alpha status, but she is unconvinced. He tries to have sex with her but can not get it up and Barabara laughs at him. Smith collects Keith's body and gives him a 'funeral' before placing his corpse in the wheelie bin. Barabara is also unimpressed by this.   Smith invites Jupiter into the house and tries to involve him in the new 'family' group, but Jupiter only manages to wet his pants before sitting alone repeatedly watching an inane children's TV show involving an animated chicken. Smith repairs the house and gradually begins to win Barabara over. They all sit down to watch a sitcom starring two big comedy stars ([[Tony Way]] and [[Alice Lowe]]) which features slo-mo action replays of lame pratfalls.

 Julia Streak ([[Louisa Krause]]) is a troubled, [[antipsychotic]]-dependent young woman who takes a job as a night guard at a grand but abandoned apartment complex so she can support her daughter, Clara. She is accepted by master keeper Dixon Boothe (Ezra Knight) and introduced to the only other security guard for the complex, the rude [[paraplegic]] Dennis Cooper ([[Jason Patric]]), who has been working at the complex since it opened. While patrolling, Julia hears whispers from Room 441, whose access is blocked by a locked door. Cooper denies that there is anything unusual behind the door, claiming that the owners left the room unfinished.  Sometime later, a homeless man, Jim ([[Mark Margolis]]) attempts to enter the complex. Cooper refuses him access, but Julia allows him shelter under the condition that he does not wander. Using a hammer from Jim's belongings, Julia breaks the lock and discovers that Room 441 is a corridor leading to a dormitory. Meanwhile, Jim wanders anyway and follows Julia into the dormitory. There, Julia encounters a number of deformed children. She calls for Cooper's aid, but the two end up losing track of Jim. Jim, now at the dormitory, is then killed by a blonde girl, who smashes his head with a faucet.   Julia searches through the internet and finds a video of the Wellville, a center for deformed and mentally-challenged children, which had been accused of abusing its patients. Julia connects the center with the dormitory but Cooper, having found out that she is dependent on anti-psychotics, handcuffs her while he heads to Room 441 alone. However, his wheelchair breaks and he is sent to the dormitory, where he is haunted by the deformed children.   Following Cooper, Julia meets an apple-cheeked boy (Henry Kelemen), who gives her more details about Wellville: the children, four in total, attempted to escape, but they were caught and forced inside a room containing a reservoir of unhealthy water. By the time that the Wellville's crimes were revealed, all but one had died. Thinking that the survivor struggling to get out of the reservoir is Clara (Morgan Waulters), Julia jumps inside, despite Cooper's warning. She is saved by Cooper from drowning at the cost of his life. Finding the door locked, Julia asks for mercy and is confronted by the children, including the face-deformed blonde girl. She convinces the girl to forgive her, after which the children allow her to leave.  It is revealed that all the events were happening inside Julia's mind. Julia is in fact the deformed girl, being the daughter of "Dennis Cooper", whom she gave a new identity in her dream. Dixon is the doctor assigned to her, Jim a sickly old man being treated next to her, while Clara is the name of her doll. The film ends with Julia [[Flatline|flatlining]] after being on life support since she was a child, next to her grieving father.

Absolutely Anything
 Decades after being launched into space, a space probe containing information about the human race and a map to Earth is found by four aliens that make up the "galactic council". They debate on whether to destroy the earth or make humanity a member of the council, instead relying on "standard galactic protocol" to decide. They will give one human (chosen at random) the ability to do absolutely anything he or she wants. After ten days, if the powers have been used for good, the Aliens will spare earth and make humanity a member of the council. If the powers are used for evil, Earth will be destroyed for the moral improvement of the galaxy.  The human is chosen and revealed to be Neil Clarke ([[Simon Pegg]]) a secondary school teacher who is both struggling at his job, due to the Headmaster, Mr. Robinson ([[Eddie Izzard]]); and with his lack of a girlfriend, although he has a crush on author agency employee, Catherine West ([[Kate Beckinsale]]), who lives underneath him in the [[apartment]] block. At first, oblivious to the powers he has, Neil accidentally causes an alien spaceship to destroy a classroom within the school, killing the entire class in the process. The galactic council scolds the alien that blew up the classroom, who responds by saying that out of the millions of species the council has evaluated, none have ever passed and all have been destroyed.  Perplexed and anxious, Neil goes home and slowly realises he can do anything after causing his dog, Dennis's waste to clean itself up, and causing spilt whisky to flow out of the drain and back into the bottle. He asks that "everyone who died come back to life" and unknowingly causes everyone who has ever died ever to be resurrected, resulting in a [[zombie apocalypse]], he reverses this and asks that the explosion never happened, sending himself back in time to the previous day. He then confirms his suspicions by causing the PE teacher Miss Pringle ([[Emma Pierson]]) to worship his friend, Ray ([[Sanjeev Bhaskar]]) whereas before, she was repulsed by him.  Over the coming days, Neil uses his power for personal gain by giving himself a more muscular body, increasing his penis size, making Mr. Robinson be nice to him and giving Dennis the ability to speak (voice of [[Robin Williams]]). One night, the galactic power the aliens possess fails momentarily, meaning Neil cannot do anything. This happens just as Neil asks that Catherine be madly in love with him, and coincidentally a drunk Catherine knocks at his door at that moment, after being encouraged to sleep with Neil by a friend. They spend the night together as a result and are seen by Colonel Grant ([[Rob Riggle]]), an American soldier who has been stalking Catherine.  The next day, Catherine goes to Neil's apartment to speak to him, where Dennis shouts from the kitchen that he loves Neil and he should "Shag the Bitch!". Disgusted and now thinking that Neil is [[Homosexuality|gay]], Catherine storms out with Neil chasing after her. Ray appears and states that Miss Pringle doesn't worship him romantically, she actually thinks he is a god and has formed a religion based on him. That night, Catherine returns home to find Colonel Grant waiting in her apartment for her, and she locks him in. Neil appears and offers to cook dinner for her, which she accepts. Grant crashes the meal and Catherine storms out due to the two fighting, Neil incapacitates Grant by breaking then fixing his arm and then convinces Grant that he has powers. Grant knocks Neil unconscious and kidnaps him and Dennis, when Neil wakes up, Grant forces him to grant a list of selfish and pointless wishes, threatening to shoot Dennis if Neil refuses.  Catherine and Ray track Neil down to the apartment Grant is renting and rescue Neil, but not before Neil makes Catherine fall madly in love with Grant. When free, Neil reverses all of the wishes he granted Grant and also stops Miss Pringle from worshipping Ray. Upon getting home, Catherine angrily tells Neil that she could never love anyone who could make her do whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted to do it. Disheartened, Neil decides to use his powers to solve the world's problems; he gives everyone in the world as much food as they want, he gives everyone in the world their own dream house, and removes any reason for anyone to go to war.  However, this soon backfires when worldwide obesity rates rise, every piece of uninhabited land in the world is developed on, and several countries declare war on each other for no reason at all. Disillusioned, Neil goes to [[Hammersmith Bridge]] with the intention of committing suicide, but as he jumps into the [[River Thames]], Dennis jumps in after him and Neil is forced to swim them both out of the river. Sitting on a bench on [[Hampstead Heath]] overlooking [[London]], Dennis says that Neil should give the power to him, as he never thinks of anything selfish and he loves taking orders, which Neil happily does.  Meanwhile, the aliens finish their evaluation and decide that Earth is not worthy, revealing that they view greedy and evil acts as strong and thoughtful acts as weak. They therefore decide to destroy the planet, but just before they can, Dennis asks that the source of the power be destroyed, causing a laser beam shooting towards Earth to bounce back to the alien's ship, killing them all and destroying the galactic power. Full of confidence and excitement for not having the powers any more, Neil asks Catherine out, which she agrees to.

Childhood friends from suburban [[Nalasopara]], [[Mumbai]], they form a team and participate in a national level competition ''Hum Kisi Se Kum Nahin'' where they are disqualified from the grand finale as their moves are revealed to be copied from the performance act of the ''[[Philippine All Stars]]'' and the judges term them cheaters. Everyone departs to search for jobs. Suru returns to work in a bar as a waiter, Vinnie rejoins a beauty parlour and Vernon ('''Sushant Pujari''') gets back as a delivery boy where, on and off, they are insulted as cheaters. The departure of angry teammates adds insult to injury, and nothing is set to be corrected.  Suru hopes to remove the negative tag by planning to win a grander hip-hop competition in [[Las Vegas]]. One day he watches Vishnu ([[Prabhudeva]]), a rogue visitor,  prove his dance mettle to a betting visitor in the bar and convinces him repeatedly to be their choreographer. They audition for people and formulate the team. They visit the qualifiers in Bangalore, where they are pre-insulted as cheaters, but manage to win it after Vishnu begs the audience for one last chance for the team. Although things are fine, Suru is broken when Shetty Anna ([[Murli Sharma]]), the owner of the bar where he is employed, refuses to provide him financial support extending to Rs. 25 lakhs, something he had earlier publicly promised to Suru at the time of the ''Hum Kisi Se Kum Nahin'' finale, and Suru leaves the place, angry at Anna's insulting language for Vinnie. However, Vishnu manages to get the money from Crocxz's ([[Raghav Juyal]]) uncle who he convinces, after Suru loses hope when Vishnu gets angry at his inability to arrange team funds. Later they prepare to go to Las Vegas, but Vinod ([[Punit Pathak]]), a deaf-mute dancer, learns from Vishnu himself that the latter has ulterior motives to go to Vegas, and, as a matter of fact, he had deliberately impressed Suru and friends to procure a way out for his plan. In Las Vegas they win the qualifiers. Later Vishnu leaves the hotel with team money to meet his son Manu (Jineet Rath), whose mother, Swati ([[Tisca Chopra]]) is married to another man and has moved on in life. He talks to Manu and leaves with a contented heart.  In the meantime, Vinnie gets injured due to excessive rehearsal and is replaced by Olive ([[Lauren Gottlieb]]), an American girl of partial Indian origin, and Vishnu discovers this while thanking friend Gopi ([[Ganesh Acharya]]), who works in a bar-cum-hotel. At the same time, Suru is enraged when he finds Vishnu missing and tries to proceed with jam sessions all on his own, but in vain. Vishnu returns while trying to save the day for Suru from the German team as they get into a fight, later admitting he had made a 'mistake' leaving without permission although he didn't want to lose a family he had yearned to create in years, apologizes, is forgiven by Suru, and the team enters the finals. Across rehearsals, Olive gets close to Suru and a jealous Vinnie tells Suru she loves him. Although Olive has feelings for Suru, an in-person conversation with Vinnie assures Olive that Suru had that inherent charm with nothing to do about his sweetness, and she agrees to continue with the Indian Stunners after Vinnie recovers. The team enters the final, where Vinod's health worsens during a fictitious assemblage and the ''Indian Stunners'' end up making this grave mistake in the formation only to fall down, since D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) knew about Vinod's tuberculosis problem. Everyone has almost given up after the accident, when Vinod tries to encourage Suru, who forgoes the accident and the others return to make the formation with success with Vinod at the bottom. They don't win the competition but win the hearts of millions, with Suru lending a voiceover narrative about his mother's motivational lessons on dance.

When she is abruptly fired from her job, Gwen's optimism quickly dissolves as she realizes the only offer she has for employment is as an egg donor, as women are rapidly becoming infertile. The firing comes at a critical juncture in Gwen's life because she needs money to ensure Jules's position at an elite school.    Desperate, Gwen reaches out to her old employers, asking Fisher to use her as one of the first subjects to transfer her consciousness into a new body, allowing her to keep her old job by becoming more youthful and racially ambiguous. Fisher assures her that if she agrees to the body transfer the Center will do everything they can to ensure Jules's future and protect Gwen as the face of the company. He also warns her the procedure is in its infancy; for a year, Gwen will have to take shots to help her breathe every two hours and will face enduring pain. He explains the technology is not finished yet and begs her to reconsider.  Before agreeing to the procedure, Gwen tries one last desperate measure. She reaches out to her cousin Lily and Lily's husband Han for help. Gwen and Han had an affair years ago, and, though Lily is forgiving of the affair, her attitude changes once she learns Gwen has a child fathered by Han.

Jules, warned that her mother might be slightly different, takes care of her and administers her shots when she has difficulty breathing. However, Gwen 2.0 has trouble understanding and relating to Jules after the procedure. She tells Fisher she wants to separate from Jules, thinking Jules can take care of herself and she needs the time alone. Fisher is furious and reveals to Gwen 2.0 that she is not actually Gwen, but a twin that was implanted with Gwen's memories; he explains the twin process to her because he thinks it will be easier for the twin Gwen to merge with the donor's memories if she does not know.

She then goes to work and opens a box of film reels, including one that explains her life. She was born on New Years Day 1908, then later married and gave birth to a daughter, only to become a widow after her husband died in a tragic accident. Years later, in 1937, Adaline crashed her car when she swerved into a ravine during a snowstorm and died in the freezing lake nearby, but a lightning strike suddenly revived her. From that moment on, Adaline has stayed physically 29 years old.  One night, two suspicious FBI agents attempt to force her onto an airplane for study, but she escapes captivity and realizes that she will have to spend the rest of her life on the run. Ever since, she has changed her identification and address according to the era, while her daughter Flemming ages normally, to the point where she appears older than Adaline.  On [[New Year's Eve]] in the present year, she attends a party where she meets Ellis Jones, introducing herself as her current alias, Jennifer. He asks to see her again but she refuses, knowing she can never fall in love because she can never have a normal future with someone. The next day at work, Ellis arrives and again asks Adaline to go on a date with him. Finally she accepts.  In a flashback, Adaline is shown pulling up in a cab to a park where a man is waiting, holding an engagement ring. Scared, she asks the cab driver to keep going. Back in the present day, Adaline's dog falls ill and she begins to ignore Ellis' calls. He shows up at her apartment but she pushes him away, only to have a change of heart while looking through some old photographs and realizing she doesn't want to live the same year a hundred times without having a natural life.  They later resolve their argument and Ellis asks Adaline to attend the party at his parents' house celebrating his parents' fortieth anniversary, and she says yes. Upon their arrival, Ellis introduces her to his father, William, who recognizes her instantly and calls her Adaline. She appears to recognize him, too, but lies, telling him that Adaline was her mother, who has since died. A flashback shows how they met and came to be in love, soon revealing that he was the man with the engagement ring she stood up that afternoon. One night, Ellis tells Adaline he is falling in love with her and she is unsure of how to react.  The following day, Adaline talks with William outside and he notices a scar on her left hand, and becomes shaken. Another flashback reveals that Adaline cut her hand while they were hiking decades ago and he had stitched it up himself. He realizes that she is truly Adaline and confronts her. She becomes upset, claiming she used to be "normal" and doesn't know what changed her. He begs her not to run, for Ellis' sake, but she says she doesn't know how to stay. She flees and returns to the house, writing a note to Ellis while he showers, then she packs her things and leaves. Moments later, Ellis finds the letter and confronts his father, who refuses to explain.  While driving home, Adaline thinks of all the times she has run and suddenly has a change of heart about the way she lives her life. She stops and calls her daughter to tell her she is going to stop running. As she turns the car around, a tow truck plows into her in a hit-and-run accident, leaving her to die. Freezing and helpless, Adaline dies again. An ambulance arrives and she is revived by the electricity of the defibrillator. Later in the hospital, she wakes up to Ellis, and the two profess their love for one another. Adaline then tells him of her 107 years of life.  One year later, Ellis and Adaline are going to a New Year's Eve party. As she is leaving, she notices something strange in the hallway mirror: her first grey hair, proving she has begun to age naturally again. When Ellis asks if she is okay, she responds: "Yes... Perfect."

Suddenly quiet and shy Onie appears out of no-where, suggesting she may be teetering between life and death. Clues are provided by the cabin itself, the different rooms, and two paintings inside the cabin.   Whilst the five get to know each other tensions flare as they try and work out why they are all there. A nearby [[lighthouse]] causes them all to have terrifying [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] accompanied by deafening sounds. Any attempt to walk away from the cabin towards the lighthouse is met by them somehow ending back up at the hut.   Despite Onie trying to [[self-harm]], and the girls trying to kill Seb, it appears they can no longer 'die' again as they are already dead. A supernatural being of unknown power, manifesting as black smoke, takes over the bodies of Seb and Robyn at various points.   As time passes the 'bubble' they are trapped in slowly grows smaller around the cabin, which contains different rooms from each of the occupants lives. It is determined that the house is a single occurrence of a cosmic test which everyone must undergo upon death (each group of deceased people encountering a unique house but the same test), with the solution being not to sin again having reached the tabula rasa (“blank slate”) house.  It is also determined that no one has ever passed the test, that everyone outside the bubble is in Hell, and that Heaven is empty because of this.  Onie reappears and disappears for one last time having decided to live, leaving a blanket to control the smoke monster. Livvy uses the blanket to make Robyn possessed, revealing that she figured out Robyn's sin (she was the night club manager who let too many people in and caused the collapse) and convincing her to use the demon power to take Livvy to Heaven (hoping it will cause a destruction of all afterlife, harking back to a saying Patricia’s father had said about Heaven being destroyed if a sinner were to enter). Upon destruction of the afterlife, Hell would theoretically also be destroyed, freeing every soul who ever died from it.  At the end the bubble closes on itself and the film ends abruptly, with the result of Livvy’s plan left ambiguous.

Air (2015 film)
 A chemical weapons catastrophe has wiped out most of mankind and rendered the air un-breathable. The US government hastily built a few makeshift underground bunkers in which a few scientists are kept in cryogenic sleep until the air is no longer toxic. Each of those bunkers is kept up by a couple of maintenance workers who are awoken for two hours every six months in order to perform routine tasks and inspections to keep the facility going.  The story begins with two workers of one of such facility, Cartwright ([[Djimon Hounsou|Hounsou]]) and Bauer ([[Norman Reedus|Reedus]]). They go about their normal list of tasks during one wake cycle. Cartwright has occasional visions of his wife Abby ([[Sandrine Holt|Holt]]) and has conversations with her, to Bauer's annoyance.  Just as the two hours are almost over, Cartwright's sleeping chamber is destroyed by a fire that was caused by recent seismic activity. The two frantically locate the valve for the emergency air supply, and then try to find a spare chamber for Cartwright to sleep in.  The chamber is operational, and Bauer chooses to use it. However, the chamber malfunctions and almost suffocates Bauer until Cartwright finally appears and cuts him free, destroying the chamber in the process.  With no other spare chamber in the facility, Bauer insists that they eject a random sleeping person to allow Cartwright to occupy that chamber. Cartwright refuses to send anyone to their death and insists there is another way. He exits the facility in a hazmat suit in an attempt to enter a nearby sister facility, with Bauer on the radio helping him navigate. Cartwright encounters several corpses as he makes his way through air ducts.  When he finally enters the facility, he realizes that everybody in it is dead, clearly for a long time already. Although the computer system has reported all facility workers to be alive and well during all the previous wake cycles, it is apparent that this was a ruse to make the workers believe they're not alone in order for them to stay sane.  At the same time, Bauer reviews the security footage and realizes that Cartwright was standing next to him the entire time while he almost suffocated in the spare chamber, indicating that Cartwright had tried to kill him and only decided against it in the last minute.  As Cartwright returns to their own facility, Bauer confronts him with a gun. A chase through the facility ensues, with Cartwright finally getting the upper hand by sneaking up on Bauer and injecting a large dose of morphine into him. Bauer accepts his fate, and makes peace with Cartwright before passing out.  In an epilogue, Cartwright wakes up for another cycle, appearing to have aged many decades. The air is breathable again, and the facility's system is automatically waking up all the sleepers who exit their chambers and walk up to the Earth's surface, among them Abby.

Aloha (film)
 Military contractor Brian Gilcrest ([[Bradley Cooper]]) returns to Hawaii to organize a traditional blessing for a new pedestrian gate on behalf of billionaire Carson Welch ([[Bill Murray]]), who intends to develop nearby land into a space center. Following a celebrated military career that ended in shadowy deals in Afghanistan, the now disillusioned Gilcrest is tasked with negotiating a deal with the Hawaiian natives and supporting Carson's launch of a privately-funded satellite. Gilcrest's mission is complicated by his former girlfriend Tracy ([[Rachel McAdams]]), now married with two children, and his idealistic Air Force liaison, Captain Allison Ng ([[Emma Stone]]), whose wide-eyed fascination with space reminds him of his own childhood sense of wonder.  Gilcrest and Ng travel to meet King Kanahele at his isolated community to negotiate a deal for his participation in the gate blessing ceremony. Along the way, Ng tries to engage Gilcrest in conversation about his life and work but is unable to break through his cynicism. When they meet the king, Ng, who is part Hawaiian, bonds with him and his companions, identifying with their spiritual view of the land and sky. After prolonged negotiations, Gilcrest brokers a deal for the king's participation in exchange for two mountains and free cell phone service. The next night, Gilcrest and Ng have dinner at Tracy's house, where they meet her husband Woody ([[John Krasinski]]) and their two children, Grace and Mitch. At one point, Gilcrest and Tracy find themselves alone in the kitchen, where she admits that she loved him and had plans to  make a life with him before he abandoned her thirteen years ago.  The next evening, they attend Carson's Christmas party, where General Dixon ([[Alec Baldwin]]) tells Gilcrest not to screw up their deal with the Hawaiians. One of the general's men hands Gilcrest a thumb drive containing top secret information for the upcoming satellite launch. During the party, Gilcrest becomes attracted to Ng, who is having fun dancing with Carson. Afterwards, Ng joins Gilcrest in his room while he recounts his experiences in Kabul, where he almost died. He tells her that this was the first night he was truly happy to be living, and the two have sex. The next day, Ng discovers that Carson's satellite will actually carry a nuclear payload. When she tries to resign, her colonel tells her it is a private operation run by Carson and that Gilcrest is aware of the details. Later she confronts Gilcrest in tears for lying to her and the Hawaiians.  Meanwhile, Woody and Tracy confront each other about recent tensions in their marriage, which he believes were caused by Gilcrest's arrival. They agree to separate. The next morning, Tracy shows up at Gilcrest's hotel and reveals that Grace is his daughter. Later that day, after the successful blessing of the new pedestrian gate, Gilcrest learns that the Chinese are attempting to hack the satellite's code to prevent the impending launch. He rushes to the command center and undermines the hackers' efforts. As he watches the satellite enter geosynchronous orbit, he realizes what he's done and its impact on Ng, whom he has come to love. Quickly, he orders a massive sonic upload to be sent to space, and he and Ng hold hands as they watch the satellite explode. Believing Ng's continued association with him will ruin her promising career, he tells her they should not see each other again.  Carson is not pleased with the destruction of his satellite and confronts Gilcrest, who tells him he cannot "buy the sky". General Dixon is also incensed by Gilcrest's actions, threatening to prosecute him.  Gilcrest returns to Tracy's house, where she reads him a moving love letter from Woody. Gilcrest tells her she belongs with her husband and she encourages him to go after Ng. Woody comes home and sees Gilcrest in his house. Woody tells Gilcrest he knows Gilcrest is Grace's father. He asks Gilcrest if he slept with Tracy while he was gone. Gilcrest tells Woody he slept with Ng and not with his wife. Woody goes into the living room where Tracy is cleaning up. She sees Woody and they both run into each other's arms, then are joined by Grace and Mitch. Gilcrest leaves the house while the happy family reunion continues.  General Dixon soon learns that Gilcrest was telling the truth about the nuclear weapons payload and praises him for what he's done, revealing that authorities will soon be taking Carson into custody. Outside the hotel, Gilcrest finds Ng, who is preparing to leave. He tells her he loves her, is staying in Hawaii and will be waiting for her to return. Later that night, Gilcrest stands outside Grace's hula class and watches her dance. She notices him, he nods at her and she suddenly realizes he is her father. With tears of joy in her eyes, she runs outside and embraces him then returns to her class to continue her hula dancing.  
Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival
 Lucifer conducts a train full of condemned souls, including Ms. Merrywood, back up to Heaven. As the train approaches Heaven’s gates, Ms. Merrywood discovers a horseshoe pendant and the condemned souls begin singing hymns (‘’Shovel and Bone’’). In Heaven, God discusses the crisis with his top dog, The Agent. The Agent and The Translators, officers in Heaven’s police force, interrogate Merrywood about her presence and the pendant. In Hell, the Ticket-Keeper warns Lucifer that the carnies are not prepared for a war with Heaven, but Lucifer dismisses him to entertain a cloaked figure. Lucifer opens his book of Aesop’s Fables and reads “The Filly and The Lapdog” to the cloaked person.  In flashback, a new crop of Applicants arrive in Heaven, including best friends June and Cora. They are welcomed into Heaven and are offered a tour of the premises (‘’All Aboard (Everybody’s Doing The Ark’’).  June defies The Librarian about banned books in Heaven and steals a Number 1 armband from The Designer, who keeps the Number 7s working in a windowless design shop, that starkly contrasts with the grandeur of the Heaven lobby (‘’Only By Design’’). June’s rebellious nature makes her and the reserved Cora wander around Heaven, only to be arrested and interrogated by The Translators (‘’Good Little Dictation Machines’’). The Agent intervenes, and there is a mutual attraction between him and June, which gets him negative press from The Watchword. When God becomes aware of this, he orders The Agent to seduce June to expose her heresy.  The Agent brings June to a bar, Club Cloud Seven, where his closeness with God leads him to be invited to sing (‘’Down at the Midnight Rectory’’). God arrives and serenades one of his girlfriends (‘’Cloud Serenade’’). The Agent and June’s relationship continues, always under the watchful eye of The Watchword (‘’The Watchword’s Hour’’). The Watchword confronts Cora, warning her that her lesbian attraction to June is forbidden and illegal in Heaven. The Agent gives June the horseshoe pendant Merrywood will find, telling her the story of [[Dunstan]], which reignites her curiosity with banned material and she runs off to steal a restricted book. Confident that The Agent’s clout will protect her, she steals a book, setting off an alarm. June is beaten by The Translators and tossed down an elevator shaft leading to Hell.  Meanwhile, The Librarian instructs Cora and the other Applicants to denounce June, and spend the rest of the night restoring order by re-shelving Heaven's library with him (‘’Hitting on All Sevens’’). The Librarian tells Cora she will go far in Heaven.  June arrives at a weaker, smaller Carnival, with a younger Lucifer and Ticket-Keeper.  She flees from The Fool and finds The Twin and asks him for a drink. The Twin obliges as long as she play a shell game for her pendant. As the game goes on, The Twin shapeshifts into Cora, The Agent, and finally, June herself (‘’Fair Game’’). Upon losing, June wanders into the midway and finds Lucifer, who becomes inspired by her to turn the Carnival into something that can challenge Heaven. He helps her transform into The Painted Doll ("After the Fall").  In the present, Ticket-Keeper rebuffs several plans to attack Heaven from the carnies. The cloaked figure is revealed to be Painted Doll, who will play a role in Lucifer’s war with Heaven. Ticket-Keeper confronts Lucifer about his worries with the Carnival, offering to sacrifice himself for the cause. Lucifer refuses Ticket-Keepers martyrdom and shows him his plans for the war.  Meanwhile, in Heaven, God dispatches The Agent to face Lucifer and quell the uprising in Hell, giving him a book containing the story “The Filly and the Lapdog”. God puts on a presentation for the denizens of Heaven, mocking Lucifer in a parable drawn from the Dust Bowl and Aesop’s Fable “The Swallow and the Other Birds” (‘’Bells of the Black Sunday’’).  The Agent arrives in Hell and finds Painted Doll. She leads him on to give the carnies time to capture and poison him. Lucifer prepares for battle by applying war makeup as God sends armed reinforcements down to Hell. In Heaven, Ms. Merrywood is revealed to be The Twin, now posing as The Agent returning from his mission (‘’Hoof and Lap/The Devil’s Carnival’’). In a post-credits sequence, The Twin as The Agent serenades God (‘’Songs of Old’’).

Charlie refuses to let him touch a camera, and Milo then tells him to grab the camera and look around. Through the camera, Charlie sees the closet door flying open, and The Operator rushing him. Charlie panics and drops the camera, and all three take off from the house.  Later, they turn the camera on to find an Operator Symbol inside Milo's car. The three go on the run, trying to escape the Operator and find out what happened to Dan and his family. Eventually, Charlie's informant tells him that Dan used his money to purchase a home in a new location. However, they discover that the house has been burnt down. They locate a [[storm shelter]] with a working camera feed which caught everything going on in the house. The feed reveals that Dan [[smothered]] his daughter Tara (Morgan Bastin) before being killed himself by his wife Rose ([[Alexandra Holden]]), who then [[arson | burned the house down]].  They then go to the local sheriff (George Back), who informs them that Rose survived the fire, and that she is locked up in an [[Psychiatric hospital | asylum]]. The three manage to contact Rose, who proceeds to calmly inform them that she believes the monster came into their life because Dan became interested in it. However, when she sees the Operator Symbol on Sara's arm, she attacks her. Sara, Milo and Charlie are forced to leave while medical staff restrain Rose.  Completely out of options, they decide to make a [[last stand]] in a cabin. After setting the whole place up with cameras, Milo notices that the camera picked up a detail he missed at the hospital: Rose's mark was gone. The crew are then attacked by The Operator. Milo hangs himself, believing that if he dies, Charlie and Sara will be safe. The Operator seemingly leaves after Milo dies, but Milo's dead body suddenly rises from the ground as a zombie. It grabs a pipe and beats Charlie to death before catching and killing Sara. Milo then falls to the floor, his eyes a solid white. Moments later, The Operator appears, and his movements seemingly loop. He then vanishes, and Milo's eyes return to normal.  The movie ends with Dan and Rose leaving a sale, where Dan has purchased a camera with a "college project tape" inside, presumably a tape from the student film-within-a-film of the original Marble Hornets [[webseries]].

American Ultra
 Mike Howell is a [[Drug culture|stoner]] who lives in the sleepy town of Liman, West Virginia, where he works as a convenience store clerk. He is planning to propose to his longtime girlfriend, Phoebe Larson, on a trip to Hawaii. However, due to a fear of travel, he suffers intense panic attacks and is unable to board the plane. It is revealed he has had similar issues trying to leave town in the past and does not understand why Phoebe is so nice about it.  In Langley, Virginia, CIA Agent Victoria Lasseter receives a coded warning that Mike, the sole survivor of her “Wiseman” [[Project MKUltra|Ultra program]], is to be eliminated by her rival, Adrian Yates, and his similar “Toughguy” agents. Feeling a duty to protect Mike, Lasseter travels to Liman and "activates" Mike through a series of code words. Mike fails to understand their significance, and she leaves in resigned frustration.  Mike finds two Toughguys planting a bomb in his car and is attacked, but his training activates and he quickly kills them. Horrified, he calls Phoebe, who reaches him just as Sheriff Watts arrives. Yates sends two Toughguy operatives, Laugher and Crane, to kill Mike and Phoebe at the sheriff station, but they evade Laugher and kill Crane before escaping to the home of Mike's drug dealing friend Rose. Mike becomes unnerved by an array of facts he suddenly knows regarding military strategy. He also realises he has very little memory prior to living in the town with Phoebe, wondering aloud why he never questioned this before.  Yates places the city under quarantine, and puts Lasseter and Mike's pictures on the local news. Lasseter contacts her former assistant, Petey Douglas, to air drop her a weapon. Yates finds out and threatens Petey with charges of treason, causing Peter to deny her further help. Yates then attacks Rose's house with two Toughguys using a lethal gas. The agents kill Rose and his two guards, Big Harold and Wuinzin, before Mike and Phoebe kill the attackers and she rescues Mike from the gas, which she is familiar with. When pressed for answers on her knowledge of the gas, Phoebe reluctantly reveals she was a CIA agent assigned to be Mike's handler, leaving him heartbroken.  Laugher ambushes the duo and captures Phoebe. Mike is rescued by Lasseter and insists on returning to his house. She tells him that he volunteered for Wiseman due to his criminal record and subsequently had his memories erased. He also learns that Phoebe was to get him settled in Liman and then leave, but chose to stay because she legitimately fell in love. Lasseter also explains that his phobias, including his fear of leaving town, were implanted to keep him safe.  Yates’ army liaison, Otis, joins a  Toughguy to attack Mike’s house. Mike and Lasseter kill them, prompting Yates to order a drone strike on the entire block. Petey launches the drone but eventually refuses to fire its missile, then secretly reports the situation to Yates' superior, Raymond Krueger.  Mike contacts Yates and arranges to exchange himself for Phoebe at a local grocery store. He attacks the store, killing or incapacitating multiple Toughguys before fighting and defeating Laugher, who he spares when Mike learns he is a mentally unbalanced man forcibly conscripted by Yates. Phoebe escapes from Yates when Lasseter attacks him, but Krueger arrives and stops her.  Phoebe and Mike leave the store under gunpoint of multiple law enforcement officers, before whom he proposes to her.  In a forested area, Krueger has Yates and Lasseter bound and kneeling. Yates argues that what he was doing would have been okay with Krueger, despite the deaths of seven innocent sheriffs, if the results had been successful, and Krueger agrees. Yates, missing the “successful” codicil, smugly smiles and stands, but is executed by Krueger. Krueger admits he informed Lasseter of Yates’ plan, and she points out that, by taking out 17 Toughguys, Mike is proof of the success of her Wiseman program.  Six months later, handled by Lasseter and Petey, Mike and Phoebe are in Manila, confident and happy together as they carry out a CIA assignment.

She realizes quickly that it will be a challenge to work for her uncle, while at the same time, she struggles to warm to her cousin Sylvie, who also works at the ''pâtisserie'' but is uncomfortable with the extra company. As Grace's efforts at the ''pâtisserie'' get her into trouble, her mother advises her to ask Bernard what he needs help with, rather than do things herself.

Bastille Day becomes a success for the ''pâtisserie'', despite worries from both Grace and her uncle. As Grace's trip in Paris comes to an end, Bernard tells her that she will keep learning the ''je ne sais quoi'', as it differs for every recipe.

As a side effect of the drug, his employees hallucinate.

Angry Indian Goddesses
 Freida ([[Sarah-Jane Dias]]) is a fashion photographer who invites a group of friends to her family's home to announce that she is getting married.

The announcement sets off a chain of reactions, letting out hidden secrets. After the announcement, the wild bunch of girls from all over India descends upon [[Goa]]. Thus begins an impromptu [[bachelorette party]], and a riotous roller-coaster ride of girl-bonding. Amidst the fun and frenzy, the girls are oblivious of the impending doom and go on living life like there is no tomorrow.  Everything's set for a night of celebration. There's only one issue: Frieda won't say who her betrothed is. As they banter their way through celebration, their conversation, derived entirely from improvisations among the actors, covers everything from sex to street harassment to the buff (and often shirtless) next-door neighbour. During the trip, the women are harassed and they react boldly. Their harassers are enraged and they are shaken.  As the holiday progresses, we become acquainted with the women's dreams, desires, fears and, above all, their unwavering bond with one another -a bond that eventually takes them to extreme lengths.  Later, the ladies come to know that Freida is getting married to Nargis (which is illegal under the IPC section 377). A night before the marriage, the group decides to party . At the party, a heated argument between Jo and the ladies regarding her accent leads Jo to walk out, but the party continues till late in the night. When they decide to go home, they look about for Jo . She is found dead on the beach, apparently raped. The doctor, who arrives in the ambulance, refuses to remove her before the police come as she is already dead. The police reach shortly and the police officer in charge ([[Adil Hussain]]) conducts his preliminary inquiries in a manner that shames the women, reiterating their lack of faith in a patriarchal society that treats women shabbily.  They go home, distraught and frustrated.  Su's daughter Maya had followed Jo when she left the party and took photos of her subsequently. The pictures reveal that it is the group of men who had harassed the friends earlier that raped Jo. One of the women, Su, heads back to the beach with a gun. The rest of the group chases after her. Su shoots 3 of the rapists before Nargis stops her, Mad takes the gun and kills the other two. At Jo's funeral, the group makes a series of sentimental speeches, Nargis' speech summarizing the worth of a woman and hopes that in the next lives of women, they would be able to write their own stories. The police officer interrupts the ceremony, asking for a confession of guilt from the women and wanting them to stand up. The story has an open-ended conclusion with the entire congregation in the church standing up in solidarity with the women.

He tells his mother of his intentions to marry Maado. Angrej's mother disapproves of the relationship, but his sister-in-law agrees to arrange for the marriage.  Later, when Angrej goes to inform Maado of the impending marriage proposal, he is caught by Maado's father. Before he could do anything, a snake bites him and he loses his ability to speak as a result of partial paralysis. Haakam, a rich landlord from Lahore and a distant relative of Maado's grandmother begins to frequently visit their house and falls in love with Maado. Angrej sells his buffalo in order to buy jewellery for Maado. However, she tells him that her family disapproves of his financial condition. She gives in to the advances made by Haakam, who brings her various gifts. Angrej is heartbroken when he witnesses a secret meeting between the two; Hakkam had brought a [[Antique radio#Table-top wood-cased radios|wood-cased radio]] for Maado from Lahore, much to her amusement.  Angrej's family is invited to his cousin's wedding, where he meets Dhann Kaur, his cousin's friend and the daughter of a wealthy aristocrat. The two also develop a friendship over the course of the next few days. Maado and her family are also present at the wedding. Kaur helps Angrej in getting back with Maado, but is herself attracted to him. Haakam arrives at the wedding with the groom's ''[[baraat]]''; that night, he makes a pass at many women including Kaur. Angrej rebukes him and the two engage in a fight, but are later pacified by Maado's father. Hakkam continues to flirt with women and is caught by Maado the following day. Angrej consoles her and the two rekindle their romance. The wedding concludes on the day of the ''[[Punjabi wedding traditions#Post-wedding rituals|vidai]]'' and the guests begin to return home. Angrej bids farewell to Kaur, who is smitten by him by this point.  Angrej begins to dress like a landlord and buys a pair of gold bangles for Maado. Impressed by his new appearance, Maado proposes him for marriage. Angrej realises that he does not love Maado any more but instead wants to be with Kaur, who loves him. Aslam intimates him of Kaur's impending wedding to a landlord's son. Angrej then pleads his case to Kaur's father, who is enraged by his indecency and impudence. He threatens to shoot an undeterred Angrej as Kaur watches helplessly. Maado's father, who has recovered from his paralysis, intervenes and vouches for Angrej. He is able to convince Kaur's father to agree to the wedding, much to the delight of the couple.  In the present day, Angrej scatters Kaur's ashes in the open fields around their old house as per her last wishes.

Anguish (2015 film)
  A teenage girl named Lucy ([[Amberley Gridley]]) and her mother Sarah ([[Karina Logue]]) are driving when Lucy asks her mother if she can go on a camping trip. When Sarah tells Lucy no, Lucy angrily gets out of the car only to be hit by an oncoming car.  Tess ([[Ryan Simpkins]]), a teenage girl that has suffered for years from what appears to be mental instability, has moved into a new house with her mother Jessica ([[Annika Marks]]), hoping to have a new start. As Tess and her mother are settling in, Tess skateboards by the road where Lucy was hit-while observing the cross that has Lucy's picture on it, an unseen force pushes Tess down in the dirt and won't let her leave. Eventually Tess is able to get up and walk home but is now beginning to see phenomena that Tess attributes to her hallucinations. Tess eventually comes upon Sarah's bookstore and says something to Sarah that only Lucy would know, which leaves Sarah suspicious. Eventually, Tess is forced to confront her hallucinations and looks into a mirror and witnesses her eye color changing from blue to brown repeatedly. After having what seems like a mental breakdown, Tess eventually collapses by the front door just as Jessica returns from work. Tess is taken to the hospital where she is put on constant supervision, medication and therapy. A priest from Jessica's local church comes by to see Tess and suggests that possession may be involved.  Tess is discharged and returns to her bedroom to see that Jessica boarded up Tess' bedroom window for Tess' protection. After still exhibiting paranormal phenomena and refusing to eat, Jessica is driving Tess into town when Tess suddenly lunges from the car and runs off into a neighborhood and eventually reaches Sarah and Lucy's house. Tess embraces Sarah while Jessica, who had followed Tess, looks on in confusion and fear. While 'Tess' explores Lucy's bedroom, Sarah explains to Jessica that Tess may have a gift where she can channel spirits and let them take possession of her own body so they can say goodbye to their loved ones and move on. Sarah believes that Lucy has taken possession of Tess and that by talking to Lucy through Tess' body, she can convince Lucy to move on. At first, Lucy says she does not want to leave and that Tess does not want to return because she is tired of the doctors and constant medicine but Sarah tells Lucy that moving on is the right thing to do and Lucy eventually agrees. Lucy leaves Tess' body, but another spirit has apparently entered Tess' body and lunges from the bed and tries to run away only to have Sarah and Jessica lock Tess in the basement. Jessica goes down to find Tess, promising that she'll do better as a parent, only to have 'Tess' run up and fight with her. After a struggle, Jessica is looking at Tess in fear when Lucy reenters Tess' body and wants to see her mother.  Lucy asks for one more night with her mother and Jessica agrees. After the night is over, Sarah tells Lucy that it's time to move on and Lucy exits Tess' body, finding herself in a type of spirit world surrounded by other spirits. Lucy wanders until she finds Tess who reveals that she wants to go back and hugs Lucy. Suddenly, an invisible force attacks Lucy and a bright light appears to signify that Lucy has moved on. Tess returns to her body and life seems to go back to normal, her mother not sure if Tess has improved or not. Later, in the coffee shop, Tess is asked her name but doesn't reply. Back at home, Tess is playing and singing a song (the same one Lucy made up while swinging) on her guitar; she looks up and her eye color changes from blue to brown.

Ant-Man (film)
  In 1989, scientist [[Hank Pym]] resigns from [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] after discovering their attempt to replicate his [[Ant-Man]] shrinking technology. Believing the technology is dangerous, Pym vows to hide it as long as he lives.  In the present day, Pym's estranged daughter, [[Hope Pym|Hope van Dyne]], and former protégé, [[Darren Cross]], have forced him out of his company, Pym Technologies. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the [[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]], which horrifies Pym.  Upon his release from prison, well-meaning thief [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] moves in with his old cellmate, Luis. Lang visits his daughter [[Cassandra Lang|Cassie]] unannounced and is chastised by his former wife Maggie and her police-detective fiancé, Paxton, for not providing child support. Unable to hold a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home. After trying the suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect.  Terrified by the experience, he returns the suit to the house, but is arrested on the way out. Pym, the homeowner, visits Lang in jail and smuggles the suit into his cell to help him break out.  Pym, who manipulated Lang through an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test, wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Cross. Having been spying on Cross after discovering his intentions, Van Dyne and Pym train Lang to fight and to control ants. While Van Dyne harbors resentment towards Pym about her mother Janet's death, he reveals that Janet, known as the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], disappeared into a subatomic [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Extradimensional places|quantum realm]] while disabling a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] nuclear missile. Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suit's regulator. They send him to steal a device that will aid their heist from the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]' headquarters, where he briefly fights [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]].  Cross perfects the Yellowjacket and hosts an unveiling ceremony at Pym Technologies' headquarters. Lang, along with his crew and a swarm of flying ants, infiltrates the building during the event, sabotages the company's [[server (computing)|servers]], and plants explosives. When he attempts to steal the Yellowjacket, he, along with Pym and Van Dyne, are captured by Cross, who intends to sell both the Yellowjacket and Ant-Man suits to [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]. Lang breaks free and he and Van Dyne dispatch most of the Hydra agents, though one flees with a vial of Cross' particles and Pym is shot. Lang pursues Cross, while the explosives detonate, imploding the building as Pym and Van Dyne escape.  Cross dons the Yellowjacket and attacks Lang before Lang is arrested by Paxton. Cross takes Cassie hostage to lure Lang into another fight. Lang overrides the regulator and shrinks to subatomic size to penetrate Cross' suit and sabotage it to shrink uncontrollably, killing Cross. Lang disappears into the quantum realm but manages to reverse the effects and returns to the [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] world. Out of gratitude for Lang's heroism, Paxton covers for Lang to keep him out of prison. Seeing that Lang survived and returned from the quantum realm, Pym wonders if his wife is alive as well. Later, Lang meets up with Luis, who tells him that Wilson is looking for him.  In a mid-credits scene, Pym shows Van Dyne a new Wasp prototype suit and offers it to her. In a [[post-credits scene]], Wilson and [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] have [[Bucky Barnes]] in their custody. Unable to contact [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] because of "[[Registration Acts (comics)#Marvel Cinematic Universe|the accords]]", Wilson mentions that he knows someone who can help.

The Anthem of the Heart
  The story revolves around a girl named Jun Naruse, a chatterbox. One day she sees her father come out from one love hotel with another woman and tells her mother, resulting in her parents' divorce. Her father blames her, saddening Jun. While she is crying, a fairy egg appears and seals her words so she won't hurt people  again.  When Jun is in high school, as the result of the "curse", Jun is [[elective mutism|unable to speak]]. Her homeroom teacher, Kazuki Jōshima, signs her up to Charity Committee members along with three other people: Takumi Sakagami, Natsuki Nitō, and Daiki Tasaki. Going to the committee room to properly reject becoming a committee member, Jun hears Takumi singing and is captivated. She then tells Takumi of her past and requests him to turn her words into a song, thinking that the curse won't apply if she's singing.   Jun, Takumi, and Natsuki decide to hold a musical performance, something that Daiki refuses as he mocks Jun for being unable to talk, but Jun proves herself by singing in front of the class. They decide to do a musical based on Jun's experience in the form of a fairy tale. While discussing the musical, Daiki has a falling out with his teammates that is stopped by Jun, who consequently has another stomachache for talking, but this improves her bonds with Takumi, Natsuki, and Daiki. Misunderstanding Takumi's concern for Jun as a sign that he is falling in love with her, Natsuki tells Takumi that she will cheer them on despite her own feelings for Takumi.  The next day, Daiki makes amends with his teammates. As they spend time together preparing for the musical, Jun starts to develop feelings for Takumi, while Daiki starts to develop feelings for Jun. Daiki asks Takumi regarding his relationship with Natsuki, having heard rumours that both of them were dating during middle school, but Takumi denies this since Natsuki had told her classmates then that they were not dating when she was asked. At the night before the musical, Takumi asks Natsuki about the boy she's dating currently, leading Natsuki to finally reveal that the boy she's referring to is none other than Takumi himself, before she accuses him of falling in love with Jun. Takumi reveals that while he is concerned about Jun, he is not in love with her and he has always regretted not trying to convey his feelings for Natsuki during middle school even when he was aware of her feelings for him at that time. Unbeknownst to them, Jun overhears their conversation. Heartbroken, she runs away and meets the fairy egg, who reveals that she has worsened the curse by trying to convey her feelings for Takumi. Jun doesn't show up on the day of the musical, leaving Natsuki to fill her role while Takumi frantically goes searching for her.   Takumi finds Jun at the love hotel that has been shut down. To his surprise, she is able to talk normally. Jun angrily lashes out at Takumi as he tells her that the reason she is unable to convey her words is not because of the fairy egg's curse but because of Jun's own fear. Wanting to hear her voice once more, Takumi allows Jun to lash out all of her anger and frustration until she is satisfied. Jun confesses her feelings for Takumi, but it is revealed that Takumi is still in love with Natsuki, to which Jun replies that she knew. Takumi then expresses his gratitude for Jun because before he met her, he was unable to say what he truly felt properly and only went along with everyone else. This convinces Jun to perform in the musical. Jun and Takumi arrives just in time before the final scene, allowing Jun to sing and convey her feelings to her mother who finally understands what she had been through. As the musical ends, Jun realises that the fairy egg was actually nothing but an imagination that she created to have someone she could blame for her condition, and now she decides to open up her heart, coming to terms with her past.   As the movie ends, Takumi and Natsuki reconciles their relationship, while Daiki finally confesses his feelings to Jun.

April and the Extraordinary World
 In 1870 on the eve of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], French Emperor [[Napoleon III]] visits the lab of Gustave Franklin to access his project of breeding invulnerable supersoldiers.  The emperor is disgusted with the results - two intelligent, talking komodo dragons ill-fit for war - and tries to shoot them, but the creatures escape and the emperor instead causes an explosion that kills both him and Gustave.  Napoleon III's [[Napoléon, Prince Imperial|successor]] then negotiates a settlement with [[Prussia]] to avert war.  Over the course of sixty years, renowned scientists such as [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] and [[Enrico Fermi|Fermi]] mysteriously disappear.  As a result, technological developments have been based on [[coal]], and then burning [[wood]] when the coal runs out.  By 1931, Europe has been depleted of trees, and the air has become so badly polluted that people need to wear masks to be outside for long periods of time.  The [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] now plans war for [[Canada|Canada's]] vast forests, and orders all remaining scientists to work for the empire in a desperate attempt to modernize its weapons.  Bumbling inspector Gaspar Pizoni pursues the descendants of Gustave Franklin in [[Paris]].  Gustave's son Prosper ("Pops" to his family), grandson Paul, granddaughter-in-law Annette and great-granddaughter April have continued to work on a serum for ever-lasting life, in hopes of improving the world's health.  Their work has produced a talking cat named Darwin, now April's companion.  Just when the serum is perfected, Pizoni's men raid their workshop and attempt to arrest them.  Pops escapes, but the rest flee to a cable car bound for [[Berlin]], with Annette hiding the serum in April's snowglobe.  A mysterious black cloud appears and destroys the cable car, seemingly killing April's parents.  April and Darwin later escape, and Pizoni is demoted for the disaster.  The disappearances continue for ten more years.  In 1941, a now adult April continues working on the serum to save a dying Darwin.  But Pizoni still obsessively hunts the Franklins, hiring petty criminal Julius to tail April.  When Darwin seems to die after taking April's latest serum, she spills the liquid from her snowglobe over Darwin, and Darwin is suddenly completely revived and invulnerable.  Just then, a rat appears, with advanced technology attached to it.  Through it, April hears a message of warning from her father, and then another cloud appears.  Julius helps April and Darwin escape.  April uses the message to finally reunite with Pops, who directs her to his home in a secret hiding place.  Julius reluctantly turns Pops over to Pizoni.  The authorities take Pops to a government weapons research center in [[Fort-la-Latte]], but also imprison Pizoni there for disobeying orders.  There, Pops finds other scientists studying a mysterious machine found at the bottom of the sea, which turns out to be an [[airplane]] powered by [[electricity]].  In the meantime, Julius returns to April just when a group of strange cyborg soldiers attack Pops's house.  April discovers that the house can convert into a rocket, and so she, Julius and Darwin use the house to flee to Fort La-Latte.  The house breaches the fort, causing a flood and destroying the house, their only means of escape.  April, Julius, and Darwin instead escape on the plane, which Pops has repaired, with Pizoni, hoping for revenge and one last shot at being reinstated, stowed away. On the plane they find a film that reveals that the two komodo dragons bred by Gustave have been the ones kidnapping scientists.  The komodos, Rodrigue and Chimene, have used the scientists to create a jungle ecosystem underneath Paris, where the scientists work alongside the lizards' offspring on an ambitious, mysterious project.  The lizards remotely hijack the plane, but Pizoni brings the plane down in the jungle.  April, Darwin, and Julius reunite with her mother, who reveals the lizards' ultimate project: launching a rocket loaded with vegetation made invulnerable from the serum to other planets, terraforming them to escape the humans' wars, pollution, and violence.  April discovers that it was actually her own serum instead of the snowglobe's serum that revived Darwin. Pops and Pizoni are captured, and find Paul a prisoner for rebelling against the project, among others who have rebelled, not trusting the lizards' motives.  Before reuniting with Annette, April's group causes a blackout that frees the prisoners.  Pizoni tries to escape while Pops and Paul try to find the others.  At the rocket's launch, April remakes her serum and Julius hands it to Rodrigue.  But Rodrigue, the more war-like of the couple, drinks the serum and reveals his master plan: using the rocket's crash to wipe out humanity and reterraforming the surface, leading the komodo dragons to world domination.  Rodrigue kills Chimene when she tries to stop him, but then Julius reveals that he handed Rodrigue water instead, and then fatally shoots him.  Only Darwin is able to reach the rocket's controls to redirect the rocket to space.  Right before the rocket launches, April douses the vegetation on the rocket with her serum, fulfilling Chimene's plan.  The Franklins, Julius and the scientists join Pizoni in escaping to the surface, and witness the rocket exploding in space.  A news item reveals Pizoni becoming the head of the emperor's personal guard in reward for his "work" "foiling" the lizards' plot.  A time lapse scene then shows the freed scientists rapidly advancing technology.  The scientists perfect [[Petroleum|oil]] as an energy source, ending wars over fuel sources, and invent many electric appliances.  April continues to work on the serum, but never finds a way to make it work for humans.  The invulnerable vegetation has spread all over the [[Moon]], [[Venus]] and [[Mars]].  Man finally reaches the Moon in 2001, where astronauts discover Darwin still alive.  An elderly Julius breaks the happy news to his wife, April.

He ventures back into the desert where he encounters Ben, who has been waiting for the three to return. Darrin frantically explains that their group was separated and urges Ben to drive away. However, their car’s engine promptly dies and the camcorder captures both men being abducted from the car.

Later, as Dave and Sylvie search for an apartment together, Sylvie tells Dave that Kenny invited her to Christmas dinner. Dave tells her that she must come, insisting that Kenny will find it strange if she doesn't.   At the Christmas dinner at Mariette's house, Kenny tries to pour Dave a glass of wine, but Dave tells him that he is now sober, which upsets Kenny. Mariette pulls Dave aside later and asks him when he is going to tell Kenny that Sylvie is pregnant with his child; Dave avoids the question. Later, Kenny invites Dave to come with him to the club where Sylvie works.   At the club, Dave tries to tell Kenny about the situation with Sylvie, but Kenny gets distracted watching Sylvie; he thinks she is flirting with her boss, Chalid. Kenny goes to confront Chalid and insults him, eventually beating him up after Chalid suggests that Kenny can no longer properly take care of Sylvie. As Kenny leaves the bar, he tries to apologize to Sylvie, but she rebuffs his apology, telling Kenny that she stopped visiting him in prison because he only reminded her of all the mistakes she'd made in her life.   The next day, while Kenny is at work at the car wash, he gets attacked by two of Chalid's goons. Kenny manages to overpower them, but Robert sees the fight and fires both Dave and Kenny. That night, Kenny borrows Dave's car and uses it to follow Sylvie after work. Again, he sees her talking with Chalid. Immediately after, Dave gets a phone call from Kenny and meets him in a parking garage. Kenny has a body in the trunk and needs Dave's help to dispose of it; Kenny claims that he tried to stand up to Chalid but that Chalid fell and cracked his head. Kenny says that his cellmate from prison, Stefan (Jan Bijvoet) is going to help them dispose of the body; Dave is reluctant to help, until Kenny threatens to tell the police that Dave was his accomplice in the robbery that got him arrested years ago.   Kenny and Dave drive out to [[the Ardennes]], with the body still in the trunk of Dave's car. They meet Joyce ([[Sam Louwyck]]), Stefan's transvestite lover, who brings them to Stefan's property - a trailer in the middle of the forest. At Stefan's trailer, Kenny and Stefan snort cocaine off a knife while Joyce makes them pancakes. The gamekeeper for the forest, Gérard ([[Eric Godon]]) and his dog, Ricardo, arrive suddenly at Stefan's trailer to inform Stefan that some ostriches have gotten loose and are wandering the countryside. Gérard tells them that if they encounter an ostrich, they should call him right away, as ostriches can actually be quite violent and dangerous. Ricardo begins to bark at Dave's trunk; Gérard goes to investigate and sees the body. Gérard pretends as though he has not seen anything amiss, and gets into his car to go "warn the other residents" about the ostriches. However, Kenny knows that Gérard has seen the body; he grabs the cocaine knife and stabs Gérard in the neck with it. Gérard bleeds to death on the ground in front of Kenny and Stefan; Dave, shocked, runs off into the forest.   Dave emerges from the forest and hitches a ride to the nearest police station. While waiting to speak to an officer, Kenny arrives and sits down beside him in the lobby. Kenny begs Dave for help disposing of both of the bodies; Kenny promises that if Dave helps, he will leave Dave and Sylvie alone forever. Dave hesitates for a moment but eventually relents and follows Kenny outside the station, where Stefan and Joyce are waiting in separate cars. Kenny tells Dave to go with Joyce and get Gérard's body from Stefan's trailer.  At the trailer, Joyce pulls a gun on Dave. However, before Joyce can kill Dave, he smashes a glass over Joyce's head and they get into a long and brutal fight. Dave eventually gains the upper hand and kills Joyce; he then sets Stefan's trailer on fire, with Joyce's body inside.   Meanwhile, Kenny and Stefan are in a warehouse chopping up Gérard's corpse. Dave pulls up outside the warehouse, and Kenny and Stefan emerge, thinking that Joyce has returned with Dave's body. To their surprise, Dave emerges from the car holding a gun. Kenny tries to calm Dave down, but he cocks the gun in Kenny's face, intent on killing him. At that moment, two ostriches emerge from the forest and attack Kenny and Dave. Dave shoots at the ostriches, and the gunfire alerts a nearby police officer of their location.   Dave manages to scare off the ostriches, but he loses his gun in the scuffle. Stef, who is furious that Dave has killed Joyce, hits Dave with his car; Dave is injured but alive. Stef gets out of the car, wielding a tire iron, and walks towards Dave. Before he can kill him, however, Kenny picks up the gun and shoots Stef in the face, killing him instantly.   As the sound of police sirens approach in the distance and Dave lies bleeding, Kenny puts the gun against his head, intending to commit suicide. However, just as he is about to pull the trigger, Dave calls Sylvie's cellphone. Her ringtone can be heard coming from somewhere nearby; Kenny takes her phone out of his pocket. Dave stands up, and upon realizing what has happened, opens the trunk of his car. Sure enough, it is not Chalid's body in the trunk, but Sylvie's, lifeless and wrapped in a tarp. Dave attacks Kenny, screaming that Sylvie was pregnant. He crawls on top of Kenny and points the gun at his forehead.   At that moment, several police cruisers arrive. The officers get out of their vehicles and shout at Dave to drop his weapon. He does not respond, continuing to hold the gun against Kenny's head, and the police eventually shoot him. Kenny is arrested by the police as Dave's body lies next to Sylvie's, illuminated by the light from the police cars.

Arrowhead (2015 film)
 While escaping a political prison on a mining colony, Kye Cortland is forced to amputate his foot to save himself and the other prisoners from being torn apart by the mining machinery.  Cortland is recruited to join the rebellion against General Lang, who won a civil war against General Hatch.  Hatch explains to Cortland that his father, an important figure to the rebellion, is scheduled to be executed in several months on the anniversary of Lang's victory.  Hatch wants Cortland, an accomplished pilot, to hijack a scientific vessel, retrieve its data, and use it to help Hatch free Cortland's father.  Cortland receives a cybernetic foot and agrees.  Onboard the ''Arrowhead'', Cortland wakes from suspended animation early and hacks into the vessel's data banks.  He is concerned when this appears to lower the ship's defenses, but Hatch remotely assures him that it will be temporary and perfectly safe.  A dangerous EMI flare-up prevents Cortland from sending the data to Hatch and damages the ship, forcing it to eject all the escape pods.  Cortland escapes in a shuttle, landing near the escape pods on a desert moon.  The ship's AI, RE3F, warns him of a toxic atmosphere but refuses to give further data without a valid login.  Exploring, Cortland finds the body of ''Arrowhead''s security chief, Norman Oleander, and an intact pod with biologist Tarren Hollis.  Cortland brings Hollis back to the shuttle and, after reviving her, uses her biometric data to activate RE3F.  Hollis surmises Cortland is working for Hatch, who she says has been engaging in terrorist attacks; Cortland dismisses her accusations as propaganda.  Hollis, who recognises Cortland as a soldier who served with her father, offers him a fair trial if he accompanies her to a rendezvous point where survivors will be rescued.  Cortland declines.  Cortland rejoins her when RE3F refuses to start the shuttle's engines with Hollis' login.  On the way, a hostile insectoid creature attacks and apparently kills Cortland, causing Hollis to miss the rescue.  A nearby obelisk resurrects Cortland, infecting him with a symbiote and healing all his wounds, including his foot.  Hollis and Cortland drag Oleander's body to the same obelisk, resurrecting him and using his biometric data to unlock all of RE3F's functions.  Hollis convinces Cortland not to leave Oleander behind.  However, when Oleander revives, he begins ranting and turns hostile.  After Oleander shoots Hollis, Cortland kills him and collapses from his own wounds.  When Cortland revives, RE3F tells him he was dead for thirty-four days.  The symbiote has again revived him, but Hollis is gone, apparently dead.  With RE3F's help, Cortland works to restore the shuttle's power and escape the moon in time to rescue his father.  Cortland discovers his symbiote causes him to transform into the insectoid creature during periods of intense stress or pain.  After suffering an uncontrolled transformation, Cortland misses the anniversary.  Resigned, Cortland spends the next three years bonding with RE3F, learning to control his transformation, and surviving on the moon.  RE3F cannot volunteer information and must be asked questions.  After a chance comment, Cortland learns from RE3F that Hollis survived the fight and possibly escaped the moon.  Cortland is frustrated RE3F unwillingly withheld the information but scavenges parts from the shuttle to upgrade RE3F, giving it a mobile frame.  Grateful, RE3F illegally grants Cortland access to confidential information, revealing that the moon is the subject of a relativistic [[time dilation]] experiment.  Hatch and Lang want to use the planet offensively against each other's forces.  Hatch lands on the moon, explaining that 20 minutes have passed from his point of reference.  He has captured Hollis and threatens to kill her unless Cortland hands over the scientific data.  Realizing Hatch, who admits to mass murder in pursuit of his goal, never intended him to survive, Cortland refuses.  Cortland wounds Hatch with a grenade initially embedded in his cybernetic foot, then kills him by transforming.  Hollis talks him down and helps him transform back to a human.  The two plan to leave the moon and not only free Cortland's father but everyone else, too.

By 1933, there are [[Korean independence movement|over 30 Korean independence factions]] operating in [[Korea]], [[China]], and [[Manchuria]]. Yem has become a captain in one of these factions, but his colleagues are unaware that he is [[double agent|secretly reporting to the Japanese]], since back in 1911 he was [[brainwashing|tortured by the Japanese into submission]].  Yem meets with [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea|some Korean politicians]] in [[Hangzhou]], including [[Kim Koo]] and [[Kim Won-bong]], and is asked to gather three delinquent resistance members—Big Gun, Duk-sam, and Ahn Okyun—so they can enter [[Seoul]] and assassinate Kang, along with a general named Kawaguchi Mamoru. After bringing them to [[Shanghai]], however, Yeom sells this information to the Japanese. The Japanese attempt to find Ahn, but a skilled [[Contract killing|contract-killer]] named Hawaii Pistol decides, on the spur of the moment, to pretend that Ahn is his wife, allowing her to elude the soldiers.  Kim Koo questions Yem's loyalty giving Yem's subordinates, Myung-woo and Se-gwang, orders to kill him if he is a spy. However, Yem manages to come out the victor instead. Additionally, Yem hires Hawaii Pistol to intercept and kill the three resistance members, telling Hawaii Pistol that they are Japanese spies, anticipating a great reward from the Japanese. As Hawaii Pistol and his assistant Buddy travel to Seoul, they befriend Kawaguchi's son, who is a lieutenant in the [[Kwantung Army]]. In Seoul, Hawaii Pistol locates Big Gun and shoots him as he is running. With Big Gun missing, Duk-sam and Ahn proceed with the operation, hoping to ambush their targets at a gas station. To their misfortune, the car is a decoy and both Duk-sam and Korean sympathizer Kimura are killed in the attempt. Ahn is then ambushed by Hawaii Pistol, but he recognizes and spares her, and even sympathizes with her mission, [[Korean ethnic nationalism|since he is himself a Korean]].  Ahn discovers that she is Kang's missing twin daughter. The other daughter, who happens to be engaged to Kawaguchi's son, recognizes Ahn and visits her apartment, but is killed by her father Kang, Yem and a group of soldiers. The latter are none the wiser and believe they have successfully killed Ahn. At this point, Ahn assumes her twin's identity, and a few days later, enters the wedding as the bride. Assisted by Hawaii Pistol, Buddy, and Big Gun—who survived his injuries—they carry out an attack on the wedding. Ahn kills Kawaguchi, and Hawaii Pistol kills Kang when Ahn hesitates to do so, revealing that he killed his father, a Japanese sympathizer, and did not want Ahn to live with that and become a mercenary like him. Big Gun is killed while covering their escape, taking Kawaguchi's son hostage, they are hemmed in by army reinforcements. Hawaii Pistol, realizing that she can still pose as her twin, shares a kiss with Ahn, promising to meet her again in the cafe they met in Shanghai. Ahn walks out and is rescued by the Japanese soldiers—she later absconds back to Shanghai. Hawaii Pistol and the Buddy attempt to escape but Yem kills them.  For his services to Japan, Yem is made head of the [[secret police]]. However, the Japanese are defeated in [[World War II]] and Korea is liberated. In 1949, a commission for [[war crime]]s investigates Yem—now a senior officer with the Korean police—who protests his innocence and points to his resistance service. The only witness to Yem's guilt is found murdered, so the charges are dropped. Even so, Yem is cornered on the streets by Ahn and Myung-woo, who survived his injuries earlier in the film but was rendered mute and slightly disfigured. They proceed to shoot Yem and he dies. Ahn sadly recalls her friends in the Resistance, Hawaii Pistol and Buddy before the screen fades out.

Meanwhile, Nagisa Shiota, a ninth-grade student of Kunugigaoka Junior High School, narrates of how he came to be sent to the situation he is in: he is included in Class 3-E, which is reserved for delinquents and other undesirables of the school and is a laughing stock among the school. However, Class 3-E is actually a cover up for the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] in their attempt to assassinate Koro-sensei, a [[tentacle]]d creature apparently responsible for the Moon's destruction. The students have to assassinate him before graduation using either a special knife or [[BB gun|BB pellet]], the time when he plans to destroy Earth, but at the same time also have to study both academic and assassination disciples from him. In teaching, Koro-sensei is assisted by the government-affiliated Tadaomi Karasuma and Irina Jelavić, a [[Serbs|Serb]] assassin.  Despite being fully aware that he is their ultimate target, Koro-sensei is able to bond with Class 3-E, who in turn regard him as their indispensable teacher. When asked why he took the job, he says it is done to fulfill a promise made to someone. Throughout the school term, Class 3-E welcomes three additional students: Karma Akabane, who has recently come out of his suspension due to protecting a former Class 3-E pupil from being bullied by Class 3-A students; "Ritsu", an [[Artificial intelligence|AI]]-box displaying the form of a girl; and Itona Horibe, the also-tentacled self-proclaimed "blood brother" of Koro-sensei who is carried away from the school by his cloaked guardian after losing a match against the latter. At one time, Karasuma's position as [[Physical education|P.E.]] teacher is briefly replaced by his rival, Akira Takaoka, a [[drill instructor]]-esque individual. He is challenged by Karasuma, who successfully sends Nagisa to threaten him, thereby expelling him from the school.  Before the finals, Koro-sensei promises that the top scorers of the five academic subjects ([[Chemistry]], [[English language|English]], [[Home economics|Home Economics]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Mathematics|Maths]]) will be awarded chance to cut his tentacles, which will greatly slow him. When the results for the finals are out, three students are able to jointly top the Home Economics test, thus granting seven students the chance to cut the tentacles. The students plan the killing during the summer holiday, where they reminisce about their kind past teacher, Aguri Yukimura. Eventually, Class 3-E manages to bind Koro-sensei thanks to Nagisa's observation of his weakness: water. However, Koro-sensei transforms into a ball to avoid being killed. Suddenly, the class is interrupted by a vengeful Takaoka, who poisons several students. He agrees to trade the antidotes for Koro-sensei.  Nagisa and Karma team up to incapacitate Itona, now working for Takaoka, by luring him into open rain and subsequently cutting his tentacles. However, they are alerted by Ritsu that Takaoka has kidnapped Kaede Kayano and threatens to kill her unless Koro-sensei is handed over. With a trick, Class 3-E turns the table over and defeats Takaoka without giving in. Seeing that Koro-sensei is vulnerable, the government takes him and proceeds to do a public execution in front of his grieving students. However, he manages to survive the attempted killing and is allowed to continue teaching Class 3-E for the next term, with Itona now enrolling permanently. Koro-sensei then reminisces about the person he made his promise with: Aguri Yukimura.

After meeting their friend, Kami, who is planning to immigrate from Iran, they cause a road accident. A mysterious stranger, Toofan, tells them he has settled the accident issue by paying off the other driver. Here the plot shifts from realistic to  spooky and metaphysical, when Toofan keeps on re-appearing, talking about dead dictators, weapons of mass destruction and parallel worlds.  The director said about the movie, after its screening at the Berlin Festival:<ref></ref> {{quote| text=The first part is reality and the second is dream. When the actor Mohammed Reza Golzar appears, the film changes from the real to the surreal. The concept of this division into real and surreal is that in the first part, the main topic is peace. For me it is important to show a part of Iran and a part of the youth, that is different from the reception from the outside of the country. It was my intention to show also this part of society. It was to introduce the iranian society as it is today, and to end up the first part with the peace song of Michael Jackson...  Then the topics change, to war themes and those of a dictatorship. }}  
The Atticus Institute
 The story of the film is presented in [[documentary]] format, with footage of the events punctuated by interviews with people related to them.  In the early 1970s, Dr. Henry West ([[William Mapother]]) founds the Atticus Institute in rural [[Pennsylvania]], hoping to find evidence that proves supernatural abilities such as [[extrasensory perception|ESP]] are real. Despite the best work of West and his aides, however, every subject that comes to the institute seeming to display such abilities are ultimately proven to be frauds. The team is demoralized in their work by the time Judith Winstead ([[Rya Kihlstedt]]) is brought to the institute by her sister Margaret, who is troubled by her disturbing behavior. Judith immediately proves to be a different case than the previous subjects, passing all the tests with incredible proficiency and leaving no doubt that her abilities are genuine. Her behavior remains erratic, however, and many of West's staff become uncomfortable with her, even while their boss's fascination with her increases. With the usual tests proving to be no challenge for Judith's incredible power, the team gradually introduces new tests that show her to possess even greater abilities than first imagined.  Judith's behavior grows more unstable as her abilities evolve, disturbing West's staff. Bizarre events begin to happen to the aides and their families outside of the institute, which they suspect Judith is somehow influencing, and many of them resign from their positions to escape from her. As the situation escalates, the team seeks help from the United States military; under the influence of military advisors, they conduct new tests that lead to Judith manifesting new abilities such as [[telekinesis]] and [[pyrokinesis]]. One day, Judith experiences a violent reaction to a spectral photography experiment, and when the images are checked, a cloud-like entity is observed temporarily leaving Judith's body during her convulsions. This leads the team to realize that Judith's powers are the result of demonic possession.  With this discovery, the military seizes full control of the institute under a pretext of national security, and the situation spirals completely out of control. Soon, the military decides that Judith's abilities can be utilized as a weapon against the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]], and they begin conducting increasingly inhumane experiments on Judith against West's objections. Using methods such as [[electroshock therapy]], the military try to tame the demon and force it to cooperate in exercises such as identifying the location of enemy bases, ignoring the effects these tests have on Judith. As these experiments ultimately prove fruitless, the military decides to try removing the demon from Judith by having a priest perform an exorcism while a soldier is connected to Judith via machinery. The process shows promise at first, but Judith suddenly lashes out and gravely injures the priest, disconnecting the electrodes attached to her before passing out. As the staff try to reattach the electrodes, Judith experiences a violent seizure while the demon attacks West through the body of the soldier connected to her. An unseen force blasts through the facility, killing all present. As the cameras come back online, Judith - now free of the demon's control and restored to her true self - breaks down when she sees the carnage around her. The demon enters the room in West's body, having fully consumed his soul, and stands before Judith's cell as she pleads for help. West kills Judith by telekinetically bursting her heart, then calmly exits the room and disappears.  The film concludes with a note revealing that Judith's body was buried in an undisclosed location following an autopsy, and her case remains the only instance of possession officially certified by the United States government. Dr. Henry West, after disappearing on October 23, 1976, was declared legally dead in 1982 and his whereabouts have been unknown for over forty years.

After their failed attempt to approach the wall, Souda, the captain of the Garrison, explains to them that the military is assembling a scouting regiment to explore beyond the walls. However, the wall is suddenly attacked by the Colossal Titan. The wall is breached and Titans enter the village, eating people and getting back up despite being injured. When Mikasa tries to rescue a baby, she is separated from Eren, and is presumed killed.  Two years later, Eren and Armin enter the Scout Regiment, along with Sasha, Jean, and others. The team, led by Military Police Commander: Kubal, move out into one of the towns of the Outer Wall. The group is then attacked by Titans but are saved by Captain Shikishima and Mikasa, who survived the attack from two years ago and is now part of the Scouts. Eren eventually confronts Mikasa and she reveals to him that the experience made her realize the world is cruel. After realizing that Mikasa and Shikishima are most likely together, Eren is once again devastated.  When more Titans surprise them, Kubal retreats, leaving the Scouts to fend for themselves. Lil, who had just lost her lover, sacrifices herself. Jean attempts to convince Eren to flee, but Eren chooses to fight back before losing his leg in the process. Eren manages to save Armin from being eaten but at the cost of his own life. Though crushed by Eren's death, Mikasa keeps fighting until she runs low on fuel and comes face to face with the same Titan that ate Eren. However, a Titan emerges from within it and begins battling the other Titans. Souda and Mikasa realize that the Titan is Eren. After he starts to collapse, Mikasa frees Eren from his Titan shell.  ===Part 2=== Years before, a young Eren is forcibly injected with an experimental serum by his father, but soon after Eren's mother discovers this, a military police squad break in and kill Eren's parents. Eren survives with the help of Souda. In the present, Eren is captured by Kubal and his squadron, believing he is a threat to humanity. Armin tries to convince Kubal of Eren's innocence but is ignored. Before Eren is executed, another intelligent Titan appears, seemingly killing Kubal and his squadron before fleeing with Eren. Eren awakens in a mysterious bunker with Shikishima, who reveals the origins of the Titans as a military experiment gone wrong that soon developed into a virus that decimated humanity  and his plans to launch a coup against the corrupted government. Eren agrees to help.  Eren, Shikishima, and his troops reunite with Mikasa and the others. Shikishima attempts to recruit them into his coup, but when the true sinister purpose behind his plan is revealed, Eren backs out. The remaining regiment neutralize Shikishima's troops and Shikishima reveals himself to be the Titan that took Eren earlier. Eren transforms into his Titan form and battles the Shikishima Titan, with Eren emerging victorious in the end. Titan Eren proceeds to climb the wall and plants a bomb to create a massive blockage to prevent more Titans from entering.  Having survived the earlier attack, Kubal attempts to stop the group but is shot by Sasha, forcing him to transform into the Colossal Titan. As Eren, Jean, and Mikasa battle the Colossal Titan, Shikishima reappears in his Titan form and sacrifices himself by lodging the bomb into the Colossal Titan's mouth, killing them both. The detonation successfully closes the hole in the wall and Eren and Mikasa stand at the top of the wall overlooking the ocean.  In a [[post-credits scene]], footage of the battle with the Colossal Titan is analyzed, in Shikishima's bunker, by an off-screen character, who says that Eren and Mikasa's unpredictability is what makes them "fascinating".

  In the [[Eastern Europe]]an country of Sokovia, the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]—[[Tony Stark]], [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Bruce Banner]], [[Natasha Romanoff]], and [[Clint Barton]]—raid a [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] facility commanded by Baron [[Wolfgang von Strucker]], who has been experimenting on humans using the scepter previously wielded by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. They encounter two of Strucker's test subjects—twins [[Pietro Maximoff]], who has superhuman speed, and [[Wanda Maximoff]], who has telepathic and telekinetic abilities—and apprehend Strucker, while Stark retrieves Loki's scepter.  Stark and Banner discover an [[Artificial intelligence in fiction#Sentient AI|artificial intelligence]] within the [[Infinity Gems#Film|scepter's gem]], and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's "[[Ultron]]" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron, believing he must eradicate humanity to save Earth, eliminates Stark's A.I. [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]] and attacks the Avengers at [[Stark Tower|their headquarters]]. Escaping with the scepter, Ultron uses the resources in Strucker's Sokovia base to upgrade his rudimentary body and build an army of robot drones. Having killed Strucker, he recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible for their parents' deaths by his company's weapons, and goes to the base of arms dealer [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Ulysses Klaue]] to obtain [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakandan]] [[vibranium]]. The Avengers attack Ultron and the Maximoffs, but Wanda subdues them with haunting visions, causing the Hulk (Banner) to rampage until Stark stops him with his anti-Hulk armor.  A worldwide backlash over the resulting destruction, and the fears Wanda's hallucinations incited, send the team into hiding at a safe house. Thor departs to consult with Dr. [[Erik Selvig]] on the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination, while [[Nick Fury]] arrives and encourages the team to form a plan to stop Ultron. In [[Seoul]], Ultron forces the team's friend Dr. Helen Cho, who is enslaved by Loki's scepter, to use her synthetic-tissue technology, together with vibranium and the scepter's gem, to perfect a new body for him. As Ultron uploads himself into the body, Wanda is able to read his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, the Maximoffs turn against Ultron. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff.  The Avengers fight amongst themselves when Stark secretly uploads J.A.R.V.I.S.—who is still operational after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet—into the synthetic body. Thor returns to help activate the body, explaining that the gem on its brow—one of the six [[Infinity Stones]], the most powerful objects in existence—was part of his vision. This "[[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]" and the Maximoffs accompany the Avengers to Sokovia, where Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. Banner rescues Romanoff, who awakens the Hulk for the battle. The Avengers fight Ultron's army while Fury arrives in a [[Helicarrier]] with [[Maria Hill]], [[War Machine|James Rhodes]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents to evacuate civilians. Pietro dies when he shields Barton from gunfire, and a vengeful Wanda abandons her post to destroy Ultron's primary body, which allows one of his drones to activate the machine. The city plummets, but Stark and Thor overload the machine and shatter the landmass. In the aftermath, the Hulk, unwilling to endanger Romanoff by being with her, departs in a [[Avengers Quinjet|Quinjet]], while the Vision confronts and seemingly destroys Ultron's last remaining body.  Later, with the Avengers having established a new base run by Fury, Hill, Cho, and Selvig, Thor returns to [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] to learn more about the forces he suspects have manipulated recent events. As Stark leaves and Barton retires, Rogers and Romanoff prepare to train new Avengers: Rhodes, the Vision, [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]], and Wanda.  In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], [[Thanos]], dissatisfied by the failures of his pawns, dons a gauntlet and vows to retrieve the Infinity Stones himself.

After finding a wooden mask on the ground, he is driven to find the owner of the mask and succeeds in climbing the waterfall. The mask belongs to Avanthika ([[Tamannaah]]), a rebellious warrior of a group led by Devasena's brother engaged in guerrilla warfare against Emperor [[Bhallaladeva (character)|Bhallaladeva]] ([[Rana Daggubati]]) of Mahishmati to rescue their former queen Devasena ([[Anushka Shetty]]). Avantika is given the opportunity to rescue the queen. She falls in love with Shivudu after finding out that he climbed the waterfall for her. Shivudu pledges to help her in her mission and sneaks into&nbsp;[[Mahishmati]] to rescue Devasena.  Sivudu manages to flee with Devasena, but is chased down by Bhallaladeva's son, Bhadrudu ([[Adivi Sesh]]) and the slave-soldier Kattappa ([[Sathyaraj]]). After Shivudu beheads Bhadrudu, Kattappa drops his weapon, realising that Shivudu is Mahendra Baahubali, the son of late king Amarendra Baahubali. He narrates the story of Amarendra's past. Amarendra's father had died long ago, while his mother died giving birth to him. His uncle Bijjaladeva ([[Nassar]]) was deemed unfit to rule due to his crooked nature, however he believes he was denied the throne due to the fact that one of his arms is disabled. Bijjaladeva's wife Sivagami assumed control of the kingdom with Kattappa's assistance until a new king could be selected. Amarendra was brought up together with Bijjaladeva and Sivagami's son Bhallaladeva. Both young men were trained in arts, science, disguise, politics, and warfare, but they had different approaches towards kingship. While Amarendra was gracious and loved his countrymen, Bhallaladeva was violent and achieved his goals by any means possible.  It was then discovered that Mahishmati was about to be attacked by an army of savages called [[Kalakeyas]]. Bijjaladeva proposed that the prince who killed the Kalakeya king Inkoshi would be the future king of Mahishmati to which Sivagami and the chief minister agrees. Inkoshi rejected Sivagami's offer of peace and insulted her by saying he will have children with her. An enraged Sivagami ordered that his limbs be chopped off and body fed to the vultures. While Bhallaladeva used sophiscated weapons given by Bijjaladeva, Amarendra used simple yet effective tactics. As Amarendra was about to slay the king, Bhallaladeva swung his weapon from a distance and killed him. Sivagami announced Amarendra as the new emperor despite Bhallaladeva killing the king because of the fact that he shielded and protected his own countrymen throughout the war.  When asked about Amarendra's current whereabouts, a tearful Kattappa reveals that Amarendra is dead, and that he is the one who killed him.

Backtrack (2015 film)
 Troubled [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapist]] Peter Bower suffers from nightmares and eerie visions ever since the death of his daughter Evie in a street accident a year earlier, which he blames himself for after he was briefly distracted by something in a store window and failed to notice her veer off the sidewalk. His wife Carol suffers extreme depression and rarely gets out of bed while he works in his practice, meeting some clients referred to him by his mentor, Duncan. One client, Felix, apparently suffers from [[anterograde amnesia]], believing that it is still the 80s; another, Erica, talks of her suicidal thoughts, but finds herself unable to commit suicide; and another, Elizabeth Valentine, is a girl who is apparently mute and who reacts with fear to the sound of the train passing by Peter's office, and before she flees, she writes a series of numbers on one of Peter's notepads: 12787.  Elizabeth returns unexpectedly, and Peter finds her looking out of his window to where the train will pass. Again, she is disturbed by the sound of it and begins to choke; she hits the window, leaving a handprint. Peter records her, but she disappears before he can speak to her further. He plays the recording to Duncan, who claims he hears nothing and believes that Peter is hallucinating Elizabeth out of guilt from failing to prevent his daughter's death, pointing out that her initials sound like Evie's name. Later, Peter hallucinates Elizabeth saying that "we have her" before turning into Evie and then vanishing, and later, he has a nightmare about Erica, who says she wasn't able to commit suicide because she's already dead. Doing research, Peter discovers that Elizabeth died in 1987, along with all the other clients who have been seeing him. The numbers that Elizabeth wrote on his notepad was a date: July 12, 1987. Perplexed, he calls Duncan and asks to speak with him later, and then has a vision of his deceased patients on the train outside of his window.  Duncan comes over, and Peter worries about his sanity and questions how Duncan could have referred the patients when all of them have been deceased for decades. He then notices that Duncan doesn't appear in a mirror, and he, too, is a ghost. Now fully disturbed, Peter uses a map to discover that all the deceased patients lived along a train line leading to his hometown, False Creek. He travels there alone and meets with his father, William, a retired cop. Going to the bar, Peter meets with a childhood friend, Barry, and tells him that there is a weight on his conscience that he wants lifted. Barry alludes to a horrifying event that happened in their youth that they promised to keep a secret, and tells Peter to leave him out of any confession.  When the two were teenagers, Barry led Peter to a secret location that his brother mentioned, where couples would apparently have sex in their cars. The two left their bikes at the side of the train tracks and went to go spy on a couple in a car. Peter panics when he hears a train whistle, and he raced to move their bikes; in the process, he saw what he thought was Barry, running ahead of him. However, neither got there in time, and the train was violently derailed, killing 47 of the passengers on board. Peter saw several of the victims, all of whom would be his deceased future clients. He is then terrorized by the ghosts of Evie, Felix, and Elizabeth.  The next morning, Barry drives to the train tracks, and Peter goes to the police station. There, he meets Barbara, a constable, and confesses the incident to her. She tells him that he will likely face no charges, as it was an accident that happened when he was a teenager, and the statute of limitations has expired. Peter also discovers that she was the daughter of Erica. He apologizes, and Barbara tells him that her mother was the only local killed in the accident, and that William was kind to her at the funeral, inspiring her to become a police officer.   Barbara investigates the accident while Peter tries and fails to burn his newspaper clipping of the accident. He is drawn to a closet, where the ghost of Elizabeth briefly strangles him. Duncan then appears, telling him that there was no way that bicycles lying against the tracks would have derailed the train, and that there was more to the accident. He also urges Peter to remember exactly what distracted him on the day of Evie's death. Peter recalls looking into a toy shop window at a railroad set, specifically, a model of a [[Signalling control|switch tower]]. The next morning, he investigates the switch tower beside the tracks and finds Barry, who has committed suicide, inside. When the police arrive, Peter confesses to Barbara that Barry was there the night of the accident, but he intentionally left him out of the confession. Later, he tells her about his hallucinations since Evie's death. When she does not believe him, he tells her details about Erica that he wouldn't otherwise know. Rattled, she orders him to leave.   A police officer finds an old and encrusted pin lying on the floor of the switch house and gives it to Barbara, who discovers that it's the insignia of Elizabeth's high school. As Peter once more returns to the scene of the accident, she pays a visit to William and tells him that during her investigation, she has discovered that the road he apparently drove to get to the aftermath of the crash was blocked off, and he would have only been able to drive there if his car had already been near the tracks. Furthermore, Elizabeth was the only victim with a cause of death that the coroners deemed inconclusive. Meanwhile, Peter sees Elizabeth's ghost once more, and, taking the same path he did as the night of the accident, he realizes that it was not Barry he saw running ahead of him, but Elizabeth. Going up to the switch house, he suddenly remembers all of the night: he looked through the windows of the house to see his father strangling Elizabeth. In her struggle to survive, she left a handprint on the window (the same one he saw earlier), and she also accidentally pulled the levers of the train tracks, leading it to derail and kill the passengers. Afterwards, William placed her body at the scene of the crash.  Barbara asserts to William that she knows Elizabeth was not a victim of the crash, and she believes that Peter saw something that night that William wanted covered up. William knocks her unconscious and puts her in the trunk of his car. Peter returns and tells William that he knows the truth: the couple that Peter and Barry saw in the car was really William raping Elizabeth, and he saw William kill her; he asks William if Elizabeth was his only victim. William pulls a gun on him and tells him to get in the garage. Inside, Peter hears Barbara regain consciousness, and after a brief struggle, William knocks him unconscious as well.  The next morning, William drives out with both Peter and Barbara restrained in the car. A gun is on the passenger seat. However, the ghost of Elizabeth appears in the road and in the car, startling William and making him lose control of the car. In the process, Peter is thrown out of the backseat of the car and ends up a safe distance away, with the gun. William ends up on the train tracks, the engine dead and the doors locked as a train begins to approach. He tries and fails to escape and yells to Peter for help. Peter attempts to shoot out a window so William can escape, but only succeeds when the train is extremely close. The trunk opens and Barbara manages to climb out, and Peter pushes her off the tracks to safety. William, held back by Elizabeth's ghost, is crushed by the train. As Peter and Barbara stand on the side of the tracks, Peter can see the ghosts of the victims on the train, and sees a tranquil Elizabeth turn and depart.  Later, Peter is on the beach with the ghost of Evie, who gets up and walks into the ocean, finally moving on and at peace. His wife joins him and asks what he's thinking about; Peter tells her that he's thinking about kids. Carol smiles, and they embrace.

Bajirao Mastani
 In the early 18th century, the court of [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] king [[Chhatrapati Shahu]] needs a new ''[[Peshwa]]'', the equivalent of a modern-day prime minister. In spite of Shripad Rao's self-nomination as the ''Peshwa'', Ambaji Pant nominates a young [[Bajirao I|Bajirao]]. To test his spiritual wisdom and knowledge of weaponry, Shripad challenges Bajirao to split a peacock feather with an arrow. Bajirao succeeds and is given the title of ''Peshwa''. Ten years later, his wife [[Kashibai]] is visited by her widowed friend Bhanu, whose husband was accused of spying and was ordered to be executed by Bajirao. She predicts that just as she longs for her husband, Kashibai will yearn for Bajirao.  While travelling to [[Sironj]]a, an emissary from [[Bundelkhand]] enters Bajirao's tent and requests his help to fight invaders. She reveals herself to be [[Mastani]], the daughter of the Hindu [[Rajput]] king [[Chhatrasal]] and his [[Persian people|Persian]] Muslim consort Ruhani Bai. Impressed by her skills as a warrior, Bajirao assists her with his army and defeats the invaders. Chhatrasal is overjoyed and insists Bajirao spend [[Holi]] with them in Bundelkhand. Mastani and Bajirao fall in love with each other and he gives her his dagger, unaware it is a symbol of marriage among the Bundelkhand Rajputs. Bajirao departs for [[Pune]], where Kashibai greets him with a tour of their newly-built [[Shaniwar Wada]] and shows him the [[Aina Mahal|Aaina Mahal]] (hall of mirrors), which allows her to see him from her room.   Determined to pursue her love, Mastani arrives in Pune but is treated harshly by Bajirao's mother Radhabai and accommodated in the palace for [[courtesan]]s. Mastani tolerates this insult and appears to dance before Bajirao. Radhabai scornfully offers her the occupation of a royal dancer but refuses to accept her as a daughter-in-law. Mastani travels to the Chhatrapati Shahu and expresses her desire to be with Bajirao, then leaves to wait for him at a ruin across a river. During a storm, Bajirao crosses the river and chides Mastani's persistence, reminding her he is already married and that his court will never respect her if she is in a relationship with him. She agrees, despite his warning, and he declares Mastani his second wife.  The Marathas prepare to attack [[Delhi]], the capital of the [[Mughal Empire]], but must first ensure the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]], the Muslim ruler of [[Hyderabad State]], will not attack them during their assault. Bajirao leaves to confront the Nizam, [[Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asif Jah I|Qamar ud-Din Khan]], and returns successful. In the Aaina Mahal, Kashibai, who is pregnant, sees Bajirao embracing Mastani, who is also expecting, and leaves for her mother's home. She returns to joyous celebrations months later with her newborn son, who is named [[Raghunathrao|Raghunath]]. Mastani also gives birth to a son, whom Mastani and Bajirao name Krishna Rao. After the head [[Brahmin]] priest Krishna Bhatt refuses to conduct the ''naamkaran'' (the Hindu naming ceremony) on the grounds that Krishna Rao is illegitimate, Bajirao renames his son [[Shamsher Bahadur]]. A few years later, Kashibai and Bajirao's eldest son [[Balaji Baji Rao]], also known as Nana Saheb, returns from [[Satara (city)|Satara]] and expresses his hatred of Mastani for disrupting his mother's marriage.  Shiva Bhatt, a Brahmin priest, informs Kashibai of a plan to murder Mastani and her son during a festival. Kashibai relays this news to Bajirao, who rescues both of them. Krishna Bhatt kills Shiva Bhatt, enraging Bajirao. To keep Mastani's safe and to grant her a royal home, Bajirao builds the Mastani Mahal for her. Bajirao, however, is heartbroken due to the betrayal of his mother Radhabai and his brother [[Chimaji Appa]]. Meanwhile, Pant tells Bajirao he must defeat [[Nasir Jung]], the vengeful son of the Nizam. Bajirao says that although he loves Mastani, his life and allegiance is always to his cause and he leaves for the battlefield. Before leaving, he meets Kashibai in deference to a tradition that the wife sent her husband off into battle. Kashibai tells Bajirao he has broken her heart and compares their love with that of [[Krishna]] and [[Rukmini]]. Kashibai orders him never to enter her chamber again, and Bajirao accepts and leaves.  After Bajirao leaves for battle, Radhabai and Nana Saheb imprison Mastani and Shamsher Bahadur. After Bajirao receives the news, he single-handedly defeats Nasir Jung's army in his rage but collapses from his injuries. At his deathbed, Kashibai sends a letter pleading with Radhabai to release Mastani so Bajirao can recover, but Nana Saheb burns the letter and refuses to release Mastani. Bajirao, delirious due to his sickness, dies from the trauma of his hallucinations; at the same time Mastani dies in captivity. The ill-fated lovers are shown to be united in death.

Robin falls out of the moving vehicle during the struggle, and Misha is shot by Liak. Harman jumps out of the car to protect the money. Both mother and son die from their injuries in the hospital.   '''Raghav "Raghu" Purohit''' ([[Varun Dhawan]]), shattered from the loss of both his wife and son, immerses himself in seeking revenge on both culprits. Liak is sentenced to 20 years in prison, but refuses to reveal the identity of his partner in crime. Raghu learns about '''Janki "Jhimli" Dagaonkar''' ([[Huma Qureshi (actress)|Huma Qureshi]]), a prostitute who is Liak's girlfriend, and visits her to inquire about the missing partner. After Liak's sentence, Raghu exiles himself to a reclusive life at a train station he gets off at – [[Badlapur]].  15 years later, a terminally-ill Liak is paroled from prison on compassionate grounds. Unknown to Liak, Raghu has facilitated the release by providing a letter of pardon for Liak to the court, in exchange for being told the partner's name by '''Zeenat''' ([[Pratima Kazmi]]), Liak's mother. Bent on vengeance, Raghu finds Harman, who now runs a well-established restaurant. Liak is kept under watch by police as they believe he will lead them to the unknown partner. Liak contacts Harman, and arranges to take his share of the money. However, Raghu has already interrogated Harman and Harman's wife '''Kanchan "Koko" Khatri''' ([[Radhika Apte]]). Harman tells Raghu that it was Liak and not him who killed his son and wife. Raghu is not convinced and takes Liak's share of the money, killing both Harman and Koko.  Raghu meets '''Shobha Thakur''' ([[Divya Dutta]]), the worker instrumental in arranging Liak's parole, pretending to be in love with her to create his alibi. He buries Harman and Kanchan's bodies, and police start investigating Harman. Liak learns from his mother Zeenat that Raghu came to know about Harman and breaks into Raghu's house in search of the money. Raghu beats him senseless, and Liak tells Raghu that it was him, not Harman, who killed Raghu's wife and child, but he did it in a moment of panic, unlike Raghu who, Liak points out, planned his murders with a cool mind and without guilt.  Liak meets Jhimli one last time; she, now a concubine of a local businessman, '''Shardul Patil''' ([[Zakir Hussain (actor)|Zakir Hussain]]), breaks down, knowing Liak is nearing death. The police now has circumstantial evidence that Raghu murdered Harman. Liak walks into the police station and takes Raghu's blame, giving him a second chance to live his life, and also doing one good thing in his own life before dying.  After seven months, Liak succumbs to cancer in jail. Jhimli meets Raghu and tells him that he has a second chance thanks to Liak, and should not waste it. She also asks Raghu, now that his revenge is complete and all the guilty are dead, as to what good it did for him. Raghu is silent as Jhimli drives away, leaving him standing in the rain.  
Bajrangi Bhaijaan
  In Sultanpur, a picturesque village in Pakistan, villagers gather to watch a televised [[2014_Asia_Cup#Fixtures_and_results|cricket match]] between [[India national cricket team|India]] and [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]]. Among them is a pregnant woman Rasia ([[Meher Vij]]) who, after giving birth, names her daughter Shahida after [[Shahid Afridi]], the player who wins the game for Pakistan. One afternoon, Shahida ([[Harshaali Malhotra]]), now six years old, falls off a cliff as she plays, and is saved by an overhanging tree, but was not able to call for help since she was mute. Since Shahida's father Rauf, a former Pakistani army man, is unlikely to be granted an Indian visa, a concerned Rasia takes her to the [[Nizamuddin Dargah|shrine]] of Sufi saint [[Nizamuddin Auliya]] in [[Delhi]], hoping it will restore Shahida's speech.  Returning from Delhi, [[Samjhauta Express|the train]] stops for repairs just short of the [[Wagah|Wagah crossing]] and Shahida gets off to save a lamb. The train drives off before Shahida can re-board it. Shahida then boards a [[Rail freight transport|freight train]], and winds up in [[Kurukshetra]], [[Haryana]]. There, she meets Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi alias Bajrangi ([[Salman Khan]]), a devout [[Hindu]] [[Brahmin]] and an ardent devotee of [[Hanuman|Lord Hanuman]]. He names her "Munni" and tries in vain to find out where she lives.  In sequences of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], it is revealed that Pawan has been a disappointment to his father, after failing in his school exams ten times. When he finally graduates on his eleventh try, his father dies of shock. Pawan, looking for a job, follows the advice of his father and goes to the house of his father's friend and wrestling coach, Dayanand Pandey ([[Sharat Saxena]]), in Delhi. Having spent time together with his daughter Rasika ([[Kareena Kapoor Khan]]), they fall in love with each other and Dayanand promises Rasika's hand in marriage on the condition that Pawan get a job and a separate house for himself.  In the present day, Pawan brings Munni to meet Dayanand, who lets Munni stay, believing that with her fair complexion, Munni must be a Brahmin as well. Munni gets accustomed to being part of the household. Both Pavan and Rasika eventually learn that Munni is a Pakistani Muslim as she performs [[Salah]] at a mosque, and cheers for the [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistani national cricket team]] during a televised India-Pakistan cricket match. An enraged Dayanand orders Pawan to make arrangements to have her sent to Pakistan through the [[High Commission of Pakistan, New Delhi|Pakistani High Commission]], where his pleading fails; the High Commission is then closed for a month due to protests. He is betrayed by a local travel agent who claims to be able to take Munni to Pakistan without a passport but rather takes her to a [[brothel]], causing him to destroy the brothel and beat up several of its occupants. Pawan then vows to take Munni to her parents in Pakistan by himself and without a passport and visa.  Pawan and Munni are able to enter Pakistan under the border's fences. Shortly after their arrival, however, Pawan is arrested under suspicions of being an Indian spy. He escapes with Munni and meets Chand Nawab ([[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]]), a journalist who works for a Pakistani television channel. Nawab has closely been following the developments. Moved by the story, Nawab decides to join Pawan to help him find Munni's parents. They encounter an Islamic religious scholar, Maulana Asad ([[Om Puri]]), who helps them avoid capture by police. He directs the group to [[Azad Kashmir|Pakistan Occupied Kashmir]], after Munni recognizes an area similar to her hometown in a photo from a calendar.  Nawab documents their journey on video, but his television station channel head Shamsher Ali ([[Harssh A. Singh]]) refuses to air it. Disappointed, he uploads the video on [[YouTube]] while Munni and Pawan attend a Muslim Pilgrimage to pray to find Munni's parents. While reviewing the footage, Munni recognizes her mother walking by in the background. With a bus driver's assistance, the trio identify Sultanpur as Munni's hometown. They board a bus to Sultanpur, however,  are stopped by police who are looking for "the Indian spy". Devising a plan to divert their attention, Pawan gets off the bus and runs toward the jungle in full view. He gets tracked down, beaten, and shot in the arm. Meanwhile, Nawab and Munni reach Sultanpur, where Munni is finally reunited with her mother.  The videos uploaded by Nawab go viral throughout India and Pakistan. A compassionate senior officer, Hamid Khan ([[Rajesh Sharma (actor)|Rajesh Sharma]]), realizes that Pawan is innocent, and has him released, defying the order to keep him in jail, which he felt would be petty on the part of Pakistan. Responding to a call by Nawab, thousands of Pakistanis and Indians congregate at Narowal Check Post, where Pawan is to return to India. As Pawan crosses the border, Shahida, who is also in the crowd, runs toward the fence and cries out "Maama" (In [[India]], Maama refers to the brother of someone's mother) with her now regained speech. Pawan and Shahida run towards each other and embrace.

Badmashiyaan
 The story starts off well, with a sweet Punjabi couple introducing the audience. The story then jumps to [[Chandigarh]], in 2014, where a frustrated man, while conversing on phone, loses control of his car due to a basketball and instantly applies brakes thereby also causing a public transport bus to stop, when the couple are just beside each other and fall over, sprouting up the love that led to their marriage.  While the frustrated man stops, a local taxi-driver Gurinder '''([[Anil Mange]])''' jumps out of his taxi and begins creating a scene against the frustrated man, who is then revealed to be enterprising cafè owner Dev Arora '''([[Sidhant Gupta]])''', the owner of a very popular cafè known as Cafè Konnect. Gurinder and Dev part ways, clearing the crowd that had accumulated there.  A rewind back to a recent history shows Dev's past, when, one day while taking photographs of a cute young woman he saw playing with balloons in the midst of children, he ended up saving another woman, Naari '''([[Suzanna Mukherjee]])''' and later took her to his cafè. Shortly after, the two entered a live-in relationship with Dev getting a huge loan following Dev's love instinct for Naari. However, despite a huge house and a big loan shark, Naari deserted Dev the very evening he wanted to propose to her during dinner at a five-star hotel on the pretext of using the washroom. Ever since that day, Dev did preserve Naari's belongings, but life for him has taken a back seat and he now has his hopes pinned on friend Pinkesh Kapoor '''(Karan Mehra)''', a part-time detective.  Back again to the foreground in the beginning, there is another typical Chandigarh couple which shares the first meet story. During their first meet, both the boy and the girl have a fight, particularly because the boy despises the girl's ambitions of being a fashion designer. However, the boy ends up unintentionally tearing off the back of the girl's designer gown-dress upon having slipped off a cherry ball on the floor which was being sqaushed by a man.  In comes another man, a fantastic character, Pinkesh, also nicknamed 'Pinku'. Initially a private detective, Pinku has had solved numerous cases, but the toughest case is that of Naari, since she is also one among his half-acquaintances. During the time when Dev was conversing on phone in the first scene, it was actually Pinku himself who was chasing Naari and also speaking to Dev. However, it is revealed that Pinku is also deeply infatuated with Naari, and has often supported her with cons. Also, it is unveiled that the person who tried to squash the cherry on the floor was also Pinku, who later chased Naari and found her, at last, with money belonging to her target. After a few more dozen moves, Naari left, leaving Pinku still undaunted. She later went to Dev's house to empty her belongings from the huge house.  Returning to Dev's life, the story shows him visiting the bank to mortgage another loan, but the bank is raided by robbers, and while dealing with a crisis, he meets Palak Mehra '''([[Gunjan Malhotra]])''', the same girl he was capturing on his camera, who defends him against a haughty woman trying to falsely accuse him. The two get out, Dev thanks Palak, and asks Pinku to meet up at Velvet Lounge, a starry restaurant. Meanwhile, Palak's friend also arrives there, asking her to meet up at Velvet Lounge.  At night in Velvet Lounge, Palak's friend refuses to turn up, while Pinku and Dev do meet, but Pinku makes up a fake pretext of using the washroom and leaves Dev in the lurch, and Dev doesn't have money to pay. Meanwhile, Palak too does not have money to pay. However, they meet each other in a funny manner, with Palak perceiving him as a chicken-bait and Dev perceiving her as Goddess Lakshmi. Both have a fat meal, but when it comes to payment, Dev tokens away his car keys and Palak her ring, which she wanted to wear off after her fiancé left her.  Dev and Palak walk on foot to Dev's house where she admires its scenic beauty. Palak asks to change her clothes and occupies Naari's room. Naari turns up at that moment, when Dev asks her to empty her room else he will throw away everything in her room. Palak returns, notices Naari and condemns her and soon takes a taxi.  It is further revealed that when Dev had phoned him to reach Velvet Lounge, Pinku was at Dev's house, hidden away in the bathroom since he was helping Naari procure her passport and bags before she could leave.  A rewind back to Pinku's escape from Velvet Lounge reveals the character who had been narrating the story all this time : Haryanvi Don Jassi Chaudhary '''([[Sharib Hashmi]])'''. It is revealed that while Pinku was chasing Naari in the five-star hotel, the latter was with Jassi. The same night when she ditched Dev, she met Jassi, who fell head over heels for her, and while he sang the lovebird songs, Naari eyed some lettuce which Jassi was supposed to give away to a local lord. A reformed gangster, Jassi, who, till then, was into a decent business, began suspecting Pinku of a false move and later discovered that it was he who had Naari escape.  Actually, it is further revealed that the money which Naari stole from Jassi comprised counterfeit notes, which she ferried in a bag. While Dev reached home with Palak that night, Naari hid herself behind a tree, and simultaneously, Jassi and his men also succeeded in spotting Naari. While she occupied Naari's room, Palak didn't literally freshen herself, but instead noticed the bag and unknowingly stuffed the cash bundles into her bag and purse, thinking she might get a government bank job for which her private banking firm demanded a bribe. Naari rushes into her room after Palak leaves, but is devastated to find her bag empty, where after, she notices Jassi, who forgives her and confesses his love for her. Naari realizes her mistake and reunites with Jassi. Meanwhile, Dev chases Palak, who is in a taxi, which is driven by Gurinder himself, and succeeds in earning her attention and affection. He starts dancing and an SUV car stops. He steps aside, the car leaves, and he starts dancing again, little knowing that Jassi and Naari were in the SUV.  Presently, Pinku, who was actually spared by Jassi's men whose entry into Velvet Lounge in his search offered Pinku the prerogative of escaping, is at Dev's house, lifting dumbbells and advising Dev against another rendezvous with Palak. While the two meet, they confess love for each other, and find hilariously that they had been running after fake bundles of cash!  The story returns to the same foreground in the beginning, where Dev and Palak have a one-on-one meet with the audience as a married couple. Jassi also stars here, revealing that Naari has now turned over a new leaf as a networking employee.  
Bad Night
 Kate (Lauren Elizabeth Luthringshausen) and Abby ([[Jenn McAllister]]) are heading to school for a field trip for their art history class that will award them extra credit if they attend. Right before Kate joins her classmates to wait for the school bus, she is informed by her parents that they are no longer able to pay for her college education due to another one of her father's failed investments, much to Kate's disappointment.  After a morning spent at an art museum, the class stops at a restaurant for lunch. Although Kate and Abby find the food served repulsive and sickening, their classmates willingly consume it. Kate and Abby decide to eat granola bars Abby brought instead of the served food. While the class is on its way to its next stop after leaving the restaurant, everyone on the bus except for Kate and Abby become nauseous due to the lunch they ate and start vomiting. The teacher, having also eaten the food, brings the class to a motel to spend the night and recover. As Kate and Abby are in the motel asking for rooms, Abby notices an envelope on the counter with the names Viceroy and Monarch written on them.  Meanwhile, Ari ([[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]]), gang leader and the owner of a nearby roller skating rink, meets with a driver known as Wheels (Owen Smith) and negotiates a deal. Wheels must drive the two art thieves Ari has hired, who go by the code names Viceroy and Monarch, to help them steal a painting that Ari plans to sell. In return, Wheels will receive a sum of money from the exchange. Wheels agrees to the deal, but on the condition that he will cut off all connections with Ari after this final job. Ari informs Wheels of the motel where the art thieves are to be picked up, which is revealed to be the same motel where Kate and Abby are staying.  Kate and Abby, bored with staying in their room, decide to sneak out of the motel to entertain themselves. To avoid identification, Kate names herself and Abby Viceroy and Monarch when ordering a ride. At the same time, the real Viceroy ([[Julianna Guill]]) and Monarch ([[Judy Marte]]) are preparing to leave the motel for their job to steal the painting Ari hired them to steal. Kate and Abby exit their rooms and find Wheels waiting in his car in the parking lot. With Wheels thinking that Kate and Abby are Viceroy and Monarch and Kate and Abby thinking that Wheels is their driver, Wheels lets them in and drives off while, unbeknownst to them, two of Ari's henchmen follow. Immediately after they leave, Brian, the driver Kate ordered, shows up and picks up the real Viceroy and Monarch.  Kate and Abby get Wheels to take them to a thrift store as their first stop, while Brian drops Viceroy and Monarch off at the painting's location. Viceroy and Monarch manage to obtain the painting and continue their operation as Kate and Abby continue their fun night out. They almost get caught by the police, but Monarch manages to take them down while Brian watches in surprise and tries to drive away. Viceroy and Monarch hold Brian at gunpoint and demand that he start talking. When Brian tells them that he is just a driver for a ride-share company, Viceroy and Monarch realize that they got into the wrong car and reveal to Brian that they are in fact undercover FBI agents. Meanwhile, as Kate and Abby are getting tattoos, Wheels realizes that they are not actually Viceroy and Monarch and tells them that they have to leave immediately, just as Ari calls his henchmen (who have been following Kate and Abby, thinking they are Viceroy and Monarch) and tells them to bring Viceroy and Monarch to him right away.  Wheels tries to help Kate and Abby escape, but the three encounter Ari's henchmen. Wheels tells Kate and Abby to run while he attempts to fight off the henchmen. However, despite their efforts to escape, Kate and Abby are captured and brought to Ari, who believes they are Viceroy and Monarch. While Abby attempts to explain that they are students, Kate lies and tells Ari that they are Viceroy and Monarch and they have what he wants. Ari holds Abby hostage and demands that Kate get the painting, threatening to kill Abby should she fail. Despite Abby's pleas for Kate to stay with her, Kate runs back to the motel to get help, where she meets the real Viceroy and Monarch, who have been going through the motel's security footage to find who took the ride meant for them.  With no other choice, Viceroy and Monarch get Kate to pose as Monarch (and gets Kate to pose Abby as Viceroy) and deliver the painting to Ari. As Ari waits for his buyer to arrive and authenticate the painting, Wheels (whose name he has already revealed as Andy) comes in and attempts to convince Ari that Kate and Abby are not Viceroy and Monarch. In response, Ari shows Wheels the painting Kate delivered to him, completely torpedoing Wheels' credibility. Ari's buyer comes and authenticates the painting, but just as she finishes, a clown under Ari's extortion arrives and initiates a shootout. In the ensuing gunfire, Viceroy and Monarch and take down Ari's henchmen and buyer. Ari prepares to shoot Kate and Abby for snitching, but Wheels tackles Ari before he does so. As the buyer tries to escape, Brian, who has been waiting outside, runs over her with his car. Viceroy and Monarch come in and meet Abby and Wheels for the first time, and reveal that they were working for an undercover unit specializing in recovering lost and stolen artwork.  The group destroys Brian's car to remove any stray links and Viceroy tells Kate and Abby to keep all events of the night confidential. Wheels takes Kate and Abby back to their motel and, to Kate's pleasant surprise, gives Kate a stack of cash to help with her college fund. Kate and Abby reunite with their class and continue their art history field trip.  
The Bad Education Movie
 The film opens with Alfie Wickers (Jack Whitehall) having taken Class K on a school trip to Amsterdam. Unbeknownst to him, Mitchell (Charlie Wernham) has spiked his crepe with magic mushrooms, causing Alfie to hallucinate while in the Anne Frank Museum. He believes Jing (Kae Alexander) is a panda and is convinced that the Anne Frank dummy is alive, which leads to him stealing it from the museum (in a parody of [[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]) and ends up in a canal.  One year later, Alfie plans to take his class to [[Las Vegas]], angering the PTA, who doubt the educational value of the trip. They demand that Alfie be sacked. Deputy Head and Alfie's father Martin Wickers (Harry Enfield), headmaster Shaquille Fra$er (Mathew Horne) and teacher and Alfie's girlfriend Rosie Gulliver (Sarah Solemani) insist that Alfie is given another chance and that they conduct a surprise visit to his classroom. Meanwhile, Mitchell has been attempting to tattoo 'Class K Forever' onto Alfie's back, but Alfie passes out from pain before Mitchell can get any further than the letters 'CLA'. The classroom visit ends with the children's parents refusing to pay for the Las Vegas trip. Alfie says he will pay for the trip, but upon realising the cost of this, decides on a trip to [[Cornwall]]. Joe (Ethan Lawrence) is concerned his overbearing mother Susan will not let him go on the trip, but Alfie creates a fake trip itinerary to fool the parents into thinking the trip is academical. Alfie also informs his class that his best friend from school, Atticus Hoye (Jeremy Irvine), is hosting a house party in Cornwall.  Susan, concerned about what the trip will involve, comes with the group to Cornwall,and implements Alfie's fake itinerary, starting with a trip to the [[Eden Project]]. While at the Eden Project, Mitchell picks a plant known as 'nature's laxative' which Alfie spikes her drink with. The class continue to Penleven Castle where they see John the Baptist's foreskin. Susan, beginning to feel the effects of the laxative, goes to the toilet and leaves the group unattended. While she is away, Mitchell attempts to steal the foreskin, but loses it instead. Alfie retrieves it, but is unable to put it back before Susan returns. Alfie is forced to eat the foreskin to cover his tracks.  The group then arrives at the fishing town of Port Jago, where their hotel is located. Alfie and the children manage to sneak out to the local pub without being caught by Susan. At the pub, the barman (Steve Speirs) and Pasco Trevelyan (Iain Glen) are discussing the Cornish Liberation Army, a terrorist organisation fighting for Cornish independence, which they are both members of. Alfie and the class arrive at the pub, where Alfie is mistaken for a CLA member because of the unfinished tattoo on his back. Pasco has a plan to assassinate the local MP, Michael Hoye, who is also Atticus' father. Overhearing Alfie talking to Joe about going to the party at Atticus' house, Pasco reveals himself to be a smuggler and recruits Alfie to the CLA. Alfie and the class become involved in the frivolities at the pub, which get out of hand and end up with Joe being stabbed in the hand. Susan records the incident from outside through a window, but before she can send the recording to the other parents, Pasco (at Alfie's request) slips her some sleeping pills, packs her in a trunk, and abandons the trunk in [[Cherbourg]], [[France]]. Pasco then takes the group to a strip club, where he asks Alfie to deliver some cannabis to Atticus Hoye's party the following evening on his behalf. Unbeknownst to Alfie, the truck he is to deliver the cannabis in is actually packed full of explosives. Meanwhile, Susan hitches a lift back to the UK from France with some illegal immigrants.   Back at school, the other teachers have lost contact with the Cornwall trip since Susan went missing. Martin, Fra$er, and Rosie drive down to Cornwall in an attempt to find them. Alfie and the children arrive at the party, where Alfie is bullied by his so-called friends and made to teabag a swan. Feeling betrayed by everyone, including his class, he decides to call Pasco to be picked up from the party. Pasco takes this as a signal and detonates the truck, which blows up in the grounds of the Hoye house. Pasco drives Alfie and the children in his truck back to Port Jago and decides to make Alfie the leader of the Cornish rebellion. They are joined by many of the people from the pub and Port Jago itself, who all reveal themselves to be members of the CLA. Meanwhile, the other teachers, trying to find Alfie, have involved the police, who believe the situation to be so serious they call in Interpol, who in turn conclude that Alfie has been radicalised. They are joined at the operation's nerve centre by Susan and some other parents.  Pasco informs the group that the CLA is going to seize the means of production, which in Cornwall's case is its most important tourist attraction. The police believe this to be the Eden Project, and send troops there, but it soon transpires that the group are actually heading to Penleven Castle again. Alfie sabotages the rebellion, but expresses sympathy for Pasco's cause. Pasco turns violent and imprisons them. While the children escape thanks to a secret passage Joe finds in the castle which leads down to the beach, Alfie is forced into a swordfight with Pasco. Rosie and Fra$er arrive in a helicopter and pull Alfie to safety, with Pasco being arrested.  The story then jumps to results day when Mitchell again mixes magic mushrooms in some brownies which he gave to Alfie. Alfie once again lost his senses and hallucinated, before posing for a very unusual 'Leavers Photograph'. It is also revealed in this scene that Michael Hoye has resigned as MP of Port Jago.

After the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the USSR]], university student Pavlichenko becomes a sniper in the [[25th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|25th Rifle Division]]. She fights in the [[Battle of Odessa (1941)|Battle of Odessa]] and, eventually, the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941–42)|defense of Sevastopol]]. After 309 confirmed kills, she is sent to the [[United States]] to campaign for American support. Eleanor Roosevelt invites her to the White House, and the two become friends.  In 1941, Lyudmila is a student who has just gotten into university; to celebrate, she goes to a shooting range with her friends including a classmate named Masha, doing exceptionally well despite never have shot before. At home, her father shows no pride in her, having desired a son who could become a soldier. In a twist of events, her perfect shooting results at the range eventually result in the military contacting her for a sharpshooting program, as Germany has just invaded the Soviet Union. Though a doctor courting her, Boris, tells her she should stay with him, she rejects what she perceives as cowardice and leaves to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].  During training, Lyudmila is shown as an excellent sniper, and eventually is partnered with a grizzled veteran named Makarov, who she falls in love with. He doesn't return her affections, however, and explains that he had lost his wife and family when the Germans invaded. She is also reunited with Masha, who is now a nurse engaged with a young pilot. During battle defending the city of Odessa, she is injured and Makarov drags her to safety to a local hospital, where Boris has volunteered as a military doctor. After awakening, Lyudmila manages to get Boris to sign her papers so that she can return to the frontlines, but finds out that Makarov has died in battle and the Soviets are retreating to Sevastopol.  She is paired with another superior, Leonid, and begins to show signs of trauma, showing signs of cruelty by shooting enemy soldiers to wound them and watch them suffer, rather than kill them instantly. Thus, their relationship starts off rough, but they eventually develop a close romance. Masha invites them to her wedding, but at the wedding reveals that her fiance had died, leaving her alone. This leads Lyudmila to tell Leonid privately that she wants a son.  While on patrol in a field, Leonid steps on a mine that triggers a [[flare]]. Immediately, artillery shells begin to pummel the field, and Leonid shelters her from them with his body. Lyudmila again wakes up in a hospital, where Boris tells her Leonid has died. Though in a broken state, she is ordered to kill a top enemy sniper for propaganda purposes. The duel takes all of a day, and, tired of waiting, Lyudmila steps out of cover, exposing herself completely. She is shot, but manages to pinpoint the enemy sniper's location and kills him.  Boris eventually is able to pull her away from battle. As the city is being evacuated, Boris carries a traumatized Lyudmila to a submarine that is evacuating the city. As panicked civilians attempt to board evacuating ships, Lyudmila realizes that Boris isn't coming with her, as he gave her his ticket. A voiceover by Eleanor Roosevelt reveals that Boris, Masha, and countless civilians and soldiers died defending the city from the Germans.  Roosevelt later visits Lyudmila after the war, where she is now a mother. They attend the opera together, with Lyudmila's son.  
Batman vs. Robin
 During an investigation of missing children, [[Damian Wayne]], (the current Robin, [[Batman]]'s son by [[Talia al Ghul]]), has taken the [[Batmobile]] out to an abandoned toy factory without Batman's consent. He finds the perpetrator, [[Dollmaker (comics)#Anton Schott|Anton Schott]], who has mutated some of the victims into dolls. Batman arrives, and in the resulting battle, Robin chases Schott while Batman knocks out the dolls with gas and frees the remaining children. Upon defeating Schott, Robin chooses to spare him, but an owl-masked assassin named [[Court of Owls#The Talons|Talon]] suddenly kills Schott and frames Robin for the murder. Batman is eventually convinced of Robin's innocence after finding an owl feather at the crime scene.  The next night, Bruce Wayne (Batman's alter ego) has dinner at Wayne Manor with fellow wealthy socialite Samantha Vanaver, who meets Damian. Later, he tries to connect with Damian, but he voices his frustration towards Bruce for never trusting him. Bruce goes out, leaving Damian with [[Dick Grayson#Nightwing|Nightwing]] to look after him (and calling off his date with Starfire in the process) and starts to investigate the owl feather, which leads him to the Gotham Museum of Natural History's Hall of Owls. He is reminded of a childhood story about the [[Court of Owls]], a secret society of wealthy men who ruled Gotham from the shadows and killed any who opposed them by sending agents called talons. On the night his parents were murdered, Bruce had seen an owl clutching a bat flying away from the crime scene. He became convinced that the Court of Owls was to blame, but after finding no evidence of their existence, Bruce dismissed the legend.  While continuing to investigate, Batman is attacked and nearly killed by three undead, owl-masked assailants. After killing one, Batman continues to fight, receiving many wounds in the process. At the end of the fight, Batman lies defeated and watches as the two remaining assailants prepare to kill him, only for them to suddenly liquefy into black ooze. Meanwhile, Damian, having escaped Nightwing and fled the mansion, is approached by Talon, who encourages Robin's choice of punishing criminals and offers Robin a chance to join him. Unsure of the decision, Robin returns home, where Bruce discovers him and warns him that he will be sent away to a school in Switzerland unless he learns to discipline himself.  While driving to a date with Samantha, Bruce is kidnapped by white owl-masked people and he is brought before the Court of Owls, who offer Bruce a chance to join them. After Bruce leaves, given time to consider the offer, Talon reveals himself to be working for the Court of Owls, who are secretly raising an army of inhuman, undead talons to destroy Gotham City and allow the Court to rebuild it in their own image. However, their current talons are imperfect and dissolve after a period of time. It's also revealed that Talon's in a romantic relationship with Samantha, who's secretly the Grandmaster of the Court of Owls. While the Court is planning for Talon to become one of their undead soldiers, with Robin serving as Talon's replacement, Samantha's secretly planning to save Talon from this procedure and have him become a member of the Court, so he can rule Gotham by her side.  Damian, having contacted Talon, starts accompanying him to take out criminals, though he hesitates to kill them, which frustrates Talon. Sensing how Robin looks up to Batman as a father, Talon explains that after he gave his abusive thief father up to the police, who shot him, Talon was recruited by the Court of Owls. Batman shows up, having tracked Robin's activity, but is blocked by Robin from capturing Talon. Batman tries to convince Robin that Talon and the Court of Owls are using him, but Robin is unconvinced, believing Batman is trying to hold him back from his potential. A confrontation breaks out between them, with Robin nearly getting the chance to kill Batman before leaving.  Batman sneaks into the Court of Owls's headquarters through the sewers, but is exposed to psychotropic gas by the Court, causing Batman to hallucinate. He is rescued by Nightwing and [[Alfred Pennyworth]]. Meanwhile, Talon introduces Robin to the Court and the Grandmaster. When Damian reveals himself to her, Samantha deduces that Batman is Bruce. When ordered to kill Damian, Talon instead turns against and overthrows the Court and kills every single member, including Samantha. Now in control of the Court's army of talons, Talon leaves Damian behind, offering him another chance to join him once he has killed Batman.  Talon and his soldiers attack Wayne Manor, breaking into the Batcave as Batman, Nightwing, and Alfred fight them off. Batman and Talon battle each other. Talon gains the upper hand until Robin, who escaped from the Court's headquarters, intervenes and fights in Batman's place. He eventually defeats Talon and holds a sai to his throat. However, Talon commits suicide by forcing Robin's sai through his own neck, leaving Robin stunned and confused.  Batman tries to welcome Robin back home, but Robin refuses, claiming he needs to sort out who he is. He leaves for a monastery in the Himalayas that Batman suggested to him.  
Batman Unlimited: Animal Instincts
  
Baskin (film)
   The film opens with a boy waking from sleep in the middle of the night. He walks to a closed door across the hall from his bedroom and overhears the sound of a woman having sex, which suddenly stops. He walks to the living room, where the television is playing static. He turns off the television and notices a red light emanating from his bedroom. He becomes afraid and runs to the closed door, yelling for his mother. A robed arm reaches towards him from his bedroom. The door slams.  The film cuts to a deserted parking lot at night where a police van is parked. A hooded figure, presumably the same one from the opening sequence walks towards a building carrying a bucket full of bloody meat. The building is revealed to be a restaurant, where the only customers are five [[police officer]]s, who are sitting at a table discussing bets on the Spanish Primera Division. A young man brings dirty plates to wash in the back of the restaurant, when he hears knocking at the back door. He opens the door, and is given the bloody meat bucket without exchanging words. It is handed to the chef, who begins cutting the meat.  One of the police officers, Seyfi, sits away from the table, nursing a headache. The other officers start talking about their sexual experiences, as the chef starts cooking the meat. One officer, Apo, implies that he [[Zoophilia|lost his virginity to a chicken]]. The rookie, Arda, states that he lost his virginity at a brothel. Another officer, Yavuz, tells a story about his sexual experience with a prostitute who he claims looked like a [[Victoria’s Secret]] model, who turned out to be a transvestite. Amidst Yavuz and the other officers laughing and joking about the story, the young man brings food to the table. Suddenly, Yavuz asks the young man why he is laughing, and accuses him of calling him gay. The chef enters and defends him, saying that he is only a boy. As they argue, Seyfi runs to the restroom to vomit in the sink. The police decide to leave, but the young man says, “If only you weren’t cops” as they exit. Yavuz turns and resumes arguing. Remzi, the officer in charge, has the chef step aside and challenges Yavuz to back up his words by hitting the young man. They fight, and Yavuz easily wins. In the restroom, Seyfi notices a frog sitting where the soap should be and brushes it off. As he does,  the hooded figure is revealed in the mirror, standing behind him. Suddenly, he starts screaming. The officers rush to him and prepare to shoot the restroom door lock before it opens on its own.  Arda and Yavuz have a cigarette as Ado tells them that Seyfi had said that he briefly felt like he was losing his mind, and that Remzi had helped to talk him down. Ado says that Seyfi has never had this kind of incident before. Seyfi and Remzi come out to the parking lot. Seyfi convinces the others to let him drive. As they drive, they receive a radio call asking for backup, is somewhere called Inceagac. Seyfi reveals that he has heard bad rumors about the place. As they continue driving, Seyfi sees a naked man run across the road in front of them. They stop the van and get out, calling towards the surrounding woods for the man to show himself. As they do, something unseen jolts the van behind them. Arda notices strange symbols suddenly carved into the side of the van. The officers then notice a mass of frogs that has appeared behind the van. They get back in and resume driving. The officers start asking Seyfi what he really saw, and he insists that it was a man. As they argue, they fail to notice a bloody person standing in the middle of the road, who the van hits, then swerves and crashes into a shallow stream.  The film cuts back to the restaurant, where Remzi and Arda sit at a table, while Yavuz and Apo watch television, and Seyfi sits holding his head. Arda tells a story about a dream he had as a child, where his friend appears to him in a dream, telling him not to be afraid. Earlier that same night, the two of them had made a promise that, whoever died first, he would appear to the other and tell him not to be afraid. Arda says that he woke up, but was still in a dream. He then describes the opening scene of the movie, revealing that the boy in it was him. However, he does not describe the hand reaching for him, but instead states that his fear came from knowing that his friend was in his room waiting. He states that the next day, [[Precognition|he found out that his friend truly had died that night]]. He states that this is a recurring dream that he continues to have to this day, and that he had never told anyone else about it. We learn that, a year after that night, his parents died in a car accident, and his uncle placed him in Remzi’s care. Remzi then tells Arda something he wishes he had told him when they first met. He asks Arda to focus, taking in all his surroundings. Arda suddenly sees the hooded figure standing in the shadows behind Remzi, who tells him that this is the first time someone else has been able to see it. As in the dream, a hand reaches out. Black liquid starts leaking from the ceiling and seeping from the floor, and Arda falls backwards in his chair. Instead of hitting the floor, he falls into a dark body of water. As he floats underwater, a giant pair of hands reaches down towards him from the surface.   The film cuts to Arda being pulled from the water by the other officers. A strange group of people have gathered by the stream around a fire. One of them begins laughing, asking if the officers were in an accident. Yavuz demands to know why he is laughing, and angrily kicks over a bucket, which is full of frogs. The officers go to find the person they hit, but the body has disappeared. Seyfi and Apo notice blood coming from each other’s head. They note that their radios and phones are broken, presumably from the water. They ask the strangers where they are, and are told that they are in Inceagac. They get one of the strangers to lead them to a building where an empty police car is parked outside, with its lights flashing. He tells them that it was a police station back in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman days]], and a stable when he was a child, but that is now deserted and avoided. Seyfi states that he had heard about the place, and echoes that it was a police station in the Ottoman days. As they prepare to enter the building, Remzi pointedly tells Arda not to worry, and that he has the key to all of this. Small ornaments crafted with twigs, some vaguely human-shaped, hang from a nearby branch. Seyfi tries to call out using the radio in the car, but it doesn’t work. The stranger takes the opportunity to run away, cursing at them as he does.   The officers enter the building. Inside, another strange ornament hangs from the ceiling in the middle of a hallway. There are more around, and they appear to be twine wrapped around some kind of flesh and/or bones. They find egg shells that seem filled with blood. Apo vomits. They go on to find a man in a police uniform standing and hitting his head against a wall. He doesn’t respond to their questions, except to point to a stairwell when they ask where his partner is. Arda, Remzi, Yavuz, and Apo go down the stairs, while Sefyi stays with the man they found. Seyfi notices a frog, which jumps away from him. He follows it to a room where he finds naked person covered in blood, with chains around their wrists apparently having intercourse with another bloody person with a black plastic bag over their head. Seyfi looks around and sees several more similarly-adorned people in the room, and as he panics, they attack him, forcing him to the ground. The man in the police uniform starts laughing in the hallway.  The other officers find a room with chains hanging from the ceiling, decorated with similar ornaments to before, with blood and grotesque drawings on the walls. There is a table in the middle with lit candles around several padlocks. Apo notices another room where bloody bodies wrapped in clear plastic are hanging from the ceiling, and others wrapped in chains around black plastic line the walls. There is also a cage with a blood-covered woman inside. Meanwhile, Arda follows a streak of blood on the floor to a different room, where he sees dozens of bodies wrapped in blood-stained sheets on the floor and hanging from the ceiling. On one side of the room, a woman with a butcher knife is cutting up a body and throwing entrails into a bucket. To their right appears to be people copulating behind a hanging plastic sheet. As he realizes what he is seeing, Arda begins trembling in fear. In the other room, Apo reaches out towards the woman in the cage, while behind him, one of the bodies by the wall begins to move, then hits him over the head with a sledgehammer. He falls to the ground unconscious. Yavuz sees this and starts screaming, and runs away. The yelling is heard by Arda, and also the people in the room with him, who are revealed to be blindfolded. We see that one of the people behind the plastic sheet is hanging from the ceiling, and has had both legs cut off, at the waist and above the knee, respectively. The people run towards Arda, who panics and shoots wildly at the walls and ceiling as he runs away. Remzi, Arda, and Yavuz run down a hallway, pursued by the blindfolded people who pursue them on all fours. Yavuz falls down and is dragged away. As Adra keeps running, Remzi disappears from behind him. The walls are suddenly made of stone bricks and the floor is dirt. Suddenly Remzi finds himself in his childhood house, just outside his bedroom. He sees his childhood self pulled into the room by the robed arm from the opening dream sequence.  The film jumps back to the restaurant, where Arda is choking on water from a glass. Remzi tells him that they have a long way to go. Arda asks what is going on. Remzi’s answer is vague. He tells Arda that not everything has a clear answer, but that tonight they are at a crossroads. He says that they were summoned there tonight, and there was no call for backup. He says that someone is looking for something, and this has been happening to Arda ever since he was a child. Arda wakes up chained to a stone pillar. Remzi, Yavuz, and Apo are chained to their own pillars. In the middle of the room, a mass of blindfolded, blood-covered people crawl and kneel, reaching up towards a spiral staircase. A man with one eye uncovered walks around them. He claps, and they fall silent and still. The hooded figure slowly descends the staircase, and the blindfolded people reach out to him reverently as he passes. Yavuz curses at him. He removes his hood and washes his hands and his disfigured head, then laughs at Yavuz. He tells the officers that he is only there to help them, on a night where doors open and realms unite. He tells them that Hell is not a destination, but something they carry inside them, and that he is there to shepherd and guide them.  The disfigured man (Baba) walks to Apo, who seems half-conscious. He opens Apo’s shirt, revealing a line of crude stitches across his belly, with several inches of intestine protruding from the end. He pulls at this, tearing open the stitches, then slowly pulls out Apo’s [[small intestine]] as the other officers scream for him to stop. Apo is unchained, collapses to the ground, and is pulled away by the bloody mob of people. Baba disrobes, revealing a large padlock hanging in the middle of his back, and a necklace of padlocks across his chest. He then walks to Yavuz and places a stool in front of him. He is short enough that, even when standing on the stool, his face is barely level with Yavuz’s. He asks for Yavuz’s name, who tearfully tells him after initially refusing. He tells Yavuz that he seems tough, and that the human soul worships power. He is handed a small knife. Remzi yells for Yavuz to close his eyes, and he does. The man asks Yavuz if he is ready to stop worshipping power and give up his worldly eyes to see what is beyond. The man repeatedly asks Yavuz to open his mind, as he begs him to stop. Finally, Baba says, “Yavuz,” and he opens his eyes for a moment, only to have the knife gouge them out. Baba licks the bloody knife and Yavuz’s eye sockets. A blindfold is wrapped around his head. Baba kisses Yavuz on the forehead and tells him not to disappoint him. The one-eyed man opens a door and leads a chained woman, crawling on all fours with a goat’s skull attached to her face, into the room. Yavuz is positioned behind her and has sex with her. He orgasms, then the woman crawls away and collapses. Baba approaches Yavuz and tells him that his heart and mind are still not open. Yavuz says “no” repeatedly as he has a seizure, then collapses. A large spider crawls out of his mouth, as Rezmi and Arda scream. The one-eyed man picks up the spider and places it into a drawer.  Baba says that maybe the honor belongs to Arda, before placing the stool in front of him. Remzi yells at him to stop, and to take him instead. Baba does not respond, and places his forehead against Arda’s while mumbling strange words. Arda squeezes his eyes shut. Baba licks his knife, and then his finger, which he uses to dab blood onto Arda’s forehead. He says he wasn’t wrong about Arda. Baba then places the stool in front of Remzi. He says that he was only expecting Remzi, then thanks him for raising Arda and bringing him along. He then cuts open Remzi’s throat as Arda screams. Baba washes himself in Remzi’s blood as it spurts from his neck. He goes back to Arda and grabs his head, placing their foreheads together again, and Arda has visions of the road and the abandoned building, cast in a red light. Meanwhile, the woman with the goat skull squats over a basin, and a rock resembling a fetus drops down from her.  Arda finds himself in the restaurant again. Instead of sitting across the table, Remzi is now laying on the floor, with this throat slashed. He tells Arda that he made a promise to protect him. Baba approaches them from the doorway. Remzi tells Arda that he has only one key in this life, and that it belongs to Arda now. Arda reaches into Remzi’s neck wound and pulls out a key. Baba is now next to him, saying “Everything ends, but everything starts anew.” Arda takes the key and plunges it into the keyhole-shaped tattoo on Baba’s forehead. He falls to the ground, in the dungeon. Arda picks up the stool and beats Baba to death with it, covering himself in blood. He walks past the mass of blindfolded people and ascends the spiral staircase. He exits the building, cast in a red light as in his vision. He walks with a strange limp, pausing to laugh maniacally. He exits the woods and starts jogging down the middle of an abandoned road. He is then hit by the police van in the exact same sequence shown earlier in the film. Notably, all of the police officers, including Arda, are shown in the van, suggesting that Arda is caught in a [[time loop]]. The film closes on the now-empty police van, sitting abandoned in the stream.

Beasts of No Nation (film)
 The village is informed that the government has fallen, with military-aligned rebels seizing control of the country. With rebel forces headed towards the village, many people flee to the country's capital for safety. Agu's father is able to buy safe transport for his wife and two youngest children, but has to stay behind himself with Agu and his eldest son. Rebel and government forces fight in and around Agu's village. While the rebel soldiers flee, Agu and his family, along with other villagers, are captured and accused of being rebels, with Agu’s father and brother being killed. Agu escapes and evades capture. He is then found by a rebel group and their Commandant and is brought to their camp. After undergoing a brutal initiation process, Agu becomes a fully-fledged member of the militia.  Agu befriends another young NDF [[child soldier]], Strika, who never speaks. One night, the commandant summons Agu to his quarters, and rapes him. Strika, another of the commandant's rape victims, comforts him. Preacher, an older soldier, gives Agu [[brown-brown]] to lift his mood. Agu and Strika take part in a number of bloody battles and ambushes. The battalion's success in the taking of several towns, killing hundreds of men, women and children, gains them a summons to the rebel HQ, where the commandant, accompanied by Agu, Strika, and a few other members of the battalion, go to meet with the NDF leader. They spend an entire night in the waiting area, infuriating the commandant. When they finally meet the supreme commander, he informs the commandant that he is not being promoted, as he had expected, and is in fact being removed from command and that his lieutenant will be the new commander of the battalion.  The commandant has the lieutenant killed that night and he takes his men and flees telling them it is time that they "line their own pockets and get theirs."  As they wander through the jungles, Strika is mortally wounded from air strike missiles alongside others who lost their lives. Flash forward in time and Agu is at a new fort with the troops. The commandant's lieutenant will need gold to pay for supplies. Ammunition runs out, leaving the group with no way to defend themselves from encroaching enemy forces. Agu informs the commandant of this, and he tells Agu that he must take care of him, as all sons must protect their fathers. As they speak, Preacher, now the new lieutenant, rallies the soldiers to abandon their posts and surrender to the UN, as they will surely starve or be killed if they stay. The commandant at first refuses to let them go, but relents when Agu says they should surrender. The soldiers all depart, leaving the raving commandant alone. Shortly after, they are detained by UN troops. The younger members of the battalion are sent to a missionary school in a safe part of the country. Agu stays away from the other children, who play games and enjoy the comfort and safety of the school. Agu is tormented by what has happened, and has nightmares about it.  After much time has passed, Agu tells the school's counselor that he has done some terrible things but he won't go into detail. He is afraid the counselor will think he is some kind of "beast." Instead he tells how he used to be a good boy, from a good family, and that his family had loved him. The final scene shows Agu finally joining the other boys as they swim and play in the ocean.

Beeba Boys
 Jeet Johar, is a ruthless Indo-Canadian gangster living in Vancouver, B.C. He and his gang take on the ironic name of "Beeba" (which means good) boys and dress in stylish colourful suits. Jeet is irreverent, picking a feud with the much older Robbie Grewal, who deals in drugs and weapon smuggling. He shoots Lucky, a man who works for Grewal, for selling drugs on his turf. As a result, Jeet is arrested and forced to stand trial for Lucky's murder.  While in prison Jeet meets Nep, a failed wannabe kidnapper who ingratiates himself to Jeet by beating up some white supremacists. Jeet also becomes attracted to a blonde juror serving on his trial. He is eventually declared not guilty of the crime of Lucky's murder. Out of prison he introduces himself to Katya Drobot, the blonde juror, and immediately installs her in a penthouse in a hotel he owns. He also has his crew contact Nep and tells him that in order to gain his favour he must do something to anger Grewal. Unsure of what to do Nep contacts Grewal, whom he is secretly working for, planning to double-cross Jeet. Grewal suggests that Nep kidnap his daughter, Choti. Choti goes along with the plan, Jeet is impressed and Nep officially becomes a Beeba Boy.  For a while things run smoothly, however Jeet becomes cocky and hijacks some of Grewal's merchandise and then attempts to kill Grewal. Nep, aware of the plan, is able to warn Grewal in time to save his life. However this casts suspicion that there is a mole inside Jeet's roster. Manny, one of Jeet's Beeba Boys, takes Nep with him to shake down one of Grewal's men. The man easily gives up Nep as the mole but then shoots Manny and lights him on fire. As Jeet is trying to figure out how members of his gang keep being murdered Katya inadvertently reveals that Nep was with Manny when he died. Jeet takes Nep for a drive, intending to kill him, but they are pulled over by the police and Nep takes the blame for Jeet's illegal gun.  More and more men from Jeet's organization are murdered. They retaliate by killing more of Grewal's men, but both parties end up wounded. The apartment where Katya is staying is eventually raided, as it is unprotected, and Katya is murdered. Unsure of what to do Jeet listens to his mother's suggestion that perhaps it would be best for the family to return to India.  Before going Jeet asks Nep to meet him at a nightclub. Nep goes to the club and the two have a conversation where Nep reveals that he was in fact not working for Grewal but was part of an undercover sting operation to take down Grewal who then asked him to go undercover to take down Jeet to prove his loyalty.

Belle & Sebastian: The Adventure Continues
  In the French Alps village of Saint-Martin, during the year 1945, Sébastien (a nine-year-old orphan) lives with César, his adoptive "grandfather". They await César's daughter Angélina, who, having fought with the Resistance until the end of the war, is coming home by plane. On the journey, Angélina's plane crashes in the Italian Alps, apparently with no survivors. César breaks the news to Sébastien, who refuses to accept she has perished.  César arranges for a local cantankerous pilot Pierre to make a fly-by of the crash site. César tells Sébastien that Pierre is probably his real father. Sébastien and Belle sneak on board Pierre's plane for the fly-by and see a flare lit near the crash site which Pierre does not. They argue and Sébastien grabs the joystick, causing the plane to land awkwardly and lose a wheel. The three of them are stranded in the mountains.  Sébastien and Belle start to walk towards the crash site in search of Angélina. Pierre eventually catches up with them, finding Sébastien has set up a camp and is quite confident in the forest. On the way they rescue Gabriele from a bear attack. She is a 14-year-old girl masquerading as a boy, because she is the only girl in an all-male Italian logging camp and her father fears for her safety. Another experienced hiker, she befriends Sébastien and leads them to the logging camp.  Sébastien again tries to escape to look for Angélina at the base of the cliffs, but is recaptured and locked up at the camp, while Belle follows a trail to the cliffs and eventually returns to camp. Pierre is still not convinced Angélina is alive, and angry with Sébastien for consistently disobeying him, but because by now he knows Sébastien may be his son, they have a rapprochement.  The camp awakes in the morning to find a bushfire threatening in strong winds, but Sébastien, Belle and Gabriele have left with supplies, again to follow Belle to where Angélina may be. They are caught by the bushfire and Pierre, again following them, saves them by extinguishing the fire with a stick of dynamite. They walk to the cliff base and enter a cave, following Belle. There is no sign of Angélina on the cave floor, but Sébastien is lowered by rope to a lower cave, where he finds Angélina, who had fallen to this lower level. She appears harmed but (in a major flaw of the plot) gets up with only a damaged arm, and is winched back to safety by Pierre and Gabriele. By now, the bushfire threatens the cave mouth so Belle leads them up a back exit to the top of the cliffs, and they narrowly escape asphyxiation.  They are next seen at the aircraft, which has been repaired with the aid of the Italian loggers and Gabriele's father. They all fly back to France, passing over César and Pierre's mechanic, who had walked together for two days to reach the crash site (the mechanic complaining about the arduous nature of the journey). César joyfully turns back for home, having seen a hand waving from the plane.  The final scenes see César arriving at his house in Saint-Martin; he embraces Angélina, as she emerges from hanging out the washing. Sébastien and Pierre sit at the grave of Sébastien's dead mother, who was carrying him at the time of her death in the first movie. It emerges Pierre loved her, but she was a Romany gypsy woman, so their affair was secret from everybody, particularly the male gypsy siblings. Pierre did not know she was pregnant at the time of her death. He had searched for her for months without success, after his own release from German prison camp. It then pans to a shot of the alpine valley in summer.

Bhaunri - The Sinking Reality
 {{ external media | align  = right | width  =  | video1 =  | video2 =  }}  The word "bhaunri" means "the whirlpool". Whirlpool is the force that never allows any object to stay afloat. Whatever comes close to the whirlpool has to sink. A nation does not mean the lines drawn on a map. A nation is composed of its citizen and its social, political and spiritual principles, laid down by the wisdom (or lack thereof) of the nation builders. The story of ''Bhaunri'' reveals how those principles are used to exploit marginalized people in the state of Odisha.  The story revolves around Nandu, son of a bonded tribal laborer who never saw the value of schooling for his son.  Dibakar, a social worker with an ideology combining leftism and pragmatism, helps Nandu get into school, but the immorality of his teacher drives Nandu from the educational system. The film flashes forward to the present, where Nandu has become a bonded cowboy at a young age. Nandu’s family is paid Rs.10/- per day in exchange for his labor.  Saraba is like a brother to Nandu. He grows with his simple curious lies. Nandu meets a girl called Janha and there is love at first sight between them. In the meantime Nandu’s father falls ill and due to lack of medical facilities the old man becomes paralyzed and bedridden. The local capitalist Jitu is a depicted as a villain. He exploits people wherever possible. He becomes attracted to Janha and one day tries to molest her, but gets beaten up by Nandu. Jitu has strong political connections. The line officers of that area are controlled by Jitu. Though the political bodies of the area are reserved for the tribal people, Jitu gets his sycophants elected every time. The power stays with him. Nandu gets married to Janha. On the first night of their marriage, Nandu’s house is set on fire by Jitu’s men. Janha stands by Nandu’s side to start fresh. Nandu and Janha attempt to rebuild the house. From this their miseries start again, as the police arrest Nandu on false charges. Meanwhile, Nandu’s father dies. From the funeral Nandu escapes with Janha. Before the police can kill Nandu and Janha, they are rescued by the armed Maoists. Dibakar is the leader of that group. Nandu and Janha’s frustrations drive then to become members of the banned organization. Janha is eventually caught by the police and is sent to the local jail. Nandu kills Jitu as the organization thinks that Jitu is the police informer responsible for Janha’s    arrest. Then Dibakar plans an attack on the jail to loot weapons and rescue imprisoned cadres, including Janha. In that operation Janha is shot in the crossfire and, unable to get timely medical attention, dies, with her last breath revealing that she was pregnant. Nandu realizes that the gun can only kill. It can’t build a new society; the film concludes with Nandu turning his attention to the figure of Mahatma Gandhi, the preacher of truth and non-violence.

 After their daughter Hazel turns 18, Dee's ex-husband threatens to cut off child support unless Hazel will get treatment for her crippling agoraphobia.  Forced to take a van ride to the treatment center, Hazel struggles to enter the van.  Though they have clashed over Dee's hard-living lifestyle and Hazel's neuroses, Hazel is comforted when her mother offers to come with her.  To accommodate Hazel's fears, the treatment center allows her to travel in a box, where Hazel will be able to isolate herself from others and her environment.  While traveling through the desert, half-brothers Pru and Jesse attack the van to kidnap a wealthy heiress.  Pru, mentally damaged from head trauma by his abusive mother, reacts erratically and shoots Dee.  Although exasperated by the unnecessary violence, Jesse cleans up the scene of the crime by shooting everyone else but the heiress and Hazel, who remains hidden in her box.  After Pru and Jesse leave, Hazel checks the others and finds her mother wounded but still alive.  A map reveals a nearby reservation, which Hazel offers to travel to for help after applying first aid to Dee.  After Hazel leaves, Dee finds a note written by Hazel that lists all the reasons why Hazel believes her mother to hate her.  Hazel slowly makes her way through the desert, forcing herself to concentrate on simple goals, such as reaching one cactus after another.  Her pill-taking ritual is disturbed by the dusty weather, and she must abandon some of her pills when they become too dirty for her to put in her mouth.  She hallucinates the ghost of her dead sister, who she was unable to save in a drowning accident.  When Jesse learns from an inside contact that one of the patients is agoraphobic, he realizes that it could not have been Dee, whom he initially assumed was a patient.  When he and Pru return to the van, they discover Hazel's empty box, and Jesse leaves to find her.  Dee, who has located a pistol in the van, takes Pru hostage.  Meanwhile, Hazel runs into a junkie named Clete who quotes [[Aldous Huxley]].  Hazel eventually convinces Clete to help her, but his promised motorcycle turns out to have been disassembled.  Despairing and not sure whether to further trust Clete as he begins to rant about women, Hazel pulls out pepper spray.  Clete grabs it from her and in his craze pepper sprays himself, Hazel starts walking backwards away from him, trips on a rock and bumps her head.  When Hazel wakes, she has been rescued by a kindly couple who found her just outside the reservation.  They contact the police for her and offer to take her back to her mother.  On the trip, they meet a representative of the treatment center, who says he was dispatched to locate the missing van.  He convinces Hazel to allow him to pick up her mother and bring them to the treatment center.  Despite the representative's protestations, the kindly couple follow behind him, reasoning that they can help protect her with their rifles.  All converge on Dee's location at approximately the same time, where she is still holding Pru at gunpoint.  Jesse, revealed to be the local sheriff, attempts to take control of the situation, but Dee warns the others not to trust him.  The representative attempts to parlay with Dee, but when he makes a move to attack her, the couple opens fire, killing him, Jesse, and Pru.  Hazel rescues the kidnapped heiress and tearfully reconciles with her mother.  
The Big Short (film)
 The film consists of three separate but concurrent stories, loosely connected by their actions in the years leading up to the [[Financial crisis of 2007-2008|2007 housing market crash]].  '''Michael Burry'''  In 2005, eccentric [[hedge fund]] manager [[Michael Burry]] discovers that the United States [[housing market]] is [[Economic bubble|extremely unstable]], being based on high-risk [[Subprime lending|subprime loans]]. Anticipating the market's collapse in Q2 2007, as interest rates would rise from [[adjustable-rate mortgages]], he proposes to create a [[credit default swap]] market, allowing him to bet against market-based [[mortgage backed securities|mortgage-backed securities]], for profit.  His long-term bet, exceeding $1 billion, is accepted by major investment and commercial banks, but as it requires paying substantial monthly [[Insurance|premiums]], it sparks his clients' vocal unhappiness, believing he is "wasting" [[Capital asset|capital]]. Many demand that he reverse and sell, but Burry refuses. Under pressure, he eventually restricts withdrawals, angering investors. Eventually, [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|the market collapses]] and his fund's value increases by 489% with an overall profit of over $2.69 billion.  '''Front Point Partners and Jared Vennett'''  [[Deutsche Bank]] salesman Jared Vennett is one of the first to understand Burry's analysis, learning from one of the bankers who sold Burry an early credit default swap. Using his [[quantitative analyst|quant]] to verify that Burry is likely correct, he decides to enter, earning a fee on selling the swaps to firms who'll profit when the underlying bonds fail. A misplaced phone call alerts Front Point hedge fund manager [[Steve Eisman|Mark Baum]], who is convinced to buy swaps from Vennett due to his own personal distaste with the banks. Vennett explains that the packaging of subprime loans into [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs) large enough to be considered [[Bond credit rating#Credit rating tiers|AAA ratings]] will guarantee the eventual collapse.  Baum's staff investigates the [[Miami]] market, discovering that [[mortgage broker]]s are profiting by selling risky mortgages to [[Wall Street]] banks, creating the bubble. In early 2007, as these loans begin to default, CDO prices somehow rise and ratings agencies refuse to downgrade the bond ratings. Baum discovers [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] and [[Credit rating agencies and the subprime crisis|dishonesty amongst the credit rating agencies]] from an acquaintance at [[Standard & Poor's]]. Baum's employees question Vennett's motives, yet he maintains his position and invites Baum and company to the [[Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association|American Securitization Forum]] in [[Las Vegas]]. Interviewed by Baum, CDO manager Wing Chau, on behalf of an investment bank, describes how [[synthetic CDO]]s create chains of increasingly large bets on faulty loans – up to 20 times as much money as the loans themselves. Baum horrifyingly realizes that the fraud will completely collapse the global economy. He purchases as much as possible, profiting at the banks' expense and waits until the last minute to sell. Baum's fund reaches $1 billion, and he laments that the banks won't accept blame for the crisis.  '''Brownfield Capital'''  Young investors Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley accidentally discover a [[Prospectus (finance)|prospectus]] by Vennett, convincing them to invest in swaps, as it fits their strategy of buying cheap insurance with big potential payouts. Below the capital threshold for an [[ISDA Master Agreement]] required to enter into trades like Burry's and Baum's, they enlist the aid of retired [[Security (finance)|securities]] trader Ben Rickert. When the bond values and CDOs rise despite defaults, Geller suspects the banks of committing fraud. The trio also visit the Forum, learning that the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] has no regulations to monitor mortgage-backed security activity. They successfully make even more profit than other hedge funds by shorting the higher-rated AA mortgage securities, as they were considered highly stable and carried a much higher payout ratio.  Geller and Shipley are initially ecstatic, but Rickert is disgusted, citing the impending collapse and its effects; when unemployment goes up 1%, 40,000 people will die. Furthermore, they realize the banks and the ratings agency are maintaining the value of their CDOs in order to sell and short them before the inevitable crash. Horrified, they try to tip off the press and their families about the upcoming disaster and the rampant fraud but nobody believes them. As the market starts collapsing, Ben, on vacation in England, sells their swaps. Ultimately, they make a profit of $80 million, with their faith in the system broken.  '''Epilogue'''  Jared Vennett makes $47 million selling off the swaps. Mark Baum becomes more gracious from the financial fallout, and his staff continues to operate their fund. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley go their separate ways after failing to sue the ratings agencies, with Charlie moving to [[Charlotte]] to start a family, and Jamie still running the fund. Ben Rickert returns to his peaceful retirement. Michael Burry closes his fund after public backlash and multiple IRS [[audits]], now only investing in water commodities. It is noted that as of 2015, banks are selling CDOs again under a new label: A "[[Bespoke portfolio (CDO)|Bespoke Tranche Opportunity]]".

A Bigger Splash (2015 film)
 In an isolated villa on the small Italian island of [[Pantelleria]], world-famous rock singer Marianne Lane is on holiday with her filmmaker lover Paul. She is recovering from surgery and has lost her voice, communicating only by signs and occasional whispers. He is in recovery from alcohol addiction and a failed suicide attempt. Neither speaks Italian but solitude is what both need, until an aeroplane from Rome brings a man neither wants to see.  This is Harry, an extroverted music promoter who was Marianne's lover until he passed her on to his protegé, Paul. With him is Penelope (Pen), a previously unknown daughter of his who says she is 22. Moving into the villa, Harry starts inviting friends around as if it were his home and taking everybody out to various sights and festivities. His arrogant manner bores Pen and annoys Paul, but Marianne starts falling under his spell again; however, when Harry and Marianne begin to become intimate while alone, Marianne stops Harry. She tells him that she does love him, but that she cannot be with him and that she is with Paul. The sultry Pen then makes a play for the unhappy Paul; it is not shown, but implied, that Paul succumbs to Pen's overtures.  After drinking on his own, Harry comes back very late and starts a fight beside the pool with Paul. Both fall in, and the fight continues. Paul holds Harry underwater too long, and Harry drowns. Realizing his mistake, Paul pulls Harry to the surface and attempts to resuscitate him, but is unsuccessful and leaves Harry to drift to the bottom of the pool. In the morning his corpse is seen by the maid, who calls the police. They have more urgent business with illegal immigrants landing from North Africa, some floating ashore dead, but take the occupants of the villa in for questioning. Marianne convinces them with the truth that she was asleep, and suggests that the murderer was an intruder. Paul lies, saying he went to bed before the time of death, and is believed. Pen reveals that she can speak perfect Italian, but chose to let her hosts struggle, and her passport reveals that she is only 17. Paul is concerned that Pen may have witnessed his fight with Harry in the pool, but is unable to determine how much she knows, if anything. Paul tearfully admits to Marianne that he killed Harry but tried to save him. Taking her to the airport, at the departure gate, Pen makes a statement which references something Marianne once said to Harry. Visibly disturbed, Marianne slaps Pen. Pen maintains her composure until she is shown boarding the plane in tears unseen by Marianne and Paul who depart in their car. On the ride back to the villa, they are stopped by the police. It is the investigating officer, but rather than pursuing the case he reveals himself to be a fan of Marianne and wants her to autograph a CD. She obliges and returns to the car where she and Paul share their relief and drive away.  
Bill (2015 film)
 ''Bill'' is set during Shakespeare's [[Shakespeare's life#Lost years|"lost years"]]—the crucial period, long a mystery to scholars, covering his rise from obscurity in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] to fame as a playwright in [[London]]. According to the official synopsis, the film will tell the "real story" of what happens when "hopeless lute player Bill Shakespeare leaves his family and home to follow his dream. It’s a tale of murderous kings, spies, lost loves, and a plot to blow up [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]." <ref name="BBCpr"></ref> Writer Rickard further explained that this "very different" version of the future Bard has already tried "everything from contemporary dance to playing lute in a band. He's never found his calling."<ref name="emp2ndlook"></ref>

Birdboy: The Forgotten Children
 The island home of the cast of [[funny animal|talking animals]] was once a fishing community with a pristine environment.  [[Bird|Birdman]], the father of Birdboy, tended the lighthouse that guided the fishing boats.  Then a [[Factory|factory]] was built and many islanders went to work there.  But one day, the factory exploded, devastating much of the island and killing all the fish.  The destroyed part of the island became a landfill.  After the explosion, Birdman began flying around the island mysteriously, carrying a satchel.  The police came to believe that he was [[Illegal drug trade|trafficking drugs]], and they eventually shot him dead, but his satchel actually contained strange glowing golden acorns.  The explosion leaves a [[Demon|demon]] trapped inside Birdboy, leading him to live alone.  Birdboy controls the demon by using drugs that he buys from Zachariah, a [[Pig|piglet]] who owns a fishing boat and a parrot, and "happy pills" that a [[Mouse|mouse]] named Dinky steals from her parents.  The young mouse in fact becomes very close friends with Birdboy, but he pushes her away because of the demon inside him.  The police hunt after Birdboy, thinking that he might be pushing drugs as well, and shoot him in many instances.  But each time he's shot, Birdboy retreats to a secret [[Grotto|grotto]].  Thriving with life, the grotto contains a giant tree surrounded by clean water that still has fish.  Birdboy has filled the tree with birds; when they die, their souls take the form of bright yellow bugs that can heal Birdboy's wounds.  The bugs then retreat to the tree, causing it to grow the golden acorns.  Dinky lives with her mother and stepfather, [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalists]] that routinely excoriate her for her misbehavior.  One day, she decides to finally go through with a plan to escape the island.  She and her friends Sandra the [[Rabbit|rabbit]] and [[Fox|Little Fox]] have been saving coins to pay for a trip to the city, where they heard Little White Mouse's older brother went and prospered.  To get the last amount of money they need, they decide to rob Zachariah's house.  Zachariah has also been saving money to escape, but stays to care for his drug addicted mother.  Her addiction takes the form of a vicious [[Spider|spider]] demon that grows to gigantic size whenever Zachariah injects the drugs.  The spider catches the children stealing Zachariah's piggy bank, but the kids get away with the bank after a fight that leaves the spider weakened.  Finally fed up with the spider, Zachariah crushes it, even though he knows killing the spider will kill his mother.  But his mother actually thanks Zachariah for freeing her; trying to comfort her tearful son with her last words.  Dinky, Sandra and Little Fox make their way to the landfill, where they find Little White Mouse's brother still there, scavenging copper for money.  The brother leads them to the contraband dealer Uncle Klauss.  The kids hope to get a boat on which to leave the island, but they can only afford a large inflatable pool toy duck.  Continuing through the landfill, the kids get ambushed by a tribe of scavenger rats known as the Forgotten Children.  Zachariah's parrot sees the capture, and flies to Birdboy to warn him that the Forgotten Children plan to execute the kids.  Filled with rage, Birdboy allows the demon to take over, turning him into gigantic, fire breathing raptor.  In this form, Birdboy decimates the Forgotten Children and destroys their settlement.    Once freed, Dinky searches for Birdboy and finds her scared friend reverted back to his normal form.  Dinky pleads with Birdboy to come with them, and finally tells him that she loves him.  Overjoyed, Birdboy agrees to guide the kids on the inflatable duck from the air.  But a storm capsizes the toy duck, and then the police spot Birdboy and shoot him one last time.  Zachariah uses his fishing boat to rescue the kids, but he then returns them to their homes.  Later on,  Zachariah tries to fish again, only to salvage a dying Birdboy from the ocean's bottom.  Birdboy's own glowing bug emerges from his dying breath.  The bug gathers many other bugs, and they fly to Dinky's room.  The bugs lead her to Birdboy's grotto, where she finds the golden acorns that may someday revive the island.

Black Mass (film)
 In 1975, [[Whitey Bulger|James "Whitey" Bulger]], leader of the [[Winter Hill Gang]], controls most organized crime within [[South Boston]], along with his right-hand man [[Stephen Flemmi]], newcomer [[Kevin Weeks]], and callous hitman [[Johnny Martorano]]. Bulger lives with his [[Common-law marriage|common-law wife]] Lindsey Cyr and their young son Douglas.  Bulger's supremacy is challenged by the [[North End, Boston|North End]] [[Angiulo Brothers]], a rival gang that is part of the [[Patriarca crime family|New England Mafia family]]. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent [[John Connolly (FBI)|John Connolly]] returns to the area – he grew up in South Boston as a friend of Whitey and his brother [[William M. Bulger|William "Billy" Bulger]], the [[Massachusetts Senate]] [[President of the Massachusetts Senate|President]]. Connolly tries infiltrating the Angiulo Brothers and attempts to get Whitey to work with the FBI. Although Whitey hates the idea of being [[Informant|a rat]], he understands the protection he would have for himself, his gang, and his family. Douglas suffers from [[Reye syndrome]], leading a devastated Lindsey to remove him from life support over Whitey's furious objections. When the Angiulo Brothers murder a Winter Hill member, Whitey becomes an informant.  Although Connolly is supported by his co-worker John Morris, their boss, Charles McGuire, is suspicious. Whitey increasingly exploits the FBI informant relationship, using Connolly's "protection" as a cover for his crimes. Connolly demands information on the Angiulos' [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]] locations. Finally, Whitey gets pictures of the rival gang's hideouts, allowing the FBI to [[Telephone tapping|wiretap]] the Angiulos. The FBI arrests them, thus eliminating underground opposition to Whitey's power. Connolly, blinded by his past, grows closer to Whitey and the gang, even inviting them to his house for a cookout. His wife, Marianne, sees negative changes in her husband as his agent-informant relationship with Whitey grows.  Cut out of an [[embezzlement]] scheme from World Jai Alai, Whitey orders Martorano to murder his rivals [[Roger Wheeler (businessman)|Roger Wheeler]] and John Callahan. An associate, Brian Halloran, goes to the FBI to report Whitey's involvement, much to Connolly's displeasure, who then tells Whitey of Halloran's accusation, thereby resulting in the murders of Halloran and an unnamed accomplice. Following the passing of his mother, Whitey's behavior becomes increasingly violent and unpredictable, deteriorating his informant relationship.  A "bulldog" [[prosecutor]], Fred Wyshak, is appointed the new assistant [[United States Attorney|U. S. Attorney]] in Boston. Connolly attempts to make friends and to perhaps divert his attention from Bulger, but Wyshak bluntly refuses, demanding that the FBI arrest Whitey. John McIntyre, an informant within the Winter Hill Gang, informs on an attempt by Whitey to smuggle weapons for the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]]. Connolly tells Whitey, who murders McIntyre. Wyshak and McGuire investigate Connolly's management of Whitey's informant role. They discover that most of what Connolly called Whitey's tips were already obtained from other sources. Morris, disillusioned and fearing prosecution for his association with Connolly's activities, anonymously divulges Connolly's and Whitey's relationship to the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' and a front-page story exposes the FBI's links to organised crime.  In the final scenes, Connolly, Flemmi, Weeks, and Martorano are arrested. Whitey goes on the run, but not before giving Billy a final goodbye from a pay phone. Morris [[turn state's evidence|turns state's evidence]] and testifies against Connolly in return for [[legal immunity|immunity]]. Connolly's and the other characters' sentences are listed, and a concluding sequence shows a now-elderly Whitey being caught by the FBI in 2011.  
Blackhat (film)
 At a nuclear plant in [[Chai Wan]], [[Hong Kong]], a hacker causes the coolant pumps to overheat and explode. Not long after in [[Chicago]], the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange|Mercantile Trade Exchange]] gets hacked, causing soy futures to rise. The [[Government of China|Chinese government]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] determine that the hack was caused by a [[Remote Access Tool]] (RAT). An army officer in China's [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) cyber warfare unit, Captain Chen Dawai ([[Leehom Wang]]), is tasked to find the people responsible for the attacks, and enlists the aid of his sister Chen Lien ([[Tang Wei]]), a hacking engineer. He meets with FBI Special Agent Carol Barrett ([[Viola Davis]]) in [[Los Angeles]] and reveals the code in the RAT was written by himself and Nicholas Hathaway ([[Chris Hemsworth]]), his brilliant college roommate, in their school days at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], years before Hathaway was sent to prison for an unrelated hack. Dawai asks that the FBI arrange for Hathaway to be released from prison, where he is serving a sentence for computer crimes. Hathaway is offered a temporary release in exchange for his services.  He negotiates a deal with the U.S. government to have his prison sentence commuted as time served if his assistance aids in the apprehension of the hacker. However, he must wear an ankle bracelet and be monitored by a Deputy [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] named Jessup ([[Holt McCallany]]).  Hathaway identifies the criminal who aided the hacker in his penetration of the Exchange's computer servers and develops a romantic relationship with Lien. Clues uncovered by Captain Chen and Special Agent Barrett next lead the team to Hong Kong where the team works with Police Inspector Alex Trang ([[Andy On]]). Hathaway manipulates the update system on the Marshal's phone GPS that tracks his location, so he can follow his own lead and arranges a meet with the hacker's partner to a restaurant. While they are waiting, he tells Lien about his past, but the hacker's partner never shows. Hathaway discovers a camera watching them and messages the hacker on the restaurant's computer that he is on his trail now. A gang arrives, but Hathaway defeats them as if it were a prison fight. Meanwhile, the team traces the stock trade money to a known paramilitary operative named Elias Kassar ([[Ritchie Coster]]). Hathaway, Jessup, Chen, and Trang, along with a [[Special Duties Unit]] team, raid Kassar's hideout. A shootout ensues and Trang as well as a number of SDU officers are killed as Kassar's men are armed with superior firepower and explosives, allowing them to escape by boat.  Meanwhile, the nuclear plant has stabilized enough to retrieve a data drive from the control room but it is corrupted. The [[National Security Agency|NSA]]'s Black Widow software has the power to repair the data, but the U.S. does not want the Chinese using it. Hathaway goes rogue and successfully hacks into the NSA to use Black Widow, discovering that the hacker's server is based in [[Jakarta]]. Lien finds out the hacker has been buying high-resolution satellite photos of a site near [[Seri Manjung]], [[Malaysia]].  Hathaway's hack into the NSA does not go unnoticed and the U.S. government, NSA and FBI demand his return to prison. Dawai's superiors advise him to proceed the investigation without Hathaway. Outside, one of Kassar's men secretly plants a tracking device on Dawai's car. Dawai, Lien and Hathaway manage to elude them but Hathaway argues with Lien about the danger of them staying together, when they are ambushed by Kassar and his men. Dawai is killed as are Barrett and Jessup, who arrive on the scene. Lien and Hathaway barely escape into the subway. Lien uses her connections to acquire a plane to go after Kassar.  Mourning Dawai's death, Hathaway and Lien travel to Malaysia out of revenge to figure out the hacker's goal. After discovering a set of tin mines, Hathaway realizes that the hacker's attack at the nuclear plant was merely a test for a later plan to sabotage a large dam with huge spill ways to destroy several major tin mines that are down stream in Malaysia, allowing the hacker to make a fortune trading tin futures. The two travel to Jakarta and hack into the bank's computer to successfully drain the hacker's bank accounts, forcing the hacker, Sadak ([[Yorick van Wageningen]]), to respond. Sadak and Hathaway agree to become partners. Hathaway knows that the meeting will be a trap and arms himself with makeshift weapons and body armor, using his prison knowledge. He conceals the weapons under a loose fitting jacket.  Hathaway insists Sadak and Kassar come alone but they bring their henchmen. Lien spots them and alerts Hathaway, who orders them to a new location at nightfall, a crowded parade in a large park. Hathaway trails Sadak and Kassar from behind. Kassar draws a machine pistol on Hathaway as he approaches. As Kassar is frisking Hathaway, he is overpowered and fatally stabbed with a screwdriver. Two of Sadak's men catch up and a firefight ensues, wounding Hathaway despite the armor, who manages to kill both men with the pistol. Hathaway is stabbed by Sadak, but manages to kill him. He regroups with Lien's help, and she gives him medical attention. The film ends with Lien and Hathaway leaving [[Indonesia]], with Sadak's money still in their bank account, although they are now fugitives at large.

The Blackcoat's Daughter
 In February, at a prestigious Catholic boarding school in upstate New York, students are preparing to be picked up by their parents for break. Kat (Shipka), a freshman, has a dream where her father shows her the horribly smashed family car. She awakens from the dream, and marks off her calendar, looking forward to the day her parents will come. An older student, Rose (Boynton), worries she might be pregnant and intends to tell her boyfriend that night.  When both Kat and Rose's parents fail to pick them up before break, Rose confesses she told them the wrong date, but does not disclose it is because she wants to delay them until she can tell her boyfriend about the pregnancy. Mr. Gordon, the headmaster, jokes that their parents will eventually show up since they cannot live there forever. Kat is visibly upset, and the two nuns who are acting as chaperones reassure her that everything is fine and promise to keep calling her parents. They ask Rose to watch over Kat that night.  That night Rose tells Kat that she is going out. When Kat protests, Rose tries to unnerve her by telling her a story about the nuns at the school being [[Theistic Satanism|devil worshipers]]. She leaves Kat alone and gets in the car with her boyfriend. Kat hears a payphone ringing in the hall and picks up.  Meanwhile, a girl named Joan (Roberts) gets off a bus in upstate New York and cleans herself up in the bus station bathroom. She has a flashback of a psych ward and tears a hospital bracelet off her wrist. She attempts to make a call on a payphone, but the number she calls has been disconnected. As she waits outside for the next bus, she is noticed by a man named Bill (Remar), who offers her a ride, much to the chagrin of his wife, Linda (Holly). Joan notices a bouquet of flowers in the back seat.  Once dropped back at the school by her boyfriend, Rose goes to the bathroom and hears strange noises coming from the boiler room, and goes to investigate. When she looks through a window in the door, she sees Kat prostrate in front of the lit boiler.  Joan awakens in a hotel room. She takes a shower and a bullet scar can be seen on her shoulder. In a flashback, a police officer shoots a rifle. Bill knocks and tells Joan the reason he picked her up is because she reminds him of someone. He invites her to have dinner with him at the restaurant next door, where he shows Joan a picture of Rose, who is revealed to be his daughter. He explains she died nine years ago. Joan excuses herself and goes to the bathroom, where she giggles and has a memory of killing a woman and stealing her identification card. Joan sees Bill talking to a cop and steals a knife from a bus tray. Bill tells her they have to hit the road to beat an impending storm, and Joan goes to the car where Linda is waiting. Linda tells Joan that Bill sees Rose in every young girl but that she does not see Rose in Joan at all.  Rose tucks Kat in and tries to reassure her that her parents are on their way. Kat tells Rose she knows her parents are dead, which disturbs Rose. Rose goes back to her room and bars her door with a chair. Rose awakens and goes to breakfast with the two chaperones and Kat. Kat begins to act strangely and is unable to pray. When one of the chaperones begins to scold her, Kat stands up and vomits. As they try to nurse her, she lashes out at them. Mr. Gordon rings to tell them he will be coming back to the school.  Kat's parents are implied to have indeed died in a car crash. The women ask Rose to shovel the driveway for him.

Bloed, zweet & tranen
 The movie focuses on three stages in Hazes' life and are shown in no particular order.  *As an 8-year-old, Hazes is ordered by his aggressive father Joop to sing in pubs and at markets. Joop uses the collected money to buy his drinks and even forces his son to drink beer. One day the famous [[John Kraaijkamp Sr.]] hears André singing at the [[Albert Cuyp Market]]. He tries to convince Joop to have André on national television. Joop is not impressed; he thinks that his other son sings much better, until he finds out about the financial benefits. The performance is a success and subsequently Hazes records two duets with Kraaijkamp (''Droomschip'' and ''Juanita'') for single-release; it makes no impact. *As an adult, Hazes runs a pub and builds up a reputation as "singing bartender". He enjoys his first chart-hit with ''Eenzame kerst'' (''Lonely Christmas'') which is distributed by [[Philips Records]]. When Hazes ends this collaboration, [[EMI Music|EMI]] sends [[Tim Griek]] - one of their producers - to the pub to convince Hazes to join them. Hazes initlally declines because he's expected to sing [[levenslied]] (Dutch sentimental songs about everyday life) instead of his beloved blues; but he changes his mind when Griek convinces him that the time is not right to record a blues album (that would happen in the late 1980s). Hazes becomes close friends with Griek although they have their tensions which are often caused by Hazes' excessive drinking alcohol abuse. The friendship temporarily ends when Hazes reveals that he has an affair with a fifteen-year-old girl called [[Rachel Hazes|Rachel]]. Soon afterwards Griek gets involved in a car accident and drowns in the nearby river. *In his final stage Hazes prepares for his farewell performance in [[Amsterdam Arena]] which is scheduled for September 27, 2004. This is not an easy task because of his addiction to alcohol (mainly [[Heineken International|Heineken]]) and cigarettes (mainly [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]]); he also suffers from deafness and diabetes. A few weeks before this final performance he even had to stop his show as he was too drunk; his health deteriorates. On September 21, 2004 a sick Hazes falls into coma whilst dreaming about his performance in Amsterdam Arena. He passes away two days later.

Blind Date (2015 film)
 A shy woman ([[Mélanie Bernier]]) moves into her new apartment in Paris, helped by her sister Charlotte (Lilou Fogli).  She longs to be a professional pianist and has just moved out of the house of her piano teacher, Evguenie (Grégoire Oestermann). On her first night, she hears strange noises and a picture on her wall begins to move. Fearing a supernatural presence, she flees to Evguenie's house. As a teacher, Evguenie is harsh and critical, encouraging poise and technical perfection over emotion. She returns to her flat the next day and realises that the noises are caused by her neighbour — a quiet and reclusive man ([[Clovis Cornillac]]), who barely ventures outside and whose only friend is the slovenly, kind Artus ([[Philippe Duquesne]]). He explains that the wall separating their apartments is hollow and that any noise made in either place can be heard. Not wanting to be disturbed, he moves the picture to scare new tenants away from the flat, thus leaving him in peace. The woman refuses to be driven away by his behaviour.  The two live side-by-side, irritating one another with increasingly inventive noisy behaviour. Eventually, their mutual wind-up ends when the woman amplifies a metronome, and the man cannot bear it any more. When she is practising Chopin's Revolutionary Etude, the man finally speaks to her. He says that her playing lacks emotion, encourages her to let go of her self-consciousness, and to play the piece with real feeling. She follows his instructions, and the two become friends, talking to one another from either side of the wall. The man nicknames her 'Machine' ('Whosit') and the woman nicknames him 'Machin' ('Whatsit'). They become fond of one another but decide that they should never meet face-to-face. However, they decide to 'date' — even 'introducing' each other to Artus and Charlotte from either side of the wall.  In preparation for a competition, Machine invites Evguenie to her home for a final lesson. She explains to Machin that Evguenie can be unkind and asks him not to intervene. However, Machin, angered by the way that Evguenie bullies and belittles Machine, ejects Evguenie from the house. Machine is furious and decides that their relationship cannot continue. Machin asks to see her in person, but she refuses. Machin leaves the apartment and talks to Artus about his feelings for her. Artus encourages him to see her in person and suggests that he go to her audition to support her.  The day of the audition arrives, and Charlotte and Artus — unbeknownst to one another — sit in the auditorium to listen. Machine begins to play a piece by Mendelssohn, but there is a disturbance from behind the wall at the back of the stage. It is revealed that Machin was listening from behind the wall, but he has been discovered by an employee, causing the commotion. The judges, unimpressed by her wooden performance, do not want to give her a chance to start again.  Realising that Machin has ventured outside to hear her playing, Machine insists. She plays the Chopin instead, with great emotion. This performance impresses the judges. After the performance, Artus and Charlotte realise the other's identities and are immediately attracted to one another. Evguenie comments disdainfully on her performance. Angered by his continued negativity, Machine head-butts him. She returns to her apartment and confesses to Machin that she wished that she could have seen him after the performance — and that she wishes they could be together in reality. To her surprise, Machin knocks through the wall to her apartment, and they finally see each other for the first time.

Spooked by the sound of approaching horses, they hide in the hills and encounter a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] burial site. Buddy is killed by an arrow, and Purvis escapes.  Eleven days later, Purvis arrives in the small town of Bright Hope and buries his stolen belongings. Chicory ([[Richard Jenkins]]), the town's backup deputy, spots him and reports to Sheriff Franklin Hunt ([[Kurt Russell]]). At the town's saloon, Hunt confronts Purvis. When asked his name, Purvis hesitates before giving the name "Buddy" in an attempt to hide his identity. Sheriff Hunt shoots Purvis in the leg when he tries to escape. Hunt sends John Brooder ([[Matthew Fox]]), a local educated man and known womanizer who witnesses the shooting, to fetch the town's doctor. Meanwhile, foreman Arthur O'Dwyer ([[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]]) rests at home with a broken leg. His wife Samantha ([[Lili Simmons]]), the doctor's assistant, tends to his wound. As the doctor is drunk, Brooder calls Samantha and escorts her to the jail to treat Purvis's wound. Leaving Samantha with Purvis and his deputy Nick, Hunt and the others return home. That night, at a stable house, a stable boy is murdered by unseen attackers.  The murder is reported to Hunt, who investigates the scene and finds the horses missing. The jail is empty and only an arrow is left behind. Hunt sends for a local Native American man, whom he calls "the professor", to examine the arrow, and informs Arthur of the news. At the saloon, the "professor" links the arrow to a [[Cave dweller|troglodyte]] clan. He tells Hunt of the clan's dwelling place, "Valley of the Starving Men", and warns him that they are a group of [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] savages. Certain that Samantha, Nick and Purvis had been captured by them, Hunt prepares to go after them with Arthur. Chicory and Brooder volunteer to accompany them.  Days into their ride, two strangers stumble across their camp. Fearing they are scouts for a raid, Brooder kills them and they set up a cold camp elsewhere to avoid being attacked. During the night, a group of raiders ambush them, injure Brooder's horse and steal the rest. Brooder, wounded by an attacker, regretfully puts down his horse. After a day of walking, a fight breaks out between Brooder and Arthur, exacerbating Arthur's broken leg. Chicory sets his leg and leaves him behind to recover, while he, Hunt, and Brooder move on.  At the valley, the three men are injured by a volley of arrows. After killing two attackers, Hunt and Chicory retreat, leaving Brooder, who is seriously injured and demands to be left behind. Brooder kills one attacker before being killed himself. The attackers capture Hunt and Chicory, and imprison them in their cave. The men find Samantha, and an injured Nick, imprisoned in a nearby cage. They inform Hunt that the tribesmen have already killed and eaten Purvis. They witness Nick removed from his cell, stripped, brutally [[Scalping|scalped]], and [[Dismemberment|bisected alive]], then consumed. Samantha estimates the number of hostile cannibals to be around twelve (reduced to nine earlier by Hunt's posse).  Hunt realizes he has some [[Laudanum|opium tincture]] he confiscated from Arthur earlier to prevent him from overusing it. They lure several tribesmen to drink it, however only one drinks a fatal dose, and only one becomes unconscious. Meanwhile, Arthur wakes up, follows the men's trail and discovers the valley. He kills two tribesmen and notices an object embedded in their windpipes. After cutting one out, he realizes it is like a whistle. He blows on it, luring another tribesman close, then kills him.  In the cave, realizing two of their men were poisoned, the leader grows angry. He and another tribesman pull Hunt from his cell, cut open his abdomen and shove the hot opium flask into the wound. The leader then takes Hunt's rifle and shoots him in the arm and abdomen. Arthur arrives and kills one of the tribesmen, while Hunt kills the leader with one of the tribe's bone tomahawks. Arthur frees Samantha and Chicory, while a mortally wounded Hunt stays behind with his rifle. He prepares to kill the surviving cannibals when they return, to prevent them from terrorizing Bright Hope. As the three leave the cave, they see two pregnant females, who are blinded and have all their limbs amputated.  On their journey out, Arthur blows the tribesman's whistle, and with no response they continue to exit. At a distance from the cave, they hear three gunshots, implying that Sheriff Hunt had killed the remaining males of the tribe. Chicory acknowledges the gunshots with a half-hearted smile.  Tired, hurt, and with few supplies, the three begin the journey towards home.

Bound to Vengeance
 The movie begins with a man (who later turns out to be the kidnapper, Phil - Richard Tyson) driving his van to an abandoned house in a remote area. He cooks a meal and brings it to the basement, where a girl (Eve - Tina Ivlev) is being held captive, with her leg chained to the floor. Without him noticing, she pulls out a brick and hits him violently on the head. She searches for the keys, unlocks the chain holding her leg and uses it to chain his leg.  She rushes out of the house, just to find out she’s completely stranded in the middle of nowhere, with no one to ask for help. She can’t start the van because she doesn’t have the van keys. After finding out a phone inside the house, she tries to call the police, but it doesn’t work. While searching for the van keys, she discovers a revolver and a folder containing photos of some girls, along with their names (even her own photo). She quickly learns that she’s not the only victim of Phil.  She takes a bath, puts on Phil’s clothes before getting back to the basement. She holds the revolver at Phil, asking him where the other girls are. He dares her to kill him, telling her that he’s the only one that knows their whereabouts; if she kills him, she will kill them too (he informs her that there are 4 other girls in total). He also makes a deal with her: he shows her the girls, she brings him to the hospital. She goes upstairs, makes a snare, puts it around his neck and leads him to the van, forcing him to take her to the closest victim: a black girl named Nina.  Eve finds Nina at the first house, but when she finishes unlocking the chain holding Nina’s leg, she rushes out of the house in a hysterical fear - despite Eve’s explanation that she’s trying to help her. Nina trips over a water hose and falls onto a metal fence, which impales her neck and kills her.  Eve makes Phil drive to the next house, where she finds Laura - the second victim - in a room chained to the ceiling. He frees her, but right then, he tells Laura that Eve is about to take her place. Laura angrily beats Eve, giving him the chance to get the snare out of his neck. Eve shoots Laura dead in self-defense and shoots his leg before he can attack her. She beats him with a wooden bar before taking him to the van. He taunts her that she caused the death of those victims (Nina, Laura, and Dylan - another victim girl who appears in the flashback footage with Eve at an amusement park. It is later revealed that Dylan is Eve’s sister; she was held captive in the same basement with Eve, and she was dead). She ties him up with duct tape and drives to the next house.  She gets in the house alone and finds Lea (Bianca Malinowski) - the third victim - chained in a dark room. Right then, two men - one fat and one skinny - get in the house and go upstairs, ready to rape Lea. Eve recognizes the skinny one to be the rapist that sexually attacked her before. Eve shoots both of them, killing the fat guy immediately and leaving the skinny guy bleeding to death.  Lea accompanies Eve to the next location: an abandoned warehouse. They find some girls inside a locked room. They tell Eve and Lea that the kidnappers brought them there, they couldn’t but wait for those men to take them away. Eve leaves Lea at the warehouse, telling her to keep an eye on the girls and call the police. When she returns to the van, she finds Phil sitting in the front seat. He distracts her when a tall guy (presumably the captor of the girls in the warehouse) sneaks behind her, then grabs her and subdues her. When she wakes up, Phil is holding her tight, telling the tall guy to shoot her leg, like she did to him before. But at that very moment, Lea appears and hits the tall guy on the head with a spanner, killing him. Eve beats Phil for tricking her. Lea then stays at the warehouse when Eve goes with Phil to the final house.  She gets in the house to find no one but her boyfriend Ronnie (who also appears in the flashback footage with Eve and Dylan) sleeping on an armchair. Panic-stricken, she holds the revolver at him and interrogates him why he’s there (because it’s not his house), and why Phil knows his name (Phil keeps calling Ronnie’s name on the way to the houses). He concocts a story that the police didn’t help him to find Eve, and in the desperate attempt to look for her, he lost his job. He tries to calm her down, but she suddenly hears a noise at the closet and she takes him there. Eve spots the photos of the victim girls in a folder, but Ronnie again lies to her that on the way searching for her, he found and rescued many girls, except her. She orders him open the closet door and turn on the light. To her horror, she finds Katrina - the last victim - lying inside. Eve now realizes that her boyfriend and Phil are behind all of the kidnappings, including hers. In the van, Phil cuts the duct tape holding his hands, but before he can start the van to get away, he hears gunshots and sees the light flashing inside the house several times, suggesting that Eve shoots Ronnie dead. At that time, the police arrive at the warehouse and free all captive girls there, including Lea.  Eve leaves the house, shoots the van in a frenzy of rage, before telling Phil that they will go to the “final address”, where it turns out to be Phil’s house (a flashback reveals that she asks Ronnie for Phil's address before finishing him off). Afraid that his wife and daughter may find out his true colors, he pleads with her not to go there, but this bears no fruit. She throws him in front of his house. His wife is terrified to find her husband severely beaten. She quickly brings him into the house, but before his daughter closes the door, a hand (Eve’s hand) holds it open, implying that she comes back to exact her revenge on Phil. What really happened to him and his family remains unknown.  The movie ends with the satisfied Eve walking away, then standing on the street, with a cold and murderous look on her bloody face.  
The Boy Next Door (film)
 Claire Peterson ([[Jennifer Lopez]]) separates from her husband Garrett ([[John Corbett]]), after he was caught cheating with his secretary. Her colleague and best friend Vicky Lansing ([[Kristin Chenoweth]]) urges Claire to divorce. 19-year-old Noah Sandborn ([[Ryan Guzman]]) moves in next door to help his  uncle, who uses a wheelchair. They learn that there was a car accident in Noah's family last year, and now he's an orphan. Noah befriends Kevin ([[Ian Nelson (actor, born 1995)|Ian Nelson]]), Claire's teenage son, and begins attending his school, where Claire teaches English literature. Noah is drawn to Claire, expressing love for [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. With Kevin and Garrett away on a fishing trip, Noah catches Claire watching him change clothes through her window.  Claire goes on a miserable double date with Vicky and her boyfriend Ethan ([[Travis Schuldt]]), and his ill-mannered friend Benny ([[Bailey Chase]]). With Kevin still away, Noah calls Claire over to help him cook. She ends up having dinner with him, during which he unashamedly flirts with her. Despite Claire's hesitation, she lets Noah seduce her and they have sex. Claire tells Noah that she regrets their night together, causing him to punch a wall in rage. The school year begins, with Noah joining an uncomfortable Claire's class after hacking into her computer, making it appear as if she had requested this. Noah manipulates Kevin into hating his father, causing him to lash out at Garrett. Later, Kevin overexerts himself at gym class and goes into shock; Noah saves his life by injecting him with Kevin's [[Epinephrine autoinjector|EpiPen]]. Claire receives flowers from Noah, and she confronts him about it. Noah witnesses Claire and Garrett together at home after going on a date, which escalates his obsession with her.  After an incident where Noah—in defense of Kevin—slams a bully's ([[Adam Hicks]]) head into a locker repeatedly, Vicky, who is vice principal at the school, discovers that Noah was kicked out of his previous school for disorderly conduct. After Noah insults her, she expels him. During the fall fling, Claire goes to investigate a leak in the boys' bathroom, where she sees the words "''I fucked Claire Peterson''" written on the wall before Noah emerges. He attempts to force himself on her, but she fends him off and demands that he stay away from her and Kevin. The following day, Noah leaves a printer running in Claire's classroom, with pictures of them sleeping together scattered everywhere. Later, when Garrett's car brakes fail to work, he and Kevin are nearly involved in an accident. Noah blackmails Claire, telling her that he has a video of them having sex, which he will relinquish to her if she continues sleeping with him. She refuses, and has Vicky lure Noah away from his house so she can break in and delete their [[sex tape]]. While there, she finds pictures of herself all over the walls and on his laptop; she also finds instructions on how to tamper with the brakes of Garrett's car and Noah's parents' car.  Noah binds and gags Vicky with duct tape and uses a recording of her voice to lure Claire to her house. When Claire arrives, she discovers Vicky dead, her throat slashed by Noah. A horrified Claire contacts the police, but runs into Noah again. She accuses him of killing his parents, and he says his mother killed herself after his father cheated on her, so he caused the accident which killed his father and his mistress. Noah takes Claire to a barn house where he has tied up Garrett and Kevin, threatening to kill them unless Claire stays with him. A violent altercation occurs as Claire attempts to free them. Noah pours kerosene around the barn, causing it to ignite in flames. Garrett frees himself and attempts to choke Noah with a rope, prompting Noah to shoot him in the chest. Claire stabs Noah's eye with Kevin's EpiPen. Noah removes the EpiPen from his eye and blindly attempts to strangle Claire to death. When he holds Kevin at gunpoint, she pulls a lever that drops an engine on Noah, killing him. Claire and Kevin then help a wounded Garrett exit the burning barn house as police and paramedics arrive.  
The Boy and the Beast
 Nine-year-old Ren has recently lost his dead mother.  With no news of his father and refusing to live with his legal guardians, Ren flees into the streets of [[Shibuya]]. Ren steals some food and sleeps in an alley, reminiscing the aftermath of his mother's funeral.  In the Beast Kingdom, the lord has decided he will retire in order to reincarnate as a deity and names two potential successors: the popular Iōzen, who is also the father of two children, and the powerful Kumatetsu, who is lonely and lazy. The Grandmaster suggests that Kumatetsu find a disciple in hopes of inspiring him to succeed him.  While wandering the streets of [[Tokyo]] with his makeshift companion, Tatara, Kumatetsu meets Ren and suggests that the boy becomes his disciple. Though Ren is fiercely opposed, he follows Kumatetsu back to the Beast Kingdom out of curiosity but is unable to go back to the human world. As he watches a battle between Iōzen and Kumatetsu, Ren is impressed with Kumatetsu's persistence despite the lack of support from onlookers. When Ren cheers for him, Kumatetsu is easily defeated. However, the Grandmaster declares the actual duel of succession has not come yet.  Taking Ren as a disciple, Kumatetsu gives him a new name, Kyūta in relation to his age. Their initial training sessions go poorly, but Kyūta realizes that he can learn from Kumatetsu by imitating him by performing household tasks. The boy gradually finds that he can predict his master's movements to improve his fighting skills and they soon begin in training together for eight years.  Now as a teen, Kyūta has become a distinguished [[kendo]] practitioner. Through his relationship with Kyūta, Kumatetsu gained his own following of supporters, including the younger son of Iōzen, Jirōmaru, who wishes to be trained by Kumatetsu. Kyūta finds a way back to the human world, and befriends Kaede, a young student.  In the process, Kyūta finds his father, who had been searching for Ren since he disappeared and wants to catch up. Torn by his double life, he is unable to reconcile the resentment he had as Ren and the lack of connections he has as Kyūta. When he rejects both his father and Kumatetsu, he discovers a powerful void within himself that nearly overwhelms him until Kaede calms him down and gives him a bracelet that has helped her when she becomes anxious.  On the day of the succession duel, Kumatetsu loses confidence without Kyūta's encouragement and is nearly subdued by Iōzen. However, Kyūta has been secretly watching and reveals himself, helping Kumatetsu defeat Iōzen. When Kumatetsu is declared the winner and the new lord, Iōzen's elder son Ichirōhiko is revealed to be a human who had been found on the streets of Tokyo as an infant and adopted by Iōzen. Having developed a vacuum in his heart like Kyūta, unwilling to believe that he is a human and not a beast, Ichirōhiko manifests telekinetic powers and seriously injures Kumatetsu with Iōzen's sword. Kyūta is nearly overtaken by his own emptiness and tries to kill Ichirōhiko, but regains his senses with Kaede's bracelet as Ichirōhiko is consumed by darkness and disappears.  Kyūta decides to leave for the human world to fight Ichirōhiko. When Kaede refuses to leave him, they are attacked by Ichirōhiko, who takes the form of a destructive whale. Unable to hold his own against Ichirōhiko, the young man decides to use the vacuum within himself to absorb his opponent's negative energy and then kill himself, saving everyone else. However, Kumatetsu uses his new privilege as the lord and reincarnates as a deity, taking the form of a sword "to be handled with the heart" in reference to their first training session together. He merges with his pupil's form, filling his empty void within him, and defeats his enemy without killing him. Ichirōhiko wakes up surrounded by his adoptive family.  In the aftermath, Ren celebrates his victory with Kaede in the Beast Kingdom and returns to the human world. After reconciling with his father and himself, he attends the local university and keeps Kumatetsu within his heart.  
The Brand New Testament
 God lives in an apartment in Brussels which he shares with his meek wife and his 10-year-old daughter [[Enki|Ea]], to whom he is emotionally and physically abusive. God is a grumpy sadist who created humankind specifically to have something to torment. He manipulates reality via a personal computer which he forbids his family from accessing. One day, Ea sneaks into his office and discovers how He has been mistreating humans. This enrages God who then whips Ea with his belt. Ea decides to rebel against her father. She steals the key to His office and accesses the scheduled dates of death of every human in the world and releases the information to them via their portable telephones. Everyone with a cell phone receives a text message informing them exactly when they will die. Ea then locks God's computer and escapes the apartment through a washing machine which provides a tunnel to the outside world. Wandering the streets of Brussels, Ea decides to follow in the footsteps of her brother Jesus and write a Brand New Testament as her contribution to the human race. She selects six apostles to narrate their life stories. She first enlists a homeless man, Victor, to be her scribe, since she cannot write well.   The first apostle is a reclusive woman who lost her left arm in an accident and feels nobody will love her. The second is a man who hates his work and his life, who has decided to never move from a bench in the park now that he knows the date of his death. Ea translates to allow him to converse with a bird. This induces him to follow a flock of birds to the North Pole. The third apostle is a sexually frustrated man who is awkward with women and remains lovesick for a German girl he met once as a boy. With Ea's encouragement, he becomes a voice actor for porn movies, where he encounters and establishes a relationship with his lifelong fixation. The fourth apostle is a man who is fascinated with death and killing. He purchases a rifle and shoots people knowing that, since all death dates are already predetermined, they can not be his responsibility. Ea prods him to shoot a woman, the first apostle. He hits her in her prosthetic arm. Believing this to be a divine signal, he courts the woman and they establish a relationship, and he learns to embrace life instead of death. The fifth apostle is an elderly woman trapped in a loveless marriage, especially now that her husband knows he will outlive her by many years. Ea persuades her to cheat on her husband. She has sex with a young male prostitute, and then forms a love relationship with a gorilla. The gorilla scares her husband away, to her delight. The sixth apostle is a sickly boy who, when he discovered he had only days left to live, decided to live them as a girl. Ea encourages him to live each day as the equivalent of one month.   God is horrified when he discovers what Ea has done and that he can no longer torment humans. Locked out of his computer, He is powerless. He leaves the apartment using the chute in the laundry room, and in the real world He suffers all the mistreatment and frustrations He created for mankind. He is assaulted by everyone He meets. He discovers to his horror that the tunnel to his apartment has disappeared and He is trapped on Earth powerless and alone. He takes shelter in a church, where his outrageous criticism of his son Jesus Christ provokes a charitable priest into beating him senseless and eventually deporting him to Uzbekistan with a group of illegal immigrants.  Ea and her apostles go to the seaside where hundreds of people have gathered to spend the last hours of their lives. An airplane, which happens to be carrying God under police escort, falls out of the sky and threatens to crash onto the beach and kill everyone. At the last moment, however, God's wife realizes that the number of apostles has grown to 18, her favorite number, explores her husband's work space, unwittingly restarts his computer, and begins to configure a new life for mankind. She deletes the messages that notified people of their death date. The airplane regains altitude and a new creation is born under a flower-filled sky. Victor publishes the Brand New Testament which becomes a bestseller and catapults him out of hopeless poverty into a whole new life of fame and fortune. God reaches Uzbekistan where he works on an assembly line manufacturing washing machines. He keeps on searching without success for the washing machine with the escape hatch that will take him back to his apartment.

Donovan]] is prevailed upon to take on the unenviable task of defending Abel, so that Abel's trial will be seen as fair. Committed to the principle that the accused deserves a vigorous defense, he mounts the best defense of Abel he can, declining along the way to cooperate in the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s attempts to induce him to violate the confidentiality of his communications with his client. Abel is convicted, but Donovan convinces the judge to spare Abel the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] because Abel had been serving his country honorably, and he might prove useful for a future prisoner exchange; Abel is sentenced to 30 years. Donovan [[Abel v. United States|appeals the conviction to the Supreme Court]] based on the lack of a search warrant for the seizure of Abel’s ciphers and photography equipment. For his principled stand Donovan and his family are harassed, including shots being fired at their home. The conviction is upheld.  In 1960, [[Francis Gary Powers|Gary Powers]], a pilot in the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA's]] top secret [[U-2 spy plane]] program, is shot down over the USSR. He is captured and sentenced in a show trial to ten years confinement, including three years in prison.  Donovan receives a letter from [[East Germany]], purportedly sent by Abel's wife, thanking him and urging him to get in contact with their lawyer, whose name is Vogel. The CIA think this is a [[Track II diplomacy|back-channel message]] hinting that the USSR is willing to swap Powers for Abel. They unofficially ask Donovan to go to [[Berlin]] to negotiate the exchange; he arrives just as the [[Berlin Wall]] is going up. Crossing in to [[East Berlin]], he meets with a KGB officer in the Soviet Embassy and is then directed to Vogel, who represents the Attorney General of the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (GDR). The Attorney General seeks to swap Abel for an American graduate student named [[Frederic Pryor]], who had been arrested in East Germany; in the process the GDR hopes to gain official recognition by the United States.  The CIA wants Donovan to forget about Pryor but he insists both Pryor ''and'' Powers should be swapped for Abel. In a message to the Attorney General he bluffs that they will either release Pryor with Powers or there will be no deal. The bluff is successful. As Abel and Powers are poised at opposite ends of the [[Glienicke Bridge]], there is a tense delay until it is confirmed that Pryor has been released at [[Checkpoint Charlie]]. The next day, back in the United States, the government publicly acknowledges Donovan for negotiating the deal that rehabilitates his public image.

Having lived a life of isolation and bullying, John becomes consumed by his desire for revenge after learning he was catfished by the girls. Doing some digging online, John finds that the photo of his nonexistent "girlfriend" was actually that of a deceased Filipina model, then uncovers the identities of the three girls who played him like a fool on their blog with their cruel prank.  While both Avery and Mandy feel bad for what they did to him and show some remorse, Kaley doesn't, being the "mean girl" of their school.    John decides to get back at the girls by hiring a good-looking guy about their age name Nick (Randy Blekitas). Nick is a male prostitute, and John tells him he is playing a trick on his niece, and wants him to get the three girls to fall for him and then stand them up. John finds their hangout, the Skatelab skate park, and sends Nick there to flirt with them. The plan works well, as both Kaley and Mandy express interest and give him their phone numbers.  Nick tells the girls he had just moved from [[Pittsburgh]], and they invite him to a party that Avery is throwing. Though he fails to show, Nick then sends a text message inviting Kaley and Mandy to Skatelab (which was actually sent by John), and when they arrive, it seems as though no one is there. John kidnaps Mandy outside the hangout first, which Kaley initially thinks is a practical joke being pulled by Mandy or Avery. Kaley returns to the party and plays a practical joke on Avery's crush Trevor, pouring water on the crotch of his pants, then posts video of the prank on their blog. At this point, Avery has had enough of Kaley and ends their friendship.  Upon returning home, Kaley turns on the TV, but John uses his computer hacking skills to scare her by turning off the security system in Kaley's home. Having succeeded in panicking her, he then enters the house and kidnaps Kaley at gunpoint, taking her to the warehouse where he is holding Mandy hostage. The next day, Avery is being interviewed by an agent, as the parents of Kaley and Mandy are looking for their daughters. Avery tells the agent about Nick, and the cops mark him as a suspect. Nick spoke to the cop, straightened everything out and told him about John and he was unaware what he was doing.  Later that day, Avery is also kidnapped by John, and having now captured all three girls, he takes them to sell to a man he found online. The man are going to sell the girls for human trafficking. However, John gets scammed by the men, who only take Kaley with them. Afterwards, John takes Mandy and Avery back to the warehouse, where Avery slashes him with a piece of glass and tries to escape, but is unsuccessful. Upon returning home, John's hooker neighbor offers to find him someone else to sell the girls to, and the pair return to the warehouse. However, instead of aiding John in his trafficking attempt, the neighbor shoots him in the arm, allowing Mandy and Avery to escape. John then retaliates by shooting his neighbor in the chest while the girls hide in the warehouse, armed with the neighbor's gun and a cell phone. They call the police and are saved, though John commits [[suicide]] before he can be arrested.   As the film ends, Avery is in the hospital, being questioned by law enforcement.

Along the way, she enters a romance with her assistant coach Ben Lawfort ([[Thomas Middleditch]]), nicknamed "Twitchy" due to his involuntary facial spasms.  Hope's efforts eventually pay off when Maggie qualifies for the Olympic Games. However, she is shocked to discover that Coach Pavleck's gym is in danger of closing because Pavleck had no money to her name when she died. Upon hearing the news, Hope's father confesses that he was the one who had written the letter, to motivate Hope to do something meaningful with her life. After a heated exchange, Hope gets drunk and ends up having sex with Lance Tucker, leading a heartbroken Ben, who witnessed the act, to break off their relationship.  Maggie succeeds in winning the [[gold medal]] and is celebrated as a local hero in Amherst, but announces her intention to begin training with Lance in [[Los Angeles]] instead of staying with Hope. When Maggie fails to show up for an autograph signing at a mall, Hope addresses the disappointed crowd and declares that she will always be Amherst's hero. She comes up with a plan to finance Pavleck's gym on her own by selling uniforms and gymnastics lessons to local girls. She then apologizes to Ben and retains him as her assistant coach.  In the epilogue, a caption reveals that Maggie was forced to abandon her gymnastics career after becoming pregnant with Lance's child.

When he goes to meet her, he falls in love with and finds out that she is designing a video game called SuperCop based on him. From then Riya spends time with him continuously, while Karthik is still afraid of revealing his identity as he fears she might go away from him. Meanwhile, a terrorist attack occurs in a hotel. Karthik's elder brother, Ravi ([[Ravi Prakash]]) and commissioner Marthand ([[Sayaji Shinde]]) confirm that it was a terrorist attack. Later, Ravi finds evidence to prove that it was not a terrorist attack but an attempt to kill 2 rival businessmen by Deepak Raj ([[Arun Vijay]]). He goes to Marthand, but Marthand is actually corrupt and turns Ravi into Deepak Raj who knocks him unconscious. Meanwhile, Riya keeps getting Bruce Lee into fights thinking that he is an undercover cop.

Meanwhile, Deepak captures Bruce Lee and shoots him. Later, Jayaraj, with his men, try to kill Vasundhara, Rahul and Kavya. Bruce Lee comes back as he was aware of all of Deepak's plans.

As Lukas stays and reads his family's [[Bible]], he comes across the story of [[Cain and Abel]]. Aptly fitting the eaglet's own story, Lukas names it Abel.

When Lukas and Abel arrive, Lukas sees a portrait of a young boy and an eagle. Lukas catches a fish with his own hands for Abel, but Abel lets it slip away.

Danzer tries to comfort Lukas by saying Abel only wants to experience the wild, but confesses he doesn't really know what will be of Abel.  Abel tries to hunt a [[chamois]] but fails. As Lukas ponders about Abel's whereabouts, he realizes the two dangers Abel will face; his father's shotgun, and Abel's own brother, whom Lukas has symbolically named Cain. After three days, Abel finally returns to Lukas. Danzer offers to help Lukas how to teach Abel to hunt. Keller, however, complains of Danzer's methods, and warns him. Regardless, they still train Abel with a makeshift method.  Lukas and Danzer get scared when they think Abel is trying to hunt Scout, but later they see Abel simply hunted a weasel.

Danzer, who happens to be nearby, scares the wolf away with his rifle and helps Lukas heal. Unfortunately, the rift between Lukas and Keller grows wider.  Danzer tells the story of the ''Brothers of the Wind'' to Lukas. Lukas wonders how the story ends. Danzer believes that even after knowing the last page they would still not know the outcome.  Lukas decides to leave Keller. Unfortunately, as he leaves, Keller finds him, and asks Lukas to light a match for him. When Keller lights the match, Lukas believes that Keller killed his mother by arson. As Lukas escapes into the mountains, Keller goes afer him. Lukas searches for Abel, but a [[rock slide]] started by a fox stops Lukas from climbing the mountain. A [[lightning strike]]s nearby, knocking Lukas unconscious. Abel soars over him, and Keller wakes him up, stating he is sorry for his ill treatment. An eagle appears to be killed by the rock slide.  Two years later, Lukas and Keller walk by. Lukas says he feels Abel still lives, but Keller tells him he was the dead eagle of the rock slide. Keller then tells Lukas to stretch his arm. Flying above, Abel appears and perches on Lukas' arm. Lukas, deciding it is time to let Abel go for good, takes off a bracelet he put on Abel's foot long time ago. As Danzer watches from the distance, Abel soars into the sky.

Burnt (film)
    Three years ago, Adam Jones ([[Bradley Cooper]]) worked at one of the premier restaurants in [[Paris, France|Paris]], which his mentor Jean-Luc owned.

Adam disappeared, sobered up, and sentenced himself to shucking one million [[oyster]]s at a bar in New Orleans. When Adam finishes shucking his millionth oyster he returns to [[London]] with a plan to regain his former glory and go for his third [[Michelin Guide#Stars|Michelin star]].

Adam wants to take over the hotel's restaurant, but Tony does not trust him after his behavior in Paris. Adam soon learns that Jean-Luc died and feels deep remorse for how he hurt his mentor. Adam visits his friend Conti ([[Henry Goodman]]) at the restaurant Conti owns. He takes a liking to Conti's sous-chef Helene ([[Sienna Miller]]), but Helene finds him old-fashioned and unbearably conceited. Adam locates Michel ([[Omar Sy]]), another of his friends from Jean-Luc's, but Michel opened his own restaurant. Feeling betrayed, Adam released rats in Michel's kitchen and reported him to a health inspector, which led to the restaurant's closure. Michel forgives Adam and agrees to work for him. Adam pays a visit to Reece's, a cutting edge eatery run by Reece ([[Matthew Rhys]]), with whom he has a long-standing rivalry. Reece does not forgive him. Adam also plans to employ another Jean-Luc protege, Max ([[Riccardo Scamarcio]]), after he is released from prison. Unfortunately, Adam's reappearance in Europe attracts the attention of his former drug dealer. Eventually, Tony kicks Adam out of his family's hotel. Adam seeks out chef-on-the-rise David ([[Sam Keeley]]), who agrees to work at Adam's restaurant and let Adam stay in his apartment.  Adam contacts famed restaurant critic Simone ([[Uma Thurman]]) and convinces her to dine at Tony's hotel. Simone's review of Adam's food is favorable enough that Tony and his father agree to renovate their hotel's kitchen and hire Adam as the head chef. They require Adam to submit to weekly drug tests with Tony's psychiatrist Dr. Rosshilde ([[Emma Thompson]]), but Adam refuses  to see her privately. He throws himself into preparing for his restaurant Langhams' grand opening. Max is released from prison and joins Adam's team. Helene rebuffs further job offers until Conti gently fires her. He sends her to the hotel's kitchen, where Helene tears into Adam for getting her fired. Adam offers her a much higher salary and she agrees to work at Langhams. The opening night turns into a disaster, and Adam closes the restaurant early. He becomes furious with everyone, especially Helene. After humiliating her in front of her colleagues and becoming physically aggressive to her, Helene quits.  Adam goes on talk shows to generate interest in the restaurant. He manages to bring another famous restaurant critic to eat at Langhams. The critic's favorable review cements Langhams as one of London's new go-to eateries and drives Reece into a frothing rage. Tony visits Helene to convince her to return to Langhams. He offers double her salary and some insight on Adam's behavior. Helene agrees and Adam treats her with more respect. However, their relationship hits a bump when Adam refuses Helene's request for an afternoon off to hold a birthday party for daughter Lily (Lexie Benbow-Hart). On Lily's birthday, Tony enters the kitchen and asks Adam to make a birthday cake, to which he refuses, though Tony says a diner has requested one. The kitchen staff explain that Tony learned about Helene's denied request and offered to watch Lily at the hotel. Adam delivers a gorgeous cake to Lily in the dining room and makes an effort to connect with her, thereby improving his relationship with Helene.  Once Langhams has established itself, Tony and Adam prepare to earn a [[Michelin Guide|Michelin]] star. Adam continues to fend off his drug dealer's collectors and to see Dr. Rosshilde for drug tests. He remains impervious to her judgments about his sobriety and his perfectionism but, when asked, admits he knows Tony is in love with him.  When Adam receives an invitation to the reopening of Reece's restaurant, he asks Helene to accompany him. Adam and Reece manage to be civil, but the night derails when Adam spots Jean-Luc's daughter Anne Marie ([[Alicia Vikander]]), whom Adam used to date. Adam is surprised when Anne Marie treats him kindly, especially since he abandoned her three years ago and did not attend her father's funeral. Anne Marie has also gotten clean and sober. Helene finds him at a fish market the next morning after he wandered around the whole night mulling over what went wrong in Paris. Jean-Luc was more of a father figure to him than his own dad, and he defined himself by his prowess as a chef. He loved the volatile fast-paced environment of the kitchen and thrived until he did not anymore, began using drugs and eventually came unhinged. He now wants to achieve greatness and does not know how to handle failure.  Adam and Helene share their first kiss in front of the restaurant that morning. Tony interrupts them, but he is not alone. The drug dealer's henchmen have returned, and they want Adam to go with them. He hands the fish to Helene and leaves with them. Tony tells Helene not to worry because Adam can handle himself. That evening, Helene discovers a beaten Adam outside the kitchen entrance. Tony and Helene want to take Adam to the hospital, but before they can do much more than clean him-up, they learn that two Michelin reviewers have come to Langhams. Everyone rushes about in a frenzy, and Adam barely holds things together. They serve the reviewers' meals but minutes later, the two uneaten meals are sent back because their sauces were too spicy. Michel reveals he added cayenne pepper, as revenge for what Adam did to him in Paris. After Michel leaves, Adam laughs maniacally and leaves as well.  Adam wanders around London, climbs onto the railing of [[Waterloo Bridge]] and seems to consider jumping. Instead, he throws his notebook, recording the one million oysters shucked, into the river. Later he arrives at Reece's restaurant drunk and bangs on the windows until the cooks let him in and he makes a nuisance of himself in the kitchen. When he pulls a [[sous-vide]] bag over his head Reece dismisses his kitchen staff, rips the bag off Adam's head and cradles Adam when he breaks down. The next morning, Reece says that he knows Adam is the better chef and appreciates Adam's work because it pushes him to keep experimenting. They part on far better terms. Adam visits Dr. Rosshilde and attends his first group therapy session. When he returns to the hotel, he learns that Anne Marie has paid his drug debt. She also gives him her father's knives and urges him to be with Helene. Tony and Helene find Adam in his hotel room and tell him that the two men the night before were not Michelin reviewers. Adam is so thrilled to have another chance at getting a Michelin star, he kisses Tony. Visibly ruffled by the exchange, Tony leaves Helene with Adam to ensure he doesn't have a concussion and to dress his wounds. The scene ends with Adam and Helene sharing a passionate kiss.  Adam changes the way he runs the kitchen. He listens to Helene and Max's input, and is more supportive of David. When the real Michelin reviewers come to the Langham, he works with the other chefs, especially Helene, to serve a superb meal and receive their third star. The film ends with Adam finally sharing a meal with his cooks and a few laughs.

After failing to get the controversial picture of a congressman and his mistress Natasha, his boss gives him an ultimatum and if he fails to submit a picture, he will be fired. He confides his problem to his best friend Ato ([[Rayver Cruz]]), who is a successful owner of a restaurant. Odie walks by himself and comes across an antique shop he had never seen before. He goes in and is greeted by Santi ([[TJ Trinidad]]), the eccentric owner of the antique shop. Odie's attention is caught when he sees a portrait of a beautiful woman which he recognized was the work of his late father. He offers him a camera that will solve all of his problems but he will need to sign a contract: 1. He should not tell anyone about the store, 2. He should take good care of the camera and not destroy it and 3. He should only take pictures if deemed necessary. A slash on his hands soon appear. Odie reached the peak of his career when Natasha, the congressman's mistress is found by Odie himself, dead in a car. He takes pictures and uploads it to his vlog, gaining him his wanted fame. Then the congressman soon dies, escalating his fame even more when he also found the body. Odie felt guilt when he realizes the happenings are not normal. His camera then reveals another victim and Odie attempts to save the next life. He goes to a parking space where he believes the next victim will be. He is then struck in the back by Chloe Narciso ([[Alex Gonzaga]]). Odie grabs the blunt object from her. He then realized that all along, the camera has been possessing him and he was the one who killed Natasha and the congressman. Odie turns violent and started to move towards Chloe. In fright, Chloe attempts to escape only to be run over by  a car.  === Dinig === The scene then jumps to Chloe walking into a talk show. Chloe is a well-known singer who was pushed to fame by her ambitious mother Maita ([[Lotlot  de Leon]]). Before her fame, she was really a frustrated and terrible singer. Maita then told her to "visit" someone she knew who could help her. The two then went to Santi's shop and asked for his help.

She must take care of the phone and not destroy it and 3. She must not answer any messages unknown to her. A slice then appeared on her hand. One night, Chloe attempted to record herself playing the guitar while singing. As she was really terrible at this, she decided to watch the whole video and to her surprise, she sounded amazing. This led to her being one of the most recognized singer in town. Sometime later, a what seemed to be a personal assistant application popped into her screen and asked Chloe questions which were impossible to be said by a mere technological app. She started talking to it like a real person and it always tells her everything about everyone. When a blind item rumor against Chloe spread all over the internet, the app warned her that it was done by her friends, one of which included Natasha (who was the congressman's mistress), whom she confronted in a restaurant. The app asked Chloe what she wants to do and wished Natasha dead. Natasha, in reality was killed when a vlogger (Odie) revealed it in his website.  After telling her story, Chloe breaks down and the talk show was forced to cut. Suddenly, the voice of the app began bothering her again. She runs to her dressing room and was followed by Maita. The two have a heated argument when Chloe told her she destroyed the phone. Maita walks out. To Chloe's fright, the phone came back, good as new and threatens Chloe that it will victimize her mother next. Chloe runs out of the dressing and into the parking lot where she was confronted by someone before being run over by a car.  === Sarap === Ato is then seen in front of a gothic looking house delivering food from his restaurant. It was raining hard and he is bothered by the odd behavior of the family. When he was forced to stay due to the bad weather, he seemed more and more uncomfortable. The family was speaking nonsense about cannibalism. When the patriarch ([[Jason Gainza]]) arrived home, he asked Ato to help him carry a body bag inside the house. Reluctant and frightened about it, he goes along. He felt relieved and relaxed when the body bag contained a roasted pig. He realized that the family's youngest member was having a Horror- themed birthday party, hence the creepiness he has been feeling. When the family started to eat the cake Ato made and delivered, they all felt weird feelings in their stomachs and began to vomit, eventually killing them. It was revealed that Ato did this on purpose. Before he was a successful restaurant owner, he consulted Santi for help. Santi gave him a small handbook with potion recipes but he needed to sign a contract: 1. He must not tell anyone about the store, 2. He must take good care of the book and not destroy it and 3. He must follow the recipes exactly as they are. A slice soon appeared on his hand. He made a poison to spike the cake with, which killed the family. The secret of his restaurant success is, he uses human meat to serve to his customers and adding concoctions from his book to make it extra special.  === Halimuyak === The scene jumps to a gay man named Pippa ([[John Lapus]]) on an eyeball date with a hunk ([[Markki Stroem]]). Realizing Pipa was gay, he left him in rage. Pippa became really conscious about how he looks and was always teased by men for him being a homosexual. He also ends up jealous with his sister Larra ([[Cai Cortez]]) when Pippa's childhood crush Aldo ([[Manuel Chua]]) harbors feelings for her. Pippa is then threatened by drunk men one night. He comes across Santi's shop and offers to help him. He gives him a bottle of perfume that will make him attractive to all men, but he needed to sign a contract: 1. Never tell anyone about the store, 2. Take good care of the bottle and never destroy it and 3. Have one spray per day and never exceed. Everyday, Pippa is chased through town by handsome men. One day, he goes to a restaurant to meet with Chloe Narciso Fans Club. Pippa then sees Ato (his high school classmate) talking to Odie about something important. Pippa then spots Maita in the restaurant with Chloe, confronting Natasha. As a big fan, Pippa asked Maita if he can have Chloe's autograph to which Maita gladly appreciated. As time runs by, Pippa becomes abusive with his perfume and has an army of men do things for him. Larra becomes worried about her brother. When Larra and Aldo (along with his other male friends) went out for the night, Pippa confronted them and poured all the cologne on himself, the men then became voracious zombies and chased Pippa all around town. He was then cornered as dozens of zombies surrounded him.  === Kanti === After Maita and Chloe's fight in the dressing room, Maita went back to Santi's shop and asked him to help Chloe be herself again. Santi rebuffed her pleas and instead handed her an age-reversing cream, implying that what Maita really wanted was to be beautiful again. She signed a contract which says: 1. She must not tell anyone about the store, 2. She must take good care of the cream and never destroy it and 3. She must not overuse it. It was revealed that Maita was the beautiful lady in the portrait Odie saw earlier. Her fame stopped when she was raped resulting into Chloe coming into her life. The now young and beautiful Maita ([[Janine Gutierrez]]), ventured into a bar to attempt to reconcile with Chloe. She was helped in by the hunk whom Pippa was seen with earlier. She completely forgets about Chloe and started to party hard. Suddenly, bugs began bothering her skin. In fright, she ran out of the bar but was stopped by the hunk and started to sexually assault her. At the parking area, Odie came to his senses and started to look for Chloe. He saw her unconscious body on the floor and shouted at the car driver to help him get Chloe to the hospital. The driver was revealed to be Ato who is determined to make Chloe his next course in the restaurant. Ato points a gun at Odie and before he could kill him, a weakly Chloe bludgeons Ato unconscious. Odie then accompanies Chloe to the hospital to treat her injuries. Pippa was still being chased by the zombified men but comes across a dumpster. He dives in the dumpster to hide his smell from the perfume. As the zombies began to retreat, Pippa spots Maita being molested. He saves Maita from the hunk and the two recognized each other (as they met at the restaurant). Pippa and Maita then go to the hospital and came across Odie and Chloe. Realizing they were all cursed by Santi, they decided to finish it once and for all. Odie concluded that if they exchange their respective products from Santi's shop, they will be able to destroy it without harm. Odie gave Chloe his camera and she gave him her cellphone. Maita gave Pippa her cream and Pippa gave her his perfume. The four confronted Santi when Ato also arrived still with his violent approach. Santi then put them all into a trance as he revealed himself to be the Demon and revealed that their lives are payment for the products they bought. Ato, not being a part of Odie's plan, was killed by Santi. Chloe was threatened by Santi but before he could kill her, Chloe destroyed the camera. Her ears soon bleed. Pippa was almost killed by Santi when he impersonated his sister Larra but Pippa destroyed Maita's cream and escaped. Maita was then surrounded by thousands and thousands of bugs but was able to destroy Pippa's perfume allowing her to escape as well. Odie was confronted by Santi. He was able to smash Chloe's phone before being stabbed in the eye. In the real world, Chloe couldn't hear anything, Odie was blind and Pippa became sensitive to smell. They destroyed the remaining things of Santi and Maita sacrificed herself to burn the contracts and the store. Maita and Santi were killed in the fire. Sometime later, Chloe, now deaf, was in a press conference, with Pippa being her translator. After the conference, they met with a blind Odie. As the three boarded Chloe's van, Santi, who was revealed to be alive, was seen in front of his closed store selling a new batch of items to a new batch of people.

When an eccentric billionaire named Richard Carson devises a plan to fly to the moon, steal the moon's vast mineral resources (Fictional [[Helium-3]]), and destroy the American flag planted by the Apollo XI team trying to prove that America had [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|never visited the moon]] and that he was the first person on the Moon, the [[President of the United States]] orders that NASA plan another space flight to the moon to beat Carson, so that he won't rewrite history, and at the same time prevent Carson from obtaining Helium-3 from the moon which can be used as a [[weapon of mass destruction]].

Carson tries to destroy the space craft in which the trio are traveling.

Capital I
  “Living and ceasing to live are two imaginary solutions; existence is elsewhere” – Andre Breton’s non-deterministic approach towards [[existentialism]] in The first Surreal [[Manifesto]] is brought out through a fiction, which has been categorized into a new genre – Existential Psychodrama !  Capital I is a fictitious character having its root in reality. There was an old house which was locked from inside with all windows closed, and when the police broke open the door, they found no one, neither any living person, nor a dead body. They only found few papers lying, with some abstract phrases and pictures with the signature below reading 'Capital I'. Police found the case unworthy of further investigations, as it doesn't affect anyone. They close the case. But media spreads the rumor about the mysterious character and creates a buzz in the town. A young girl, pursuing MSC Psychology gets involved with her old Physics professor to research about Capital I. They research on the name, the phrases and the pictures and wrack their brain through a lot of intellectual thoughts. They eventually start transforming themselves psychologically. The girl, who wasn't satisfied with her submissive boyfriend living in Delhi, gets into a state of deep trance and starts hallucinating. Under extreme stress of the research, she loses her conscious control. The professor, also into a trance, couldn't break away, and the film suggestively ventures into the inevitable.  The film breaks away from realistic continuity and ventures into the surreal sphere. Scenes move randomly, just like a wandering mind having its root in reality. The film ends with an abstract culmination. Existence meanders through reality and imagination and ventures into a time-independent eternity. Moments tear apart and the debris of thoughts is periodically washed out, through the menstrual cycle of our minds. And the mind gets ready, yet again, for a new conception.

Chappie (film)
 A skyrocketing crime rate leads the city of [[Johannesburg]], South Africa to buy a squadron of scouts—state-of-the-art armour-plated attack robots—from weapons manufacturer Tetravaal.  These autonomous androids are developed by British scientist Deon Wilson and largely supplant the overwhelmed human police force. A competing project within the company is the remotely controlled MOOSE, developed by Australian soldier-turned-engineer Vincent Moore. Deon is praised for Tetravaal's success but Vincent grows envious when the police are unwilling to give his heavy weapons platform equal attention.  At home, Deon creates a prototype [[artificial intelligence]] that mimics a human mind to the point of feeling emotions and having opinions, but Tetravaal CEO Michelle Bradley refuses to let him test the A.I. on a police robot. Undeterred, Deon steals a recently damaged robot before it is destroyed and puts it in his van, along with the "guard key" needed to update the robot's software.  On his way home, he is kidnapped by a group of gangsters, Ninja, Yolandi, and Amerika, who threaten to kill him unless he reprograms a police robot to help them steal. Deon installs the new software into the damaged robot, which responds with child-like trepidation upon powering up. Deon and Yolandi calm the robot, teaching it words and naming it "Chappie". Despite Deon wanting to stay with the robot, Ninja forces him out of their hideout.  Ninja's gang only has a few days to pay a debt of 20 million [[South African rand|rand]] to Hippo, a powerful gangster. Yolandi sees Chappie as a child and wants to mother him, but Ninja grows impatient with his development due to both the impending deadline for the debt and Chappie's irreplaceable battery running out, giving him days to live. Ninja tries to train Chappie to be a gangster by leaving him in a dangerous neighborhood to fend for himself. After being wounded by thugs, he is followed by Vincent, who plans to deactivate all Tetravaal scouts except for MOOSE. Vincent successfully extracts the guard key for his own use, but the traumatized Chappie escapes and returns to the hideout. Yolandi scolds Ninja for this mistreatment, but he manages to earn Chappie's forgiveness by training him in martial arts and weapon handling. Ninja and Amerika trick Chappie into stealing cars for them, and lie about needing the money to replace his dying body.  At Tetravaal, Vincent uses the guard key to upload a virus, thus sabotaging and disabling all scouts including Chappie. Johannesburg's criminals immediately run rampant in the streets, and Deon brings Chappie to the Tetravaal factory to fix him. After being restarted, Chappie notices a helmet used to control MOOSE. At the hideout, he re-engineers it to allow him to transfer his consciousness into a computer, so he can change bodies when his current one dies. Ninja's gang uses Chappie to rob an armored car, an act which is caught on the news, prompting Tetravaal to pursue him. When Chappie learns that Ninja's plan to acquire the body was a lie, he prepares to kill Ninja for betrayal. However, Deon arrives to warn them that Michelle Bradley has ordered that Chappie be destroyed. At that moment, the MOOSE robot (controlled remotely by Vincent) is launched to assassinate Deon and Chappie at the hideout, at the same time that Hippo arrives to collect his debt. Amerika and Hippo are killed in the ensuing battle, while Deon is mortally wounded. When Ninja is about to be killed, Yolandi sacrifices herself to save him and Chappie destroys MOOSE by detonating a bomb.  Enraged by Yolandi's death, Chappie drives Deon to the factory, storms into an office, and fiercely beats Vincent close to death. He then transfers the dying Deon's consciousness into a spare robot through the modified MOOSE helmet. In return, the now-robotic Deon wirelessly transfers Chappie's consciousness into one of the nearby disabled scouts. Deon and Chappie go into hiding as the police discontinue their contract with Tetravaal. While burning memorabilia of Yolandi, the grieving Ninja finds a box containing a doll copy of her and a flash drive marked "Mommy's Consciousness Test Backup" which contains a copy of Yolandi's consciousness that Chappie took while testing the device on her. Chappie hacks into Tetravaal's manufacturing facility, builds a robot resembling Yolandi, and uploads the drive's contents.

Yannis is the Doctor's son-in-law and Dimitris is Yannis' brother. Josef and Yorgos are partners who are close friends with the Doctor.  The final night before they head out on a multi-day journey back to [[Athens]] they play a game in which one player thinks of a person on the boat and the others must ask metaphorical questions such as what type of animal or fruit the person would be in order to guess the person the player is thinking of. Josef is offended when Yorgos guesses he is the person in question that resembles a pineapple. Josef correctly guesses that the person who is a pineapple is the cabin boy. In a huff, Yorgos quits playing saying that Josef isn't the best, he is only the person who is best at that particular game.  Trying to decide on an alternate game to play Christos suggests they play a game he played the previous year called Chevalier. In Chevalier the men set up tasks for them all to perform and whoever wins the most rounds wins a Chevalier signet ring. Yorgos agrees to play, but only if the men compete for who is the best in general, meaning that they will not only judge each other on tasks but on their personality and habits with anything and everything up for grabs. The only one with a Chevalier ring is the Doctor, but as he refuses to lend his ring to the winner, they decide that a ring will be purchased when the group arrives in Athens.  The men immediately begin to judge each other on how they sleep, what they wear, how they drink their coffee.

Once docked at Athens the men decide to stay onboard for several more days to fully complete their competition.

During dinner Dimitris prepares a performance of [[Lovin' You]] which he lipsynchs to. Wanting to encourage his brother Yannis lights sparklers and dances behind him on the dock. After the performance the Doctor coldly rebukes Yannis for being careless with the sparklers. Becoming enraged Yannis lashes out at the Doctor accusing him of disliking him because his daughter Anna is infertile. He then mocks Christos telling him that Anna shared his sexual inadequacies with Yannis and together they make fun of him. Christos is distraught and attacks Yannis and the two men must be separated.  Before the final competition Yorgos prepares a speech where he tells the men that he is shared a special moment with all of them during the trip. He then cuts his hand and asks the men to become blood brothers with him. All the men refuse, except Dimitris who agrees to the blood pact. Rather than slitting his hand, he pulls down his pants and cuts his upper butt cheek before grabbing Yorgos hand and clasping it to him to make them blood brothers.  In the kitchen the cook and his assistant begin to play Chevalier against one another, with the assistant docking points from his employer because he is balding.  Outside the men, having finally finished the game, debark from the boat and head to their cars to go home. Yorgos climbs on his motorbike, with the chevalier ring gleaming on his hand.  
Cherry Blossom Memories
   
Child 44 (film)
 In 1933, a child (Xavier Atkins) orphaned during the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian]] [[Holodomor]] runs away from his orphanage and is taken in by a [[Red Army]] unit and adopted by its kindly commander ([[Mark Lewis Jones]]), who gives him the name Leo Demidov. In 1945, now a sergeant with the unit, Leo ([[Tom Hardy]]) becomes an icon across the [[Soviet Union]] when he is [[Raising a flag over the Reichstag|photographed planting the Soviet flag]] atop the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] during the [[Battle of Berlin]]. He becomes a [[Hero of the Soviet Union]].  In 1953, Leo, now married to Raisa ([[Noomi Rapace]]) and living in Moscow, is a captain in the [[Ministry of State Security (Soviet Union)|Ministry of State Security]] (MGB), commanding a unit tasked with tracking down and arresting dissidents. They arrest a veterinarian, Anatoly Brodsky ([[Jason Clarke (actor)|Jason Clarke]]), and during the arrest, one of Leo's subordinates, the cowardly but ambitious Vasili Nikitin ([[Joel Kinnaman]]), shoots a farmer, Semyon Okun ([[Michael Nardone]]), and his wife in whose barn Brodsky has been hiding, orphaning their two young daughters. Angry, Leo strikes Vasili, who harbours growing resentment against Leo and the other officer in the unit, Alexei Andreyev ([[Fares Fares]]); all three were in Berlin together in 1945. Vasili is in charge of Brodsky's interrogation and execution, and one of the names he gives to their superior, Major Kuzmin ([[Vincent Cassel]]), is that of Raisa, a primary school teacher, several of whose colleagues have recently been arrested for dissident views. Kuzmin orders Leo to investigate his own wife.  Meanwhile, Alexei's young son, Jora (Zdenek Barinka), is found dead near a railway yard. Although the initial pathology report shows injuries consistent with torture, the surgically precise removal of organs, and drowning, the authorities declare that he was hit by a train, as [[Stalin]] has decreed that murder is a capitalist disease; there is no murder in a communist paradise. Alexei is forced to accept the official conclusions to save himself and the rest of his family.  Knowing what the consequences will be, Leo tells his superiors that his investigation has shown that Raisa is innocent of any crime and steadfastly refuses to denounce her. They are both later arrested by Vasili and Alexei and sent into [[exile|internal exile]] in the provincial city of [[Volsk]]. Leo loses all rank and is forced to become a lowly [[Militsiya|militiaman]] under the command of General Nesterov ([[Gary Oldman]]), while Raisa is humiliated by becoming a cleaner in a school.  When the body of another child is found near the railway line in Volsk with similar injuries to Jora, Leo begins to realise that a serial killer is on the loose. After discovering that Alexander Pickup (Anssi Lindström), the man who found the body, is a homosexual, Nesterov forces him to denounce every local homosexual he knows; when Pickup, a railway ticket collector, commits suicide by walking in front of a train, the authorities say the case has been solved. However, Leo persuades Nesterov, who has young sons himself, to investigate further, and the two discover that the bodies of at least 43 more children have been found along the railway line from [[Rostov-on-Don]] to Moscow.  Meanwhile, Vasili, who now has Leo's old job, calls Raisa and attempts to persuade her to leave Leo and join him in Moscow. When she refuses, Vasili orders an MGB agent to abuse her. Raisa later admits to Leo that she only agreed to marry him because she was afraid to refuse the proposal given his status as an MGB officer.  Leo and Raisa travel in secret to Moscow to interview a woman who reported seeing Jora with a stranger in the railway yards. Although Alexei helps them, the interview is unproductive, as the woman is too frightened to talk. Due to a large MGB and militia presence at the station, the pair ask Raisa's former colleague and friend Ivan Sukov ([[Nikolaj Lie Kaas]]), who she knows has contacts among dissident groups, to help them get out of Moscow. However, in his apartment they discover clues that he is in fact an undercover MGB officer (the cause of the arrests in Raisa's school) and that he has called the authorities; Leo kills him and they escape just before Vasili arrives. Leo tells Raisa that she can leave him if she wishes, but she chooses to stay with him.  Leo and Raisa manage to return to Volsk, but there they are arrested by Vasili and his men for Sukov's murder. After being interrogated, Leo and Raisa are put on a train to a [[gulag]]. During the train ride, they are attacked by killers on Vasili's orders; after killing their assailants, Leo and Raisa jump off the train. They hitch a lift to Rostov, where the highest concentration of the serial killer's victims has been found; they correctly reason that the killer must work close to the rail yards there and travel the railway lines to Moscow in the course of his work. Vasili forces Alexei to tell him where they are likely to have gone, promising his family will be safe if he does so; Alexei tells him that Rostov is the likely destination before Vasili shoots him.  In the Rostov tractor factory, Leo identifies the killer by cross-referencing workers' travel assignments with the location and date of the murders. Leo and Raisa pursue the killer, Vladimir Malevich ([[Paddy Considine]]), into the woods and corner him. He surrenders to them and says he cannot control his urges to kill children, but is suddenly shot in the head by Vasili, who has followed Leo and Raisa. Vasili tries to execute them, but, after a vicious struggle, they kill him. Leo cleverly tells the MGB agents who arrive that Malevich killed Vasili and that he then shot Malevich.  Leo and Raisa are both reinstated in their old jobs and Kuzmin is removed for his failures. Leo is offered a promotion and a promising political position by his new superior, Major Grachev ([[Charles Dance]]), if he will agree that Malevich, a former army doctor who spent two years in a German POW camp, was 'turned' by the Germans and sent back to the Soviet Union to wreak havoc there. He refuses the promotion, but requests permission to set up and lead a homicide division in Moscow within the newly created [[KGB]], with the help of General Nesterov. Grachev agrees and Leo in return agrees that Malevich was clearly a [[Nazi]] agent. At least he will now have the ability and power to track down and deal with murderers, even if he still cannot openly admit that they are simply murderers and not enemy agents.  Leo and Raisa track down Tamara and Elena Okun, go to the orphanage where they have been living, and adopt them.

Chi-Raq
 In Chicago's Southside, a war rages between two rival gangs: the Spartans, led by rapper/gang leader Demetrius nicknamed "Chi-Raq", and the Trojans, led by gang lord Cyclops. Demetrius's lover, Lysistrata, grows disillusioned after several outbursts of violence strike near her, including a shootout at Demetrius's concert, an arson attack at their home while the two are having sex, and a young girl being accidentally killed in a gang shooting. Lysistrata moves in after the fire with Miss Helen Worthy, a well-read non-violence advocate who suggests she research about [[Leymah Gbowee]], who led a peace movement to stop [[Second Liberian Civil War]] and threatened a sex strike. Inspired by Worthy and Gbowee, Lysistrata organizes a meeting between herself, the Spartans' lovers, and the Trojans' lovers, where they agree to withhold sex from their men until the men agree to lay down arms.  The strike rapidly spreads across the city, with women of many neighborhoods and occupations joining in on the boycott. But despite its enormous membership, the Spartans and the Trojans refuse to cease their war. Following a funeral for Irene's young daughter killed in a shooting, Lysistrata speaks with the local preacher Fr. Corridan, who argues passionately against the American institutions that profit from the Southside's wars. Deciding that the problem is bigger than the gangs' resentment, Lysistrata and her women seduce their way into a military armory and capture it from its soldiers.  The takeover of the armory sparks a national crisis, with the military and the police surrounding the site, but barred from storming it by force as it was taken by merely 75 unarmed women who are not holding any prisoners. The women's actions also cause their boycott to become famous worldwide, with women from countries all over the world organizing their own sex strikes. The military tries to lure the women in the armory out by playing seductive music, but it fails after the women find the military's earplugs and the men themselves become unbearably sex-starved from the music.  After three months, Cyclops's and Demetrius's gangs begin to grow disillusioned, both from the absence of sex and also from having plenty of time to think over their fate in a gang. Demetrius remains too stubborn to give up the Spartans, but agrees to organize a meeting with Lysistrata after the boycott spreads to the mayor's wife and to the First Lady of the United States. The city arranges a deal: Demetrius and Lysistrata will meet each other in bed and whoever climaxes first loses and must agree to the other's terms. The deal is cut short, though, by Cyclops arriving to declare he and the Trojans are laying down their guns.  The following day, a truce is organized, with Lysistrata, the mayor of Chicago, and Cyclops signing a deal to end gun violence and build new hospitals and trauma centers. Demetrius refuses to sign, but is ultimately moved by Miss Worthy's testimony of the death of her own daughter confessed to by Demetrius's father. He admits that he was the one who killed Irene's daughter, and gives himself up for arrest.

 Rikutaro Maehara lives alone with his mother Yayoi in [[Kawaguchi, Saitama]]. Yayoi is a hostess at a [[hostess club]]. Rikutaro's father, who was an [[iron founder]], died some years ago. When his mother marries Kon Nishino, a divorced man whom she met at the hostess club, Rikutaro suddenly finds himself with a new father, as well as with a sister, Mariko.  As the house is small, the children have to share a room, a situation neither of them is happy with. Since Mariko is of the same age as Rikutaro she is put in the same class at [[primary school]]. There they are teased by some of their classmates, who call Mariko Rikutaro's 'fake sister' and his 'new wife' as, because of their parents' marriage, they now share the same surname. Embarrassed, the children decide to engineer a divorce between Yayoi and Kon, to which purpose they sign a pact drawn up by Mariko. First they try to persuade Kon that the marriage was a bad idea by spoiling the food and suggesting that the ghost of Rikutaro's father might be haunting the house. When this fails, Mariko puts on lipstick and kisses her father's shirt so as to suggest that he is having an affair. Yayoi sees Mariko with the lipstick, however, and then helps her apply another colour that 'suits her more'. She subsequently gives Mariko the lipstick.  Gradually, the children begin to bond. Rikutaro shows Mariko the [[Shinto Shrine]] in Kanayama-cho where he and his father used to pray to the [[Kami]] of metal production, and takes her to the foundry where his father used to work. There, he introduces her to Takashi Iizuka, who was one of his father's colleagues, and gives her a piece of iron from the foundry that he polished. Mariko's kiss on Kon's shirt proves to have been prophetic, however. Kon, who has found a job at a real estate agent, starts staying away until late at night, leaving the children to their own devices. The film heavily implies that he is having an affair with a colleague from work. Yayoi, however, only finds out that Kon does not come home after work when Mariko comes down with a fever and Rikutaro calls her at the hostess club, not knowing what to do, and unable to reach Kon.  Kon refuses to tell Yayoi what he does at night, claiming that 'she would not understand'. The children briefly run away together, to one of Mariko's favourite childhood spots. There, she reveals to Rikutaro that a letter in which her biological mother promisses to visit her was actually written by herself.

Upon waking Molly, reveals that the ghost is actually a pregnant teenager who died back when the school was a convent after the convent's [[nun]]s gave her a gruesome surgery to remove the baby. The ghost is only interested in having someone give birth to her child and if someone refuses, they're murdered – explaining last year's deaths. Despite impregnating Molly, the ghost sees Ben holding a weapon which the ghost views a threat, and the ghost kills him. The ghost then unlocks the door and allows Molly to leave.  ===Second story=== Scott Peters ([[Adrian Holmes]]) is a [[police officer]], but this doesn't stop him from going into woods owned by "Big Earl" (Alan C.

However, they are picked off one by one until only Caprice remains. Caprice manages to flee to Great-Aunt Etta's house. She is successful in killing Krampus who transforms into Gerhardt. It's revealed that he transformed into Krampus due to his anger over the family's actions and that Etta was fully aware that this would happen.

Thereafter, every two minutes, another person is killed. After several people die, they realize they can vote for who dies. When nobody votes, one is selected randomly.  After arguing over criteria, a college guy suggests that they vote together for the elderly. Having bought several minutes by not arguing, they discuss where they are, how they got there, who has abducted them, and why. One person claims to remember being in traffic and attempting to flee Los Angeles, which jogs the memories of others. He is the only one to remember his abduction until an elderly man says he saw and spoke to aliens. As the elderly man describes them, several others accuse him of lying to prolong his life; he is killed next.  When the college guy proposes a middle-aged woman as their next target, several people who do not consider her elderly object. The woman describes herself as a 52-year-old cancer survivor, which draws suggestions that she is going to die anyway. A doctor joins others in her defense, and when the college guy pushes for the cancer survivor's death regardless, people select him instead. Several people say they recognize the others: the doctor and a man possibly had an affair, a man identifies the woman next to him as his wife, and a cop points out an alleged girlfriend -beater, a tattooed man who initially denies the allegations but under pressure says she deserved it and is eliminated.  After several minorities are quickly eliminated, an African-American man claims the process has become racist. Several others dispute this, but when the cop goes on a racist rant, he is selected next. They attempt to give 1 vote to every person in the circle, but one man votes for the pregnant woman, so a man identified as Eric votes for him. They tie, and the man is killed in a run-off vote. Intrigued, the captives experiment with voting. They find they cannot vote for themselves, and all ties must be resolved, meaning that one of the final two people left must volunteer to die or else both will die. After several volunteer to die, a skeptical faction led by an atheist and an Asian boy antagonizes the theists who praised the volunteers' faith. The atheist is briefly saved, but when he accuses a pretty girl beside him of being a porn star, which she denies, he is killed. A lesbian becomes a target, but the lawyer who argued strongest for her selection is killed instead.  After several eliminations, two main blocs emerge: one that wants to protect the pregnant woman and a young girl, and another that wants to eliminate them immediately as a threat to their survival. A soldier, a one-armed man, and Eric argue everyone should sacrifice themselves to save the girl and pregnant woman for last, while a faction led by a rich man argues that everyone is equal, and no special privileges should be afforded to anyone. The husband is forced to vote with the soldier's bloc when they threaten to eliminate his wife, but, under interrogation, they admit they concocted the relationship to curry favor. They are both eliminated, and the two factions aggressively thin their opponents' numbers.  Eventually, only Eric, the pregnant woman, a silent man who has never voted, and the girl are left. Eric theorizes that aliens have used the process to learn about humanity's values. After the silent man is eliminated, Eric encourages the young girl to join him in suicide. However, at the same time she dies, Eric quickly votes to kill the pregnant woman. Eric waits to be freed, but then ties with the pregnant woman's unborn child, whom he votes to kill. Eric wakes in Los Angeles where he joins a group of people, mostly pregnant women and children, watching a fleet of hovering alien craft.

The Clan (film)
 The story is based on the case of the [[Puccio family]] from [[Buenos Aires]], that kidnapped four people -three of whom they murdered- in the 1980s.<ref name=BBCplot></ref>  The Puccios appear to be a typical middle-class family from the affluent district of San Isidro, with aspirations of [[Social mobility|moving up]] into upper class. The family comprises Arquímedes Puccio, the family patriarch; Epifanía Puccio, his wife; Alejandro, their eldest son and a star rugby player; Daniel "Maguila", their middle child, who'd left the country years ago and hadn't kept in touch; Silvia, their eldest daughter, a school teacher; Guillermo, their youngest son, who is still in high school; and Adriana, their youngest daughter, who is in middle school.  At the end of the [[Falklands War]] in 1982, Arquímedes, who had been working for the state's intelligence services in operations to capture communist guerrilla fighters, becomes the owner of a small shop, a deli. In order to maintain his financial status, he decides to turn to crime and start kidnapping people for ransom, targeting wealthy families. Alejandro starts to collaborate with his father, by identifying potential hostages, taking advantage of his popularity among friends and acquaintances to not raise suspicion.  The first victim is Ricardo Manoukian, a friend and teammate of Alejandro's. Though the kidnapping is successful, Arquímedes kills Ricardo anyway, to avoid any chances of being identified as the kidnapper. After discovering Ricardo has been killed, Alejandro has a bout of conscience, but his father convinces him to keep the secret by assuring him that if Ricardo had been left alive, he would have identified them as the culprits and gotten them all arrested.  The ransom improves the Puccios' economic situation and, by early 1983, they replace their family deli with a successful store selling sporting equipment. Alejandro meets a girl called Monica at the store, and, after a few dates, she becomes his girlfriend. Meanwhile, Gustavo Contenpomi, a friend of Arquímedes' who is furious after being deceived in a business deal with entrepreneur Florencio Aulet, contacts the Puccios and suggests they make Florencio their next victim. Instead, Arquímedes and his cronies kidnap Florencio's son, Eduardo; since he is one of Alejandro's friends, and thus he's easier to lure into a trap. The Aulets pay the ransom, but Eduardo has already been murdered, and his body buried in a shallow grave, on an empty construction lot.  In December 1983, after the [[Argentine general election, 1983|return to democracy in Argentina]], Arquímedes goes to visit imprisoned military officer [[Aníbal Gordon]] - who had participated with Puccio in the kidnapping of a businessman in 1973 - and asks for advice on how to continue with the Clan's activities in the new political landscape. Gordon advises him to lie low, since the military will have more difficulty protecting him now that they've lost control of the country, but Arquímedes does not heed the warning.  Alejandro accompanies his youngest brother, Guillermo, to the airport, since Guillermo is going abroad on a sports trip. At the gate, Guillermo confesses that he knows what Alejandro and their father had been up to, and says he will not be returning after the tour is over, since he is afraid of what will happen if the family's crimes are discovered. Before leaving, Guillermo begs his brother to get out while he still can. Listening to his brother's plea, Alejandro decides not to join his father in the next kidnapping: that of another businessman acquainted with the family, Emilio Naum. Due to Alejandro's absence, the plot fails, and Naum is murdered after refusing to stop his car when Arquímedes and his goons begin the abduction. Angered, Arquímedes returns home and beats Alejandro, blaming him for the failed kidnapping and accusing him of being ungrateful for all that Arquímedes sacrificed to get him a cushy lifestyle.  To reconcile with his father, Alejandro travels abroad to convince his other brother, Maguila, to return to Argentina and join the Clan in their operations. Now, in 1985, the group kidnaps businesswoman Nélida Bollini Prado and keep her prisoner in their home's basement. However, things do not go according to plan: the ransom negotiations fail; Adriana hears the woman's screams coming from the basement and realizes what had been going on; and Arquímedes gets a call from his former military superiors warning him that his stunts have garnered too much public attention, so he no longer has their protection.  In August 1985, when Arquímedes and Maguila collect the ransom in a service station, they are arrested by the police, who then break into the Puccio house, free the kidnapped victim, and arrest the family, with the exception of Adriana. The case causes a frenzy among the media, who dub the family the "Puccio Clan".  The prosecuting attorney shows Arquímedes the overwhelming evidence against him and tries to broker a deal: if Arquímedes confesses to being the mastermind behind the kidnappings, his family will not be indicted as accomplices. Arquímedes, however, insists that he'd been compelled to carry out the crimes by his military superiors and refuses to sacrifice himself for his family.  While his rugby team and Monica believe in his innocence, Alejandro can not withstand the pressure. After violently  arguing with his father in their jail cell (during which Arquímedes goads Alejandro to punch him, so  Arquímedes can falsely claim the guards beat him), Alejandro tries to commit suicide by throwing himself off the fifth floor of the Tribunal building while he's being taken to testify.  The film ends with a series of texts detailing the family's fate:  *Alejandro survived his fall and was sentenced to life in prison. While serving his sentence, he tried to commit suicide four more times. Monica kept visiting him for years, until he asked her to stop doing so and instead move on with her life. Alejandro died [of pneumonia, aged 49<ref name = "BBC"></ref>] in 2008, a few months after being released on probation.  *Maguila never served his sentence, since he fled the country - presumably to Australia, Brazil, or New Zealand - before he could be tried. In 2013, he returned to Argentina after the charges were dropped due to the statute of limitations.  *Guillermo was never indicted for his family's crimes. He never returned to the country nor contacted his family, and his whereabouts are unknown.  *Epifanía and Silvia were freed from prison for lack of evidence. [Silvia succumbed to cancer in 2011.<ref name = "BBC"/>] *Adriana was also never indicted and, after the trial began, her surname was changed, and she moved in with her maternal uncles. After many years, she returned to live with her mother [in the very house where the kidnapping victims had been held<ref name = "BBC"/>].  *Arquímedes was sentenced to life imprisonment but was eventually released on parole in 2008. His family never made contact with him after he regained his freedom.

Ten years later, eighteen year old Oscar is close to graduating high school and hopes to apply to a special effects make-up school in New York by creating a portfolio using his best friend Gemma as a model. He gets a job at a hardware store in order to try to spend less time with his father, who is casually homophobic, childish and ignorant towards his son, and continues to try to push away his mother. Oscar suddenly notices a new employee after one of his shifts, the confident and charismatic Wilder who asks to borrow his shirt. Oscar is immediately attracted to Wilder but when he begins to think about his feelings, a sharp pain in his stomach disrupts him. Upon returning home, Buffy tells Oscar that he seems happier and suggests that he is in love, a notion that he quickly dismisses. When Wilder returns the shirt, Gemma makes a joke and tries to probe Oscar for more information about their relationship but he brushes her off. Later that day, he takes his shirt into a bathroom and starts to smell it, thinking of Wilder and attempting to masturbate but he is stopped by another pain. Oscar's dad makes a scene at his work which embarrasses him. When Oscar goes inside, he finds that his dad has brought a girl back. The three of them talk in the kitchen where Oscar's dad insults his ex wife and makes homophobic comments about her new fiancé.

His dad then asks Oscar how he got home from work and he tells him that he walked.  The next day, Oscar's dad tries to ask Gemma whether she and Oscar have slept together. Oscar quits his job and finds that Wilder has been fired and his planning on moving away but he invites Oscar to a goodbye costume party at his house later that night. Upon returning home, Oscar finds out that he has been rejected from the make-up school in New York (the only one to which he applied), goes up to his room and shouts at Buffy when she tries to ask him what is wrong. He begins trying on some of his mother's clothes, which his father vindictively keeps despite having no need for them, for the party. His dad opens the door and the two begin to argue, culminating in his dad forbidding him from going to a "faggot costume party". Oscar kicks his dad into the closet and runs out of the house. He arrives at the party and quickly finds Wilder, whose roommates give him drugs. Oscar unsuccessfully tries to work out if Wilder is gay using a method two young girls taught him when he was eight. Oscar brushes off Gemma and tries to catch Wilder's attention but he instead ends up talking to another partygoer named Andrew, who flirts with him. The two start dancing together when Oscar sees Wilder kissing a girl but once Andrew tries to grope him, Oscar feels another pain in his stomach and runs to the bathroom. Andrew follows him and the two start to have sex however, they are interrupted when the pain causes Oscar to hallucinate throwing up bloody metal. After passing out, he is woken up by Wilder who, upon being told that he can't go home, takes Oscar to his treehouse. Lying on the bed, Wilder asks Oscar how long he has known he was gay but Oscar tries to avoid the question but eventually opens up and says that he is confused. Wilder tells him that, if he is gay, he should feel something in his stomach and offers to kiss him. Although hesitant at first, Oscar eventually kisses him.  When Oscar wakes up, Wilder is gone. Not wanting to see his dad, Oscar goes to his mother's house and he finally confronts her for abandoning him when she divorced his father. He admits that he always feels alone and unwanted but his mother comforts him and suggests that he stay with her. Oscar suddenly realises that he has left Buffy at his dad's and immediately goes to retrieve her. He climbs through a window into his room and finds that his father has destroyed it. Hearing the noise, his dad opens the door and refuses to tell Oscar where Buffy is, to which Oscar coldly says that his dad should not be surprised that everyone in his life leaves him. He goes down to the driveway and finds the rest of his stuff in a pile. His mother arrives in her car and she and Oscar's dad begin fighting while he looks through his possessions and finds Buffy's dead body. He begins to feel a pain in his stomach again and hallucinates a metal rod bursting out of him. He pulls it out of his stomach, hits it against a nearby pile of wood and threatens his dad with it, forcing him to hide inside the house. Oscar then ties the metal rod around the door handle, locking his dad inside.  At his mother's, Oscar tells her that he didn't get into the one college that he applied to. She suggests an artist's colony where he can express his creativity. Before leaving, Oscar reconciles with Gemma. He arrives on the island and begins to decorate his room before having one final conversation with Buffy. After finally beginning to accept the truth about himself, Buffy reveals her truth to Oscar, that she is obviously not the original hamster from his childhood and that she has been replaced at least four times by his parents (who didn't even notice that the most recent incarnation was a male). He places her into a small wooden boat and pushes her body out to sea. He returns to his room and thinks back on some of the happier times he and his father shared.

The Cokeville Miracle
 In May 1986, cop Ron Hartley (Jasen Wade) is at a crime scene, during which two people were murdered. He is traumatized from the experience and begins to question the beliefs of his religion.  In [[Phoenix, Arizona]], David Young (Nathan Stevens), former town marshal of [[Cokeville, Wyoming]], tests a bomb he made on an old bus, which succeeds. He then expresses his triumph with his second wife, Doris (Kymberly Mellen). In Cokeville, Ron is playing with his two children; Cindy (Alexa Rae) and Jason (Kimball Stinger). When the family's nightly prayer comes, Ron refuses to say it, as he is questioning his faith due to all the horrible things he's seen. His wife Claudia (Sarah Kent) is worried for him.  On a Sunday, Ron does not attend his church with his family. Meanwhile, David is travelling with Doris, buying groceries as materials. He has his two friends Gerald Deppe and Doyle Mendenhall (Channon Voyce and Paul Hunt) meet him in Cokeville. David and Doris demonstrate igniting gunpowder while it is in the air, making it seem as the air is on fire. Deppe and Mendenhall take the plot as launching illegal fireworks. The next day, the five set out for [[Cokeville Elementary School]], where David reveals their real plan is to take the school hostage and blow it up with his bomb, which will then lead to David being the leader of a "brave new world". Deppe and Mendenhall refuse to cooperate, and David handcuffs them in the back of his van.  Ron, on the same day, travels to help his brother with some issues, while Cindy and Jason go to the school. During the past few days at the school, the fire alarms have been going off without any smoke or any other trigger, baffling the staff. David, Doris and Penny ([[Caitlin EJ Meyer]]), one of David's two daughters from his previous marriage, bring the bomb into the school, with Doris and Penny carrying firearms. Penny is reluctant to follow the plan. The three walk into the school undetected, and announce to their secretary, Christina Cook (Jillette Dayton), their plan. They take her hostage, and when David starts harshly yelling at a student, Penny confronts him. Instead of shooting her like he had earlier threatened, he gets his car keys and throws them at her, commanding her to leave, saying she is no daughter of his.  After Penny leaves, David and Doris take three people (two staff, one student) and take them into Room 4, where David takes control of a class in the room. Doris then manipulates the rest of the school to go into Room 4, telling them "a surprise" waits for them. After all 136 students and 18 teachers are in the room, David takes control by sitting next to the bomb, where if he pulls the trigger it will set it off, and with the firearms. After a few minutes, Max Excell (Alan Peterson), the principal, who had been away, walks in and discovers the situation. David tells him to call the local authorities and tell them he demands $2,000,000 for each child, and if he doesn't return in 15 minutes, he will shoot the students, one by one.  Penny travels to the local police station where she informs them of her father's plan, proving it by showing them Deppe and Mendenhall, still handcuffed. The police take the three for questioning, while they start informing the families. Ron begins to return to Cokeville, when he is informed of the hostage situation. He is still far out, but starts to rush towards Cokeville, as he is the nearest officer and every other one is out of town. In the school, gas from the bomb begins to leak, and children are getting sick. One of the teachers convinces David to let them open the doors and windows. After the principal returns, David demands him to call the White House.  After a few hours, including plans by the teachers to create a boundary between the bomb and the children, David is getting more and more agitated especially when Jason starts to taunt him. After Jason crosses the boundary around the bomb, David's emotions are let out, and he yells at Jason. While David is in the restroom, Doris has the trigger for the bomb, but accidentally triggers it after jerking her hand. The bomb explodes, and Doris suffers severe burns. The children are quickly evacuated as firefighters and paramedics are stationed right outside. David kills Doris to put her out of her misery, and shoots a teacher, John Miller (Joshua Cooper), in the back. Everyone safely evacuates, and David kills himself. Ron is informed of the bombing, and he expresses that God isn't real. He arrives in town, rushing towards the school.  A few days later, Jason and Cindy have both sustained burns, but are physically fine. Jason, however, seems traumatized and Ron takes him to see a psychiatrist. After the appointment, the doctor is baffled and tells Ron to have a talk with Jason. Ron and Claudia both talk to Jason, who then tells him "there were other people in the room". He confides in them that he saw angels. Ron doubts this, but Claudia believes him after he points out a picture of his great-grandmother, who passed away years earlier. Ron questions this, and Claudia convinces him to gather evidence.  He visits multiple families, who inform him of similar experiences. He visits the local bomb expert, Rich Haskell ([[Rick Macy]]), who tells him that 3 of the 5 wires in the bomb were mysteriously cut. Haskell also points out that the windows provided an opening for the explosion. He is baffled that shrapnel David put in the explosive flew around, but no one was injured. While Ron speaks with Claudia, he tells her he found out every one of the hostages prayed some time during the crisis, and that some ran back into the room to help others. Despite all this information, Ron is reluctant to believe it.  On Sunday, Jason refuses to attend church unless his dad does so as well. Motivated to attend for Jason, Ron tries to make it through the meetings. But after the main meeting, Ron's doubts start to control him again, and he tells Claudia that he can't do it. She tells him that he needs to control it, or he could lose her and their children. Ron then overhears some words the bishop, John Teichart (Shawn Stevens), is saying in a class, where he says that hatred will not be the answer, but prayer will. Ron then goes to the youth room, where they are singing "A Child's Prayer". He notices that almost all of the kids in the room have some injuries of some kind, and he becomes humble and asks God for forgiveness for doubting Him. Cindy and Jason notice him and run to him, and he asks them to forgive him. That night, at the family prayer, Ron is saying it for the first time in days.

Before his death, a fellow [[American Football|football]] player, [[Justin Strzelczyk]], comes to him, and confides that he is starting to lose his memory, that he is saying odd things to his children, and nearly threw his wife against the wall. A disoriented Webster brushes the worries off, and deliriously tells him that the most important thing "is to finish the game," which is what he said during his Hall of Fame speech.  [[Bennet Omalu]], a [[Forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] with the [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]] [[coroner]]'s office, handles Webster's [[autopsy]]. He wonders how a man, otherwise healthy, and fairly young, could have degenerated so quickly, and makes it a point to figure out why he died of a heart attack at only fifty. Omalu closely examines microscope slides of Webster's brain and discovers that he had severe brain damage. He ultimately determines that Webster died as a result of the long-term effects of repeated blows to the head, a disorder he later calls [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE). With the help of former Steelers team doctor Julian Bailes, fellow [[Neurology|neurologist]] [[Steven T. DeKosky]] and county coroner [[Cyril Wecht]], Omalu publishes a paper on his findings, which is initially dismissed by the [[National Football League|NFL]].  Over the next few years, Omalu discovers that three other former NFL players, Strzelczyk (died 2004), [[Terry Long (American football)|Terry Long]] (died 2005), and [[Andre Waters]] (died 2006), had symptoms very similar to Webster's. He finally persuades newly appointed NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] to allow him to present his findings before a committee on player safety. However, the NFL does not take him seriously, and he is barred from the committee meeting, forcing Bailes, a former NFL employee, to give the presentation in his place. However, the meeting is a set up, where the NFL claims that the players' head trauma was due to past injuries, having nothing to do with football. As he leaves the meeting, former [[National Football League Players Association|NFL Players Association]] executive [[Dave Duerson]] angrily confronts Omalu and tells him to "go back to [[Africa]]."  Omalu is subjected to considerable pressure to back down from his efforts, as football is a widely beloved sport in Pittsburgh, having provided jobs and allowed men go to college. Wecht is subjected to a politically motivated prosecution on corruption charges, and Omalu is forced to leave Pittsburgh soon after, lest he be deported, or sent to prison on petty charges as punishment for tarnishing the NFL. Before leaving he urges the NFL to tell the truth. Omalu's wife, Prema, suffers a [[miscarriage]] after being stalked. The Omalus are forced to leave their dream home outside Pittsburgh. They move to [[Lodi, California]], where Omalu takes a job with the [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin County]] coroner's office.  Three years later, Omalu is vindicated when Duerson commits suicide due to growing cognitive problems. In his suicide note, Duerson admits that Omalu was right. Omalu is allowed to address an NFLPA conference on concussions and CTE. He informs them that he once wished he had never known Mike Webster, but by knowing him, he has the responsibility to inform NFL players of the true risks that they take by playing. He says that he holds no resentment for the NFL and tells them to forgive themselves and be at peace. Amid growing scrutiny from [[United States Congress|Congress]], the NFL is forced to take the concussion issue more seriously, and in 2011, [[2011 NFL lockout|NFL players sue the league]] for not properly informing them of the risk of CTE. Omalu is offered a job as chief medical examiner for the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], but as explained in closing title cards, turns it down, remaining with Prema and their two children in California, where he became a U.S. citizen in February 2015.

 Two young boys, Travis and Harrison, are walking through a field. Cursing as they walk, they come to a barbed wire fence and take turns climbing through it. While continuing their walk they come across a cop car in a lightly wooded area. Travis dares Harrison to touch the cop car. He refuses, so Travis touches it first, saying that if he does it so does Harrison. After realizing that there’s nobody around, the boys try opening the doors. Harrison finds that the driver's side door is open and Travis hops in. The boys play around in the car until Travis hits the visor and the car keys fall into his lap. He starts the car and the boys both hop out and hide behind some bushes. After a few seconds Travis gets back in the car and puts it into drive. Harrison hops in and they take off, driving wildly through the open field.  The next scene takes place earlier: a cop car pulls up and Sheriff Kretzer ([[Kevin Bacon]]) gets out of the car. He takes a sip of root beer before placing it on the hood of his car. He removes some of his uniform and grabs a bag from the back seat. He lays a tarp on the ground and he pulls a body from the trunk. Kretzer struggles to drag the body deeper into the wooded area and stops when he realizes that one of the shoes fell off the foot of the corpse. After finding the shoe again, he drops the body into a hole before emptying a bag of [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] into the hole. He starts walking back towards his car only to realize it is no longer there. Kretzer makes a call to the police station, telling the dispatcher his radio is down and he can be reached on his cell.  Harrison starts playing with the radio before asking Travis for a chance to drive. They come to a locked gate that Harrison uses the car to break through. Travis tries to get Harrison to go as fast as they can before he jumps into the driver's seat himself. They drive off, just missing a woman driving in an oncoming lane.  Kretzer runs towards a trailer park where he steals a car. After driving through town he gets pulled over by a cop on a motorcycle. He calls in a fake robbery nearby and the motorcycle cop responds to the call, leaving him free to leave. He gets a call from dispatch informing him of a report of a stolen sheriff's car and tells dispatch to ignore the report. After getting the other officers to switch their radio to a different channel, he uses the old channel to call the boys, but they do not answer. They are running in a field playing with Kretzer's weapons and gear found in the back seat. The boys hear someone screaming from the trunk of the car and open it to see a man covered in blood. He pleads with them to help him saying the cop is the bad guy. After being unable to talk with the boys, Kretzer dumps bags of [[cocaine]] in the toilet. He hears a voice on the radio and runs out to talk to one of the boys to find out where they are.  The man from the trunk has put the boys in the back seat and tries to find a hiding spot before jumping back in the cop car and driving up the road. He threatens the boys, telling them not to tell the man who owns the car where he is hiding. Kretzer shows up in his truck and slowly walks towards the car. While talking to the boys he senses something is not right and ducks behind the car.  The woman that the boys almost hit shows up and walks towards the car, screaming at the boys. She sees Kretzer, who claims to be injured and asks her to look for his keys (in the direction where he suspects the man is hiding). The woman spots the man from the trunk and a gun fight erupts after he shoots the woman. Both the sheriff and the man from the trunk shoot each other. After several tries, the boys manage to escape the car by shooting out the window. Travis has been hit by one of the earlier ricochets, so Harrison gets in the driver's seat and drives away with Travis in the back.  The sheriff awakens and enters his truck. He taunts the boys on the radio while chasing them and tries to run them off the road. Harrison sees a cow and swerves to avoid it, while the sheriff drives straight into it. Having finally stopped the sheriff, Harrison continues driving toward town with a possibly dying Travis, when Harrison receives a radio call from dispatch and replies, leaving their fates ambiguous.

Convergence (film)
 In 1999, after an explosion at a women's health clinic in Atlanta, police detective Ben Walls is called back into active duty while on leave.  As he investigates the scene, a second explosion goes off, and he loses consciousness.  He wakes up at a hospital, and captain Miller, his superior officer, orders him to stay in bed.  Eager to contact his wife and return to duty, he dresses and leaves his room, finding the hospital nearly empty.  A nurse explains that most of the hospital's workers have been redirected toward a major fire in the city, which Walls assumes is the clinic bombing.  The nurse directs him to a chapel, where she says several people are gathered.  He finds Miller there with Ester, Jude, and Isaac.  Miller gives him change to contact his wife at a payphone.  After calling his wife, Walls can only speak a few words before the line goes dead.  He attempts to leave the hospital, only to find the door locked.  A security guard named Peter "Grace" Grayson offers to let Walls use the phone in his office, though the line turns out dead.  Grayson says he knew Walls' parents, but a man in a paramedic's uniform shoots Grayson before he can explain further.  Walls binds Grayson's wound and chases the paramedic, who knocks him unconscious.  Because he is not wearing his glasses, Walls does not get a good look at the man's face.  Walls reports the attack to Miller, but the nurse says Grayson's body is missing.  Miller and the others from the chapel believe a man named Daniel to be responsible, though they do not tell Walls.  Daniel, the paramedic, captures Jude and questions him about his belief in God.  Jude says he no longer believes in God, and Daniel cuts out Jude's tongue when he curses God.  After branding Jude with his cult's symbol, Daniel gains control over him.  Daniel lures away the nurse when he says he has found Grayson, and he gains control over her, too, after branding her.  After the nurse attacks him, Walls has a vision of his body in the hospital.  Grayson briefly appears before him and explains that the situation is more complicated than being dead.  Walls confronts Miller, demanding to know why nobody told him the truth, and Miller says that he was prohibited from doing so because of the rules.  Miller orders the others to hide while he stays behind to face Daniel and his cult, but Isaac insists on helping Miller.  As Isaac and Miller engage in a shootout with Daniel's followers, Walls and Ester discuss [[grace in Christianity]].  Ester says that grace is the only way to escape the hospital, which is a test of their faith.  Walls, whose parents were missionaries killed in a bombing, expresses his skepticism in religion.  Isaac disappears when he enters the chapel, and Miller is shot.  Daniel stops his followers from killing Miller, and they search for Ester.  Walls finds Miller and helps him to the chapel, where Miller also disappears after expressing his faith.  Walls tricks the nurse into entering the chapel, and Ester kills her there.  She disappears after entering the chapel, though Walls is confused when he does not.  In a vision, Grayson explains it is because he is not ready.  Walls encounters two ghost hunters, Kris and Casey, who explain they are from 2015 and investigating the 1999 clinic bombing.  They ask Walls to discover Daniel's conspirator.  Daniel reveals he was a member of Walls' parents' congregation but broke away when they adopted a more loving and inclusive message.  Enraged at their perceived heresy, Daniel bombed their church.  As the ghost hunters flee, Walls captures Daniel and tortures him for the name of his conspirator, to Casey's shock.  Before she leaves, Walls gives his recovered glasses to Casey, who returns them to his wife, Hannah.  On the news, Hannah is relieved to see that Daniel's conspirator has finally been caught.

The Coven (film)
 The film opens with a map of Queen’s Wood in Highgate. A burning tree appears in a dark night. A goats head is overlaid visually in the tree. The scene then moves to a school where Mr. Shears ([[Dexter Fletcher]]) is giving a lesson about Witchcraft. He holds a book with a title page containing the words ‘Diabolus quod igneus frutex’, meaning the devil is the fire tree. He asks the class ‘Is Wicca a religion or little more than devil worship’. He mentions that [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Robert Cochrane]] ‘founded a Wicca coven as recently as the 1960s’, and that his coven split up, but later reformed and met in the nearby Queens Wood at the titular coven, a particular ring of trees. He is interrupted by a Mrs. Belial, posing as a supply teacher who tells him that he needs to see the headmaster. He leaves and she takes over the lesson. She explains how there was a spiritual leader and politico, Uri Clef who went missing on Halloween with seven of his followers, and they were last thought to be in Queen’s Wood.  Five of the girls decide to go into the Queens Wood on Halloween, on the way they are involved in a near miss with a biker while crossing a road. They enter the wood and discover the word Lucifer in ash upon the ground. They notice that their five names have first letters that are the letters of Lucifer. Izzy, one of the girls, adds their names in chalk underneath. As they put up their tent they are watched, apparently by the biker from earlier. The film then cuts to the lounge of one of the other girls in the class, Eve, who was not invited, she has found a nursery rhyme that states ‘You can make him go away with a cross stick, you can make him go away with a shoe’. Her private tutor explains that it refers to the devil. He says that there are plague pits in Queen’s Wood and that those who were buried went to the devil. He asks "I wonder how the devil gets people now".  Meanwhile, two boys, Eddie and Louie, decide to take a short cut across the park, but get lost. Their names fill out the two missing letters from the word Lucifer. Eddie climbs a tree for a better view, but is startled by a bat, falls, and is injured by landing on a horn, which Louie refers to as possibly belonging to a deer. Louie leaves him to get help. Meanwhile, Mrs. Belial alone in her flat is seen eating the raw meat of a bird. Later she constructs a model of The Coven out of earth and foliage, and places tin foil figures are inside. It appears that she is doing a magic spell on those in the wood.  The biker picks off seven of the teenagers, including Eve, who has entered the wood after receiving a text asking for help. The fire tree reappears, and images of seven of the teenagers are shown being sucked into the tree. The name Lucifer on the ground of the coven is completed with the names of Louie and Eve, it is implied that Eddie is not taken by the biker and so survives. The film ends with the singing of the nursery rhyme.

Crayon Shin-chan: My Moving Story! Cactus Large Attack!
 Hiroshi is ordered to collect the fruit of cactus and is transferred to Mexico. So, Nohara family is forced to move to Mexico and live there. They  bid farewell to their acquaintances and the citizens of [[Kasukabe]] in tears. Shinnosuke heard that Mexican young girls are stylish and beautiful and became eager for this journey. On arriving at Madakueruyobaka city in Mexico, a new life full of anxiety, surrounded by unique neighbours awaits them. But Shinnosuke and Nohara family had no idea that flesh-eating killer cactuses are going to attack.  Now it is up to Nohara family along with the neighbours of Mexico to overcome this trouble.<ref name="ameblo"/><ref name="youtube2"></ref><ref name="eiga"></ref>  In Mexico, in the town of Madakueruyobaka (fictional place), a new species of cactus was discovered. From the bud of the cactus, delicious and sweet honey could be made. Futaba Shouji, the company where Hiroshi worked, had put an eye on this. The company saw this as a business opportunity; it wanted to import and sell this commodity in Japan and outside. So, the company decided to open a branch office in Madakueruyobaka. Hiroshi was made the president of the Madaukeruyobaka branch, and was ordered transfer to Mexico.  Hiroshi had initially decided to go alone. But his wife Misae strongly opposed this. She argued that it would hamper the growth of their children, and said that a family is useless if it is not together. So it was decided that Hiroshi would move to Mexico with his family together.  At Futaba Kindergarten, Miss Yoshinaga announced that Shinnosuke would be leaving Kasukabe and moving to Mexico, which shocked everyone. All the Kasukabe Defense Group members expressed sorrow, except Kazama-kun who pretended that he's not sad and remained calm. Ai-chan, who has a crush on Shin-chan, cried for him.  Shinnosuke was at first unhappy, as he would be separated from Nanako. He said that, "I will remain in Kasukabe. I shall marry Nanako and live in Kasukabe". But when Shinnosuke was told that Mexican girls are beautiful and glamorous, he decided to go.  Nohara family packed their belongings, and their house appeared empty. They felt sad and nostalgic for leaving their house full of memories. Their luggage was transported before their actual departure.  On the day of leaving, all the people of Kasukabe came together to bid farewell to the Nohara family. The Kasukabe Defense Group had come with a KB (Kasukabe Boueitai) badge, and gave it to Shinnkosuke. They said that, "Wherever in the world you go, if you have this badge, you shall remain a Kasukabe Boueitai member". All members except Kazama-kun had arrived. Even the Saitama Red Scorpions, who considered Shin-chan a nuisance, had come. The Nohara family took a taxi to Kasukabe station. From the station, they boarded a train to the International Airport. When the train moved, in the middle of a dry river, Kazama was seen running behind. Shinnosuke and Kazama both called each other's names, with tears, and Kazama still running behind the train. Finally they lifted their KB badge together and waved goodbye.  At the airport, Hiroshi was amazed at the speed of the airport crew. Huge aeroplanes could be seen landing and taking off. They boarded their flight to Mexico. They finally arrived at Mexico. They stayed at the seaside resort, and took a long-distance bus to Madakueruyobaka. On reaching, they saw that it is a small and remote town, cut-off from the big cities, and isolated. From there, they meet José, the only employee from the Futaba Shouji's Mexico branch. José couldn't speak Japanese, except for few words and phrases. From his dialogue "zenzen daijoubu" (totally fine), Hiroshi and others mistook that he is fluent in Japanese. He took them to their new house. In the pamphlet given by the company, the house looked gorgeous and nice. But when they reached there, they saw that the house was only halfway made with brick walls and windows, looking tattered. They had to accept it, looking at the body language of José.  Nohara family begin their new life in Mexico. They quickly adapted to the surroundings. They adjusted to Mexican food, which was very different from their own Japanese food. They learnt Spanish, so as to be understood by the locals. They even wore the traditional Mexico attire. Shinnosuke went to the local kindergarten. The teacher Carolina was a beauty having a nice body. Shinnosuke was delighted and fell in love with her.  On the way, Shin-chan encountered a girl who was always busy with her smartphone. When he spoke to her, she ignored him and said, "Don't touch my phone, you potato-head". Shinnosuke named her "Sumaho-chan", though her real name was Fransisca. The family also encountered two interesting locals. One was Nene Rodriguez, a masked professional [[Luchador]] wrestler. The other person was Mariachi, a man who loved singing and always played the guitar.  This town, in the old days, was poor in industry and many people had left in search of work. But thanks to the cactus, the town seemed to escape from crisis. The Mayor wanted to further develop the town and attempted to harvest and sell only to the locals. When Hiroshi met the Mayor to negotiate, he refused. He said that many outsiders are attracted to the sweet nectar of the cactus. He refused to sell the cactuses or permit business. Meanwhile, in the square with the new cactus, a cactus festival was held. Shinnosuke wanted to dance with the kindergarten teacher Carolina, so he insisted Hiroshi to take him to the festival. Everyone in the festival was having a nice time.  There was a huge cactus which was about to bloom. The people including the Mayor were waiting for it to flower. But immediately after blooming, it turns into a giant killer cactus. From this giant Queen Cactus, small killer cactuses were generated. They started swallowing the people one after the other. All the terrified people started running, with the cactuses chasing them and eating them up. The town was getting destroyed. The cactus researcher, Ikegamino, said that cactuses have a strong regenerative power and it would be difficult to destroy them.  Nohara family including some residents, fled to one of the nearby bars. Hiroshi suggested that they should run out of the town, but no one cooperated fearing that they would be attacked by cactuses. At the bar they drank cola; there was no milk for Himawari. So Hiroshi decided to get some from the closest supermarket. Sumaho-chan accompanied him, in order to get a charger for her smartphone. But when they returned, the killer cactus also reached the bar and started eating people. So they had to escape again. Meanwhile, their dog Shiro was left behind in their house in the town. Shiro bravely saved some stray dogs from the cactus attack.  Hiroshi bought a bus from the bus stop and the residents boarded it. But they got eaten up even on the way. The person who were alive were the Nohara family, the Mayor, Carolina, Fransisca, Nene Rodriguez, Mariachi and the Nihon Erekiteru Union. The Nihon Erekiteru Union is a comedy group of Japan, consisting of Hosogai-san and Akemi-chan. Hosogai-san was an officer and Akemi-chan was Chibikko. On the bus, they both got soon eaten up by cactuses. Chibikko said her famous lines "Dame yo, Dame Dame" (No, no), before getting eaten. The rest fought with the cactus. The bridge which lead out of the town was occupied by killer cactuses, so they had to turn back. Shinnosuke discovered that cactuses hit people by responding to sound. But soon the bus driver got eaten up and the bus crashed onto a mountain.  At the suggestion of the Mayor, the survivors escaped into the Cactus amusement park nearby. The park was still under construction. There was no food available. So they decided that they had no choice but to leave the town. But the Mayor was strongly opposed to this. They discovered dynamite in the prefabricated hut for construction workers. They made a plan to blow up the cactus in the town. The Mayor was again opposed to blow up cactus in the town. So they decided to blow the cactus outside the town. They tied dynamite to a vehicle called "Cactus Car", and from the nature of cactuses reacting to sound, the strategy was to take the cactus out of the town and blow them across the bridge. When the cactus followed the vehicle, a fruit of the cactus fell down. The tempted Mayor went to pick up the fruit but fell down and by mistake changed the direction of the vehicle. As a result, the vehicle blew up on the bridge itself. Thus, the only exit of the city was collapsed.  The cactus started attacking again. In order to escape, Hiroshi and Misae wandered. Shinnosuke and Mayor were left together. They planned to go back to the town to get food. The Mayor talks about the reconstruction of the town to Shinnosuke. According to him, Madakueruyobaka was a poor countryside town and he grew up in this town. Now since many people have left, the town is deserted like nothing. So he intends to use this new cactus species to revitalize the town.  Shinnosuke ate the food that was passed from the Mayor and wanted to have a pee. But it was forbidden by Mayor's law to stand and pee on the roads. So, he had to go into the fields to pee. While peeing, a small killer cactus came near him. Shinnosuke peed on the cactus. To his surprise, the cactus got wrinkled and died. He wondered if pee was the weakness of the cactus. He told this thing to the Mayor, who was still busy thinking of his revitalization plan. Then they all realized that the weakness of cactus is water.  They decided to defeat the killer cactus using water. But there was shortage of water in the city. At the suggestion of Carolina and Francisca, they decided to use the water of the water supply tank on Chichideka mountain. The Mayor was again opposed to use the water from the tank, but had to give up this time. He let out his anger on Sumaho-chan. Hiroshi's plan was to inject water into a playing balloon called "Sabo-chan", and throw it at the Queen Cactus.  The action started with the day after sunrise. The "Madakueruyobaka Defense Group" was formed. The Queen Cactus had grown into a huge monster. They were likely to be attacked during water injection, so someone had to play the role of decoy. Mariachi was chosen as the decoy and he asked help from Rainbow Kamen in fear. In their dedication, water was able to get filled in the Sabo-chan balloon. But suddenly the Queen Cactus which was stationery began to move, and attacked Mariachi and Rainbow Kamen. The Mayor could see his town getting destroyed. In order to help Mariachi and Rainbow Kamen, the hitherto uncooperative Mayor himself became the decoy. While he was busy distracting the cactus, Hiroshi rolled the water-filled Sabo-chan balloon down the mountain and it was thrown at the Queen Cactus. The balloon was supposed to be burst by the thorns of the cactus and water was supposed to spout. But, the Queen Cactus guarded the balloon with its tentacles which had no thorn and it didn't burst.  So, Shinnosuke took out the needle of the KB badge which he was wearing. Kazama-kun had made the needle as a safety pin of the KB badge. Shinnosuke had almost forgotten about its existence; and it proved to be very helpful at the right time. Then Shinnosuke ran with the needle in hand, jumped and pierced the balloon with it. The balloon got burst, with water spouting all over. The Queen cactus got exhausted, was defeated and got disappeared. Also, all  people which it had swallowed were alive and came out. The botanist Ikegamino gave the reason that carnivorous plants take time to digest the things they eat.  Peace returned to town and the Cactus Festival resumed. Shinnosuke was able to dance with Carolina which he had been waiting since long. The species of new cactus was never seen again. So, the Mexico branch of Futaba Shouji was shut down, and Hiroshi was recalled back to the headquarters in Japan. Everyone happily enjoyed at the Cactus Land amusement park.

Creed (film)
  In 1998, [[Adonis Creed|Adonis "Donnie" Johnson]], the son of an extramarital lover of former heavyweight champion [[Apollo Creed]], is serving time in a [[Los Angeles]] youth detention center when Creed's widow, Mary Anne, visits and offers to take him in. In 2015, Donnie resigns from the Smith Boardley Financial Group to pursue his dream of becoming a professional boxer. Mary Anne vehemently opposes his aspiration, remembering how her husband was killed in the ring against [[Ivan Drago]] thirty years ago. Donnie auditions at the Los Angeles's elite Delphi Boxing Academy, managed by family friend [[List of Rocky characters#Tony_"Little_Duke"_Evers,_Jr|Tony "Little Duke" Evers Jr.]], the son of Rocky's trainer [[Tony "Duke" Evers]], but is turned down. Undaunted, Donnie travels to [[Philadelphia]] in hopes of getting in touch with his father's old friend and rival, former heavyweight champion, [[Rocky Balboa]].  Donnie meets Rocky at Rocky's Italian restaurant, Adrian's, named in honor of his [[Adrian Pennino|deceased wife]], and asks Rocky to become his trainer. Rocky is reluctant to return to boxing, having already made a one-off comeback at a very advanced age despite having suffered brain trauma during his career as a fighter. However, he eventually agrees. Donnie asks him about the "secret third fight" between him and Apollo just after Apollo helped Rocky regain the heavyweight title, and Rocky reveals that Apollo won. Donnie trains at the Front Street Gym, with several of Rocky's longtime friends as cornermen. He also finds a love interest in Bianca, an up-and-coming singer and songwriter.  Donnie, now known as "Hollywood Donnie", defeats a local fighter, and word gets out that he is Creed's illegitimate son. Rocky receives a call from the handlers of world light heavyweight champion "Pretty" Ricky Conlan, who is being forced into retirement by an impending prison term. He offers to make Donnie his final challenger—provided that he change his name to Adonis Creed. Donnie balks at first, wanting to forge his own legacy. However, he eventually agrees.  While helping Donnie train, Rocky learns he has [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]. He is unwilling to undergo [[chemotherapy]], remembering that it was not enough to save Adrian when she had [[ovarian cancer]]. His diagnosis and the fact that his best friend and brother-in-law [[Paulie Pennino]]—Adrian's brother—has now died in addition to Adrian, Apollo, and his old trainer, [[Mickey Goldmill]], further force him to confront his own mortality. Seeing Rocky shaken, Donnie urges him to seek treatment.  Donnie fights Conlan at [[Goodison Park]] in Conlan's hometown of [[Liverpool]], and many parallels emerge between the bout that ensues and Apollo and Rocky's first fight forty years earlier. First, before entering the ring, Donnie receives a present from Mary Anne — new American flag trunks similar to the ones Apollo and later Rocky wore. Additionally, to the surprise of nearly everyone, Donnie gives Conlan all he can handle. Conlan knocks Donnie down, but Donnie recovers to knock Conlan down for the first time in his career. Donnie goes the distance, but Conlan wins on a split decision (just as Apollo retained his title by split decision against Rocky). However, Donnie has won the respect of Conlan and the crowd; as [[Max Kellerman]] puts it while calling the fight for [[HBO]], "Conlan won the fight, but Creed won the night." Conlan tells Donnie that he is the future of the [[Light heavyweight#Boxing|light heavyweight division]].  The film ends with Donnie and a frail but improving Rocky climbing the [[Rocky Steps|72 steps]] outside the entrance of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].

Crimson Peak
 In [[Buffalo, New York]], 1887, [[List of American heiresses|American heiress]] Edith Cushing ([[Mia Wasikowska]]), the young daughter of wealthy businessman Carter Cushing ([[Jim Beaver]]), is visited by her recently deceased mother's black, disfigured ghost who warns her, "Beware of Crimson Peak." In 1901, Edith ([[Mia Wasikowska]]), a budding author, meets Sir Thomas Sharpe ([[Tom Hiddleston]]), an English [[baronet]] who has come to the [[United States]] with his sister, Lucille ([[Jessica Chastain]]), to seek investors for his clay-mining invention. Unimpressed with Sharpe's previous failures to raise capital, Cushing rejects Thomas's proposal. Edith's mother's spirit once again visits her, bearing the same warning.  When Thomas and Edith become romantically involved, both Edith's father and her childhood friend, Dr. Alan McMichael ([[Charlie Hunnam]]), disapprove. Mr. Cushing hires a private detective, Mr. Holly ([[Burn Gorman]]), who uncovers unsavory facts about the Sharpes. Mr. Cushing bribes the siblings to have Thomas end his and Edith's relationship. Thomas however sends Edith a note explaining his actions. After Mr. Cushing is brutally murdered, Edith and Thomas marry and return to [[England]]. They arrive at Allerdale Hall, the Sharpes' dilapidated mansion, which is steadily sinking into the [[red clay]] mine it sits atop. While Edith is bathing, a red ghost watches her and lets out a loud roar. Edith turns around to find nothing was there. During this time she plays fetch with a dog. When he returns without the ball, she asks, "Where is it?" From down the hall, the ball rolls down towards her. Edith finds that Lucille is cold towards her. Much to Edith's confusion, Thomas is physically distant and their marriage remains unconsummated.  Gruesome red ghosts begin appearing to Edith throughout the mansion. To calm her, Thomas takes her to the local post office, where she discovers that Thomas had some connection to an Italian woman. They are snowed in for the night and finally make love. Lucille angrily lashes out after their return, frightening Edith. By the time Thomas mentions that the estate is referred to as "Crimson Peak", due to the warm red clay seeping up through the snow, Edith is growing weak and coughing up blood.  Edith explores the mansion and pieces clues together, discovering that Thomas previously married three wealthy women who were fatally poisoned for their inheritances. She realizes she, too, is being poisoned through tea, and that the siblings have had a long-term [[incest]]uous relationship, resulting in a sickly infant that later died. Lucille also murdered their mother after she had discovered her children's incest. Thomas inherited the family manor that, like many aristocratic estates of the era, is no longer profitable; the Sharpes are virtually penniless. The brother and sister began a "marriage and murder" scheme to support themselves  and finance Thomas' inventions.  Back in the United States, Alan learns what Mr. Cushing had uncovered about the Sharpes prior to his death: Thomas' multiple marriages and Lucille's time in a mental institution. He travels to Allerdale Hall to rescue Edith. When Alan arrives, Lucille demands that Thomas kill him. Thomas, who has fallen in love with Edith and wants to protect her, inflicts a non-fatal stab wound to Alan before hiding him. Lucille forces Edith to sign a transfer deed granting the Sharpes ownership of her estate and also confesses that she was the one who murdered Edith's father. Edith stabs Lucille and tries to flee. Thomas promises to help her and Alan escape. Lucille, jealous over Thomas falling in love with Edith, murders him, then pursues Edith. Aided by Thomas' white ghost, Edith kills Lucille with a shovel, and later, she silently says farewell to her husband's ghost before he vanishes.  In the end, Edith and Alan escape the mansion and are rescued, whereas Lucille becomes a ghost, doomed to stay alone in the mansion while playing her favourite piano, for all eternity. The beginning of the end credits imply that Edith has written a novel titled ''Crimson Peak'' based on her experiences.

 A supernatural thriller in which a group of college friends on a road trip find themselves fighting off dark forces at a remote farmhouse after a chance encounter with a strange little girl.

Five college students - Emily ([[Elizabeth Di Prinzio]]), Tyler ([[Jeremy Sumpter]]), Sean ([[Brett Davern]]), Hank ([[Chris Coy]]), and Amanda ([[Linsey Godfrey]]) go on a road trip. While stopping to get something to eat, they come across a young girl, Lucy ([[Harley Graham]]), carrying a doll named Jade. Lucy says she was with her grandfather, but she lost him and can't get back home with her parents by herself. The group gives her a ride to a farmhouse that's very out of the way. Emily takes Lucy up to the house to find it empty. Lucy takes Emily up to her room, where there are several dolls that have been broken in various ways.   The group decides they can't leave Lucy by herself, and soon, a truck drives up, carrying Lucy's parents, Val ([[Virginia Williams]]) and Wayne ([[Johnathon Schaech]]). Initially angry with the students, Lucy's parents invite them to eat, drink and smoke [[marijuana|weed]] with them while Lucy is in bed. Val goes to chop more firewood and injures her leg with the axe. Wayne chides her for not paying attention. Wayne takes Val to the hospital while Lucy stays with Emily and her friends.  The group goes searching for Amanda, who has shut herself in a bedroom and won't answer them, and also discover that Lucy is no longer in her room. They look for Lucy outside, and Sean encounters a figure that chases him. Terrified, Sean goes back to the others, and insists they leave, even though they haven't found Lucy yet. He breaks open the door to Amanda, and finds her seemingly suffering the [[seizure|effects]] of a drug overdose caused by a [[dilaudid|painkiller]] she stole from the bathroom earlier. Sean and Hank leave in the group's car to take Amanda to the hospital while Emily and Tyler stay behind. While driving, they see a girl standing in the road who appears to be Lucy. Sean swerves to avoid her, causing a crash that kills Sean and leaves Hank stuck in the car. Hank tells Amanda to go back to the house for help.  Crying, Amanda begins to run back to the house and falls into a pit containing several dead bodies, one of them being the girl who was chased at the beginning of the film. Meanwhile, Hank frees himself from the car and returns to the house. He gets a [[shotgun]] from the house and the three begin to experience supernatural occurrences inside, including a shadowy figure that causes Tyler to shoot Hank with the gun.  Tyler leaves the house to get help, and finds Amanda in the pit. He tries to pull her out before she is killed by an axe thrown into her face. Tyler turns to see Val and Wayne. Wayne uses a knife to stab Tyler and kicks him into the pit of bodies.  Emily also leaves the house, and is picked up in the truck by Val and Wayne. They return to the house and Emily declares that Hank has died from his injuries. Val and Wayne reveal their evil sides to Emily and attempt to harm her. Hank appears and cuts Val's throat, saving Emily. Emily manages to escape outside the house and into the barn, where she discovers many creatures in the appearance of children locked up.  Wayne arrives and knocks Emily unconscious and explains the reasons for his actions. In order to save Lucy's life when she was trapped in a burning building, he was tasked by an unknown entity into creating an army of demonic children by using the bodies of people like Emily. While he is focusing on the ritual, Emily awakens and sets him on fire and drives away in his truck. As Wayne is lying on the ground burning, an evil creature comes up out of his body ominously looking towards Emily.  A hysterical Emily floors the gas pedal and peels away.  Emily is still driving when the sun comes up.  The camera zooms into the back of the pickup truck where we see Lucy sitting.  Then a water color picture is shown that depicts a dark haired woman presumably driving and a drawing of a blond girl with what appears to be a hook for an arm before the screen cuts to black, leaving Emily's fate unknown.

Ella tells her that she hasn't bought her plane tickets yet because she wants to make sure Mallory is actually in love and happy with her decisions. Mallory responds by telling her she's happy in a fake voice. She hangs up with her sister and continues driving. A few minutes later, her car breaks down unexpectedly. She tries calling [[American Automobile Association|AAA]], but she has no service. She also tries doing some tricks under the hood of the car, but to no avail.  While Mallory tries changing her clothes near the back of the car, she spots a man, Christian (Teddy Sears). She quickly puts on a tank top and tells him her situation. He eventually gets her car started for her. She then says she would offer him a ride, but was in a rush. She starts to drive away but, out of guilt, stops and offers him a ride.  Along the way, he starts acting odd. He talks about how fate brought them together and how it was supposed to happen like this, assuring her that he is not flirting. He then tells her how she couldn't "deepthroat his huge cock". She then stops and tells him to get out. He pulls out a knife and tells her to drive.  She notices his seat belt is off and tries to kill him by speeding towards a guardrail near a curve. They crash violently. Mallory wakes up to find the car upside down. She unhooks her seat belt, but she can't get out. She notices her leg is caught and pinned between the seat, all bloody. She tries pushing out, but fails. Christian slowly wakes up and tells her she needs to get herself out of this one and leaves her. She tries honking her horn and screaming for help but no one can hear her.  Mallory slips on a hoodie and drinks the last bit of her water bottle. The following morning Christian comes back and eats and drinks in front of her. He tells her how this was supposed to happen and how fate is a funny thing. That night a bunch of rats come in and slather around her. She kills one of them and eats a strip of its meat and drinks her own urine. Christian comes back and tells her how he's holding a family hostage. He then gives her a saw. At first Mallory thinks he gave it to her to cut through the seat, but he tells her he doesn't expect it to and how if she doesn't cut off her leg she's going to die.  That night a huge rainstorm hits and Christian comes to say his goodbyes but she attacks him and throws his car keys outside to where he can't find them. A police car pulls up from the curve, he runs and tells the officer his car won't start. The officer tells him he'll give him a ride but hears Mallory's scream. The officer thinks he's imagining things and drives away with Christian.  As the car starts to flood, Mallory starts trying to cut her leg off, but barely makes a few superficial cuts before her leg comes free out of the seat due to the assistance of the flood. She makes it out and goes to the cabin where Christian says he was at. She witnesses him killing the police officer and sees he has killed the home owners, while keeping the daughter, Katie, hostage. She aims a gun she found and tells him if he moves, she shoots. He attacks Mallory as Katie runs out the front door. Mallory twists his nose and elbows his stomach before running. She hides under a table, he finds her and she gets up and runs. He smashes her into a mirror but she manages to keep him down on the ground long enough for her to run upstairs. Christian looks for her upstairs, but Mallory sneaks from behind a dresser, creeps behind him and pushes him off of a second-story balcony and he falls and crushes his leg into a bear trap. She limps downstairs and gives him his knife and tells him how fate really brought this together and she's going to give him the same chance that he gave her. Christian soon succumbs to his wound and dies. The final scene shows Mallory limping down the road with Katie as the front door of the house slams shut.

When Dusty decides to call it quits and leave on the day of Megan's father-daughter dance, his friend Griff goes to Brad and convinces him to fight for his family. Brad catches Dusty at a bar and tries to get him to come back. Dusty admits that he cannot handle the hard parts about being a father, and admires Brad for putting up with all the things that he has to go through. Brad says that all of the terrible parts about being a dad are worth it, because in the end he is doing it for his kids. This convinces Dusty to go to the dance, and he and Brad arrive together. There, they discover that the classmate who was picking on Dylan at school is a girl, and almost get into a fight with her father when Dylan physically retaliates. However, Dusty finally decides to follow Brad's lead on being a father, and instead quells the fight by starting a dance-off. Brad and Sara reconcile, and Dusty decides to stay and be a good "co-dad" to his kids.  Later, the whole family is happy; Brad and Sara have a new baby boy named after Griff, and Megan and Dylan have finally accepted Brad as their stepfather. Dusty, who now has a job as a Panda DJ and becomes wealthy through his work, has moved in across the street after building a castle there, and he and Brad are now friends. Dusty eventually remarries, to a woman named Karen who has a daughter, thus Dusty becomes a stepfather himself.

 In mid-1920s Copenhagen, portrait artist [[Gerda Wegener]] asks her husband, popular landscape artist [[Lili Elbe|Einar Wegener]], to stand in for a female model who is late to come to their flat to pose for a painting she's working on.  The act of posing as a female figure unmasks Einar's life-long identification as a woman, who names herself Lili Elbe. This sets off a progression, first tentative and then irreversible, of leaving behind the identity as Einar, which she has struggled to maintain all her life. This takes place as both Lili and Gerda relocate to Paris; Gerda's portraits of Lili in her feminine state attract serious attention from art dealers in a way that her previous portraiture had not. It is there that Gerda tracks down art dealer Hans Axgil, a childhood friend of Lili (whom Lili had kissed when they were young). Hans and Gerda's mutual attraction is a challenge, as Gerda is navigating her changing relationship to Lili; but Hans' long-time friendship with and affection for Lili cause him to be supportive of both Lili and Gerda.  As Lili's continued existence presenting as male becomes too much to bear, she starts to seek help from psychologists, but none yields any result, and, in one instance, almost leads her into being committed to an asylum. Eventually, at Hans's recommendation, Lili and Gerda meet Dr. [[Kurt Warnekros]]. Dr. Warnekros explains that he has met several people like her, who are physically male but identify as female, and proposes a new, innovative and controversial solution: male to female [[Sex reassignment surgery (male-to-female)|sex reassignment surgery]]. This would entail a two-part procedure that involves first removing Lili's external genitalia and then, after a period of recovery, fashioning a vagina. He warns Lili and Gerda that it is a very dangerous operation that has never been attempted before, and Lili would be one of the first to undergo it. Lili immediately agrees and, soon after, travels to Germany to begin the surgery.  Lili eventually dies of complications from the surgery. The film ends with Gerda and Hans on a hilltop back in Denmark, in front of the five trees Lili had painted. The scarf that Lili had originally given Gerda, and that had subsequently been given back and forth several times, is carried away on the wind, dancing.

Dark Summer (film)
 Daniel Austin (Keir Gilchrist) is a young man who has been placed under house arrest for harassing classmate Mona Wilson (Grace Phipps). Under the terms of his house arrest, he is not allowed visits from unaccompanied minors nor is he allowed access to his computer (which has been confiscated by the authorities) or the internet. As his mother is away on business, he is alone in the house. Daniel's parole officer, Stokes ([[Peter Stormare]]), explains that Daniel's monitoring tag will go off if he goes past the edge of the front lawn. If he does not retreat within five seconds, he will be arrested. Daniel mentions hearing of someone under house arrest who cut off their foot to get the monitoring tag off so they could flee to Mexico.  Despite the restrictions placed on Daniel, his friends Abby Feller and Kevin Dowdle come around and bring him a tablet so that he can access a neighbor's internet connection and Skype his mother. When he is about to Skype his mother, Abby contacts him instead. After a brief conversation, he receives an incoming Skype call from Mona Wilson, who kills herself on camera.  Following this incident, Daniel becomes more and more paranoid and keeps seeing Mona in the house. Daniel and his friends attempt a seance to contact the spirit of Mona. The idea is that by each holding pens, Mona will communicate with them. Instead, Daniel and Kevin stab Abby through the hand with their pens. She is then lifted up and dragged across the wall. Afterwards, we see the blood from her injured hand spells out 'Daniel' on the wall.  After more supernatural events, Abby and Kevin head over to the dead girl's house. They are looking for a personal item of Mona's they can use as part of a ritual to help her move on to the afterlife. When they arrive at the house, they find it empty. They break in and, guided by Daniel who has a blueprint of the house, they head to Mona's room which is bare apart from a blood-stained mattress (from Mona shooting herself). They realize, with Daniel's help, that there is a false wall at the back of a closet which leads to a secret room which contains a number of strange artifacts and a large number of photos of Daniel; Mona was stalking Daniel, not the other way around. One of the items they find has a strange symbol embossed on it. Daniel finds out what it is and uses the name of the symbol as the password to Mona's cloud account. There he finds a folder called 'Daniel' which contains a spell.  It turns out that Mona secretly had a crush on Daniel, and had been obsessivly stalking him for a long time. She put a spell on Daniel to make him fall in love with her. It worked, but he was too shy to contact her, so Mona used a second spell so that her spirit could enter into Daniel's body alongside his own spirit so they would be together. There are five steps to the spell, the first of which was Mona's suicide. They realize that if all the steps are not completed by Daniel, the spell will fail. Abby therefore takes the last step, hoping that this will break the spell. However, Abby has already unwittingly carried out the previous steps of the spell so performing the last step brings Mona's spirit into her body. While they are cleaning up after the failed seance, Abby kills Kevin and then cuts off Daniel's leg so she can remove his house arrest monitor and abduct him without notice. When Stokes visits, he sees the severed leg on the floor and just thinks Daniel has absconded, as he described when he was first fitted with the tag.  In a post-credits scene, Abby, still possessed by Mona's spirit, is seen driving Daniel out of town while he lets out muffled screams.

After experiencing a panic attack, Darling follows the man and finds out where he lives.  === Chapter 2: Invocation === Darling begins experiencing hallucinatory visions. Noises in the home lead her outside to the balcony where she finds a Latin proverb "Abyssus abyssum invocat" which means "Deep calls to deep" ([http://wordinfo.info/unit/2320 "hell calls hell" or "one misstep leads to another"]) scrawled into a wood panel.  === Chapter 3: THRILLS!! === Darling follows the man from earlier to THRILLS!!, a local lounge. They share drinks together before Darling invites him back to her house. The man mentions how the house is said to be haunted and rumored to have been a place where someone once tried conjuring the devil.

 Set between the events of ''[[Dead Rising 2]]'' and ''[[Dead Rising 3]]'', the story follows online reporter Chase Carter and his camerawoman Jordan as they cover the stories of the people inside of the walled-in quarantined area in the fictional town of East Mission, Oregon, as the government (running an organization called F.E.Z.A.—Federal Emergency Zombie Authority) attempts to contain a viral outbreak that turns people into ravenous zombies.  An anti-viral drug called Zombrex, that keeps the virus at bay, is being administered to those infected. When it becomes clear that the drug is no longer effective and a zombie outbreak purges the town and infects its inhabitants, Chase, Jordan, grieving mother Maggie, and survivor Crystal battle their way out of the city before it gets firebombed.  Throughout the film, it is revealed that the Army implanted bad Zombrex in a refugee center to start another outbreak so that the government can be allowed to plant government-mandated Zombrex chips on the infected to track them, framing F.E.Z.A. for giving bad Zombrex to the infected. The coin that Jordan gave to Chase to open a newspaper vending machine at the beginning came in handy when she placed evidence of the Army sabotaging the Zombrex inside the vending machine for him to find.  When General Lyons figures out that Jordan and Norton are aware of the Army's actions, he has his men capture them to cover up the truth. In the end, Chase and Crystal manage to survive and get out of city, and Jordan manages to get footage proving the Army's complicity in the new outbreak to Chase, who finds it in the newspaper vending machine; the same footage shows her being taken into custody by the U.S. government, who then implant tracking devices on people who are infected.

The Dead Room
 After a ghost scares a family out of their house, an insurance company hires three ghost hunters to determine if it is haunted. They include Liam, who handles their technological tools, skeptic Scott, and psychic Holly. At first, Holly senses nothing in the house, and Scott's tools measure no electromagnetic disturbances. After Liam sets up several cameras with sensors, they go to sleep. At 3am, the cameras pick up movement, which Scott later dismisses as a draft. As Liam and Scott discuss their previous cases, Scott describes his theory that low frequency sound can disperse a ghost, and Liam shows Holly footage of a chair rocking by itself. Scott admits that he can not explain the footage and says he wants to find a scientific explanation for the paranormal.  A loud noise wakes the ghost hunters at 3am the next night, and Holly says she sees a ghostly figure, which neither of the men can see. In the morning, Scott tells them nobody will accept their evidence, as it is too subjective. Although frustrated, Liam and Holly eventually agree, and the three go through each room, trying to make contact. Before going to sleep, they set alarms to wake just before 3am. That night, Holly sees the ghostly figure again, and it reacts aggressively, threatening her. Scott calms the others by telling them that there is no evidence a ghost has ever harmed a living person; all it can do is scare them. Holly, more shaken than the others, reveals she took the job to conquer her fear of ghosts.  During the day, Holly senses a presence and strong temperature change, which the others do not feel. Scott's EMF meter reads nothing, but he soon realizes he forgot to insert a battery. When he does so, it immediately begins reading a large disturbance. The reading suddenly goes dead at the end of the main hallway, and Holly agrees that there is no presence in the kitchen. This is reinforced when the ghost later chases them, and they take refuge in the kitchen. Worried that the attacks could turn dangerous, Liam and Holly argue they should leave the house. Scott, however, insists they stay to capture evidence of the paranormal. When they subsequently film a telekinetic attack by flying furniture, Scott again insists they stay, this time to test his theory. Liam, who owns their transportation, reluctantly agrees, overriding Holly's objections.  During the ghost's next appearance, Liam restarts the house's generator while Scott sets up his equipment. After the machine reaches its lowest frequency, the attack suddenly ends, and Holly admits that the ghost is gone. As the relieved ghost hunters pack up their equipment, Liam notices a strangely-cold corner in the kitchen. Upon further investigation, a hidden passage leads to another room. There, they discover the mummified remains of a woman. Overwhelmed by a paranormal presence, Holly is forced to leave the room, and the others call the police, who, after looking, say there is no body in the room. As the ghost hunters attempt to convince the police officers of their story, Holly is suddenly possessed and reveals that the first ghost was trying to frighten them off and protect them from the second, the woman. The second ghost quickly kills the police officers, then Scott. Liam saves Holly, only to be killed himself. As Holly flees the house, the ghost kills her. In the final scene the killer ghost finally shows itself and the credits roll.

Deathgasm
 Long after the death of his father, Brodie's mother is institutionalized at a mental hospital. The teenager is thus obliged to move into his uncle's place in Greypoint. Brodie is a heavy metal fan, which conflicts with Uncle Albert's orthodox Christian beliefs. His fellow high school students regard him as an outcast, which leads to bullying from other boys (including his cousin, David). Brodie's only friends are two "geeks" named Dion and Giles, both of whom spend most of their time playing role playing games. Brodie soon becomes acquainted with another heavy metal fan, Zakk, at a local record store. Shortly after, Zakk, Brodie, Dion, and Giles form a metal band called 'DEATHGASM'. To Brodie's surprise, the beautiful Medina appears to be interested in him and invites him to have ice cream with her. However, Brodie is too shy and misses the chance to kiss Medina by the end of the date.  Later, Zakk tells Brodie about the metal musician Rikki Daggers, who is allegedly living nearby. Zakk convinces Brodie to accompany him to an abandoned house, where he suspects Daggers to be hiding. After breaking in, they find Daggers sleeping inside, holding a record album. When Brodie and Zakk try to steal the album, Daggers wakes up and attacks. When he hears a noise in his house, he hands them the record and tells them to run away. Moments after Zakk and Brodie have left, a well-dressed man enters the house and kills Daggers. He appears to be part of a cult which is looking for "The Black Hymn," medieval sheet music with the power to summon demons. Since the killer failed to obtain the sheets of music, the cult's leader later has him beheaded.  At home, Brodie notices the sheets of music hidden inside of the record's cover. The band plays the song, as lights flicker in response. Brodie's Uncle Albert, who is outside, hyperventilates and starts to bleed from his eyes. Brodie senses that something is wrong, and abruptly stops playing his guitar before they manage to complete the hymn. The next day in school, Brodie translates the Latin writing on the old sheets of music. He finds out it reads: "The black hymn. Play it to invoke the demon.". On the way home, Brodie's cousin David lies in wait for him and beats him up violently to make him stay away from Medina, in whom he is also interested.  In the meanwhile, Medina meets Zakk by chance. She tells him that she could not find Brodie and asks him to give him a note. Zakk reads the note and finds out Medina wants to meet Brodie at the local park in the late evening. He does not pass it on to Brodie, but goes there himself and lies to Medina that Brodie does not want to see her. Then he puts his jacket around her shoulders and they kiss. Brodie suspects that playing the Black Hymn is somehow connected to dark forces. Due to the humiliation by David and his friend, he wants to take possession of these powers to take revenge and therefore calls the band together to play the hymn. After having played it, the stereo equipment explodes and all band members fall unconscious. After waking up, all four notice that something has changed. Brodie meets a strange and frightening being in the school's toilet, who threatens him and one of the teachers starts to bleed from his body's orifices and throws up blood on a student during a lesson.  In the evening, Brodie meets Zakk in a repair shop to tell him what happened where they are attacked by Zakk's father. The latter acts as if possessed, tears out his own eyes and then tries to kill them, but the two manage to defend themselves and kill him. Meanwhile, Dion and Giles also are attacked and nearly killed by a possessed, but Medina manages to save them by killing it using an axe. They decide to hide in the school's panic room and leave a note on Brodie's door to inform him about their whereabouts. Trying to find out what is happening, Zakk and Brodie meets with a fortune teller. She tells them they have invoked the demon Aeloth "The Blind One" by playing the hymn, and that the residents of town are now possessed by Aeloth's minions, which kill every human being in order to prepare Aeloth's arrival. By 3 AM, Aeloth will merge with the most evil human being present. Before she is able to tell them how to undo Aeloth's summoning, she is killed by two of the possessed.  Zakk is not interested in fighting Aeloth any further and decides to watch the town's doom from a nearby hill, but Brodie manages to convince him to help because he assumes the summoning will be undone by playing the Black Hymn backwards. They drive to Brodie's house to obtain the sheets of music. However, Zakk secretly removes the note stuck to the door by Dion, Giles and Medina and the sheets of music are blown out of the window by the wind. Suddenly, they are attacked by Brodie's uncle Albert and his wife Mary who have also been possessed, but manage to kill them using three dildos and a chain saw. In contrast to his parents, Brodie's cousin David has not transformed yet, but Brodie decapitates David anyway as he enters the room.. Having decided they will search the sheets of paper, Zakk and Brodie craft a few weapons and go after them.  In the meantime, the members of the cult have come to Greypoint to serve Aeloth. They meet the strange and frightening being which Brodie had met in the school's bathroom. It appears to be Aeloth's ambassador who promises the cult's leader that Aeloth will merge with him. In this moment, the leader is killed by his own mistress who then claims the lead of the cult. After having found all the sheets of notes, Zakk and Brodie go to the school building since they know there are amplifiers which allow them to play the hymn backwards. There, they meet Dion, Giles and Medina. As Brodie notices Zakks jacket in Medina's bag, Zakk's lie is revealed. Zakk tells Brodie he is not interested in Medina but simply wanted to have some fun to which Brodie responds with a punch to Zakk's face. A fight ensues between the two, which Zakk manages to win. He then decides to leave town. Moments later, the remaining four are taken into custody by the members of the cult and brought into the house of Rikki Daggers in order to serve as sacrifice for Aeloth.  However, Zakk feels remorse for his friends and returns to them. He manages to free them and they attack the cult during their ritual for Aeloth. Brodie starts to play the Black Hymn backwards while the others defend him from the attacks by the cult members. In this fight, most of the cult members as well as Dion and Giles are killed. Brodie does not manage to play the hymn entirely before 3 AM, so Aeloth is able to enter the cult leader's body. Zakk then kills her, but since he is the most evil person amongst the remaining, Aeloth then takes possession of his body. Brodie realizes it's too late to complete the hymn, so instead he just plays heavy metal straight from his heart. The power of the music causes Zakk to collapse and temporarily transform back into his human body, but the respite is brief as Zakk can feel the demon trying to regain control.  Zakk then urges Brodie to kill him in order to prevent the demon's resurrection, which Brodie eventually does.  A few months later, Brodie and Medina are a happy Death Metal couple in Greypoint. The scene ends with a message from Zakk to Brodie which the latter hears through his record player. Zakk is now in hell, and he and Brodie have a friendly chat through the record about what hell is like.

Demonic (film)
 A violent slaughter occurs in an abandoned house in [[Louisiana]] where three college students are found dead. Detective Mark Lewis ([[Frank Grillo]]) examines the crime scene and finds a shocked survivor, John ([[Dustin Milligan]]), before calling reinforcements. Several police cars then arrive at the house alongside an ambulance with psychologist, Dr. Elizabeth Klein ([[Maria Bello]]). She talks to John, who tells her that a [[seance]] performed in the house called the attention of many spirits, including one he identified as his mother, and that two of the group members - his pregnant girlfriend, Michelle ([[Cody Horn]]), and her ex-boyfriend, Bryan ([[Scott Mechlowicz]]) - are still missing.  The following scenes consist of two interlaced plots: one shows the interrogation of John by Dr. Klein and the investigation of videotapes found in the house by police officers, and the other shows the actual events (often filmed by a camera) that John and the five other visitors of the house experienced, including several paranormal phenomena.  Bryan is later found alive but runs away from the police, ending up cornered in a store. John hears the news on the police radio and, in a fit of rage, grabs a radio, shouting at Bryan to tell where Michelle is. Bryan begins to act strangely while John almost goes into cardiac arrest. Elizabeth screams for Mark to stop Bryan before he kills John, wherein Mark promptly shoots Bryan dead.  Mark returns to the house and discovers a secret area where he finds Michelle.  As the paramedics are rolling her on the stretcher, Elizabeth discovers that John killed everybody at the same time that Detective Mark finds John's lifeless body hanging.  As it turns out, the "John" that Elizabeth was interrogating was the devil, who elaborates on the events that transpired - the seal the group found in the living room is what bound him to the house, John's mother was supposed to be the vessel of his escape, his possessing John, killing everybody and that he needs to cross the seal - in order to set himself free.  He then vanishes just as Michelle is wheeled out of the house.  The film concludes with Michelle in the ambulance showing a sinister figure moving in her belly.  
Demolition (2015 film)
 Davis is a successful [[investment banker]] at a firm founded and run by his father-in-law Phil. His wife, Julia, is driving them when they are struck by another vehicle, killing Julia. Recovering in the hospital, he attempts to purchase some candy from a [[vending machine]] which malfunctions. Davis drafts a complaint to the vending machine manufacturer that includes some venting of his personal experiences. This leads to a series of anonymous conversations with a customer service representative, Karen Moreno, in which they end up sharing details of each other's life burdens.  Karen appears to be the only one he talks to, though tells his stories in an understated and unemotional style.  He brings this same unemotional process to work, which he has returned to much earlier than anyone expected.  Davis does tell one other person, a fellow commuter train rider that he realizes that he didn't love Julia because he doesn't feel "...sad, or pain, or hurt...".  Davis' changing emotional state causes him to behave erratically. He notices that he is being followed by a green [[station wagon]]. The only thing Davis seems to connect with is trying to understand what's inside things, using a small toolkit to dismantle his household appliances, his work computer, a bathroom stall&mdash;eventually telling Phil that he has an urge to dismantle a 120-year-old grandfather clock in Phil's office.  Karen follows Davis, talking with him on his commuter train without revealing her identity. She mistakenly leaves some identification, and Davis is sufficiently moved to track her down at home, where she lives with her boyfriend and boss, Carl, and her 15-year old troublemaker son, Chris.  When Carl goes on a long business trip, Davis bunks at her house, where they develop a deep [[Platonic love|platonic]] friendship. Chris initially dislikes Davis, but later grows not only to like him but to help Davis cope, while Davis becomes his mentor in return.  Davis joins his in-laws in funding a foundation in Julia's name that will award an annual scholarship; during interviews, Davis behaves disrespectfully towards one of the award candidates, and Phil asks him to sign a transfer of his beneficiary rights in Julia's $2.6 million life insurance policy, to the scholarship fund in her name. Davis purchases demolition tools from a hardware store (and, later, a bulldozer) and, with Chris' assistance, destroys his house. When Davis finds an ultrasound of Julia's from the previous year, he is devastated that she failed to inform him.  A climactic night impacts everyone. Davis brings Karen to the party for the scholarship winner, greatly troubling Julia's parents. A young man makes an inappropriate advance on Karen, and she later laughs out loud when he is introduced as the scholarship winner. Davis announces to everyone that Julia had been pregnant and kept it secret. Julia's mother tells him his wife was seeing someone else, and the child was not his and she took her to get an abortion. Returning to Karen's house, Davis finds Carl has returned and is reading the letters Davis wrote to Karen. Carl beats on Davis, which pales compared to the homophobic swarm beating that Chris receives after coming out as gay.  Davis visits his wife's grave and the green [[station wagon]] arrives and a man carrying flowers gets out of the car. He is Michael, the driver of the car that killed Julia. Davis forgives Michael and he experiences flashbacks of his wife and him together and he finally cries, bringing closure. He realizes he loved his wife.  Davis has turned a corner.  He reconciles with Julia's parents, asking Phil to contribute to refurbishing a [[carousel]] &ndash; destined for demolition &ndash; as a memorial for Julia.  Davis receives a letter from Chris saying that he is recovering from his beating, his mother has left Carl, and Davis must be at [[Chelsea Piers#Pier 54|Pier 54]] at a particular time, which results in Davis witnessing the demolition of some waterfront buildings across the [[North River (Hudson River)|Hudson River]]. Chris watches Davis through binoculars from a nearby vantage point.

Srinivasan alias Srini ([[Arulnithi]]) is involved in a platonic relationship with Jillu ([[Jangiri Madhumita]]), a married woman, in return for money. Out of false bravado, the four friends decide to visit a dilapidated mansion in De Monte Colony, which is rumoured to be haunted. They sneak into the house and get separated in the darkness and have a chilling and forgetful experience, although all of them manage to come out seemingly unscathed.  The next day, the four men go to an [[Astrology|astrologer]] ([[M. S. Bhaskar]]) for their future. Three of them get their thumb prints and their future predictions done whereas Sajith is told the astrologer will predict his future later, as he does not have the corresponding paraphernalia. They return home, and everything seems to be normal and Sajith goes to bed. But while Srini is driving his bike, he gets a phone call from the astrologer, who wants to discuss an important matter, but Srini is unable to hear the details, and the call gets dropped. When Srini reaches the astrologer's residence, he finds him dead.   Some time later, the friends are curious to know the story behind De Monte Colony, so Raghavan narrates the story. Years ago, the area was a colony of the Portuguese business tycoon Lord John De Monte, who owned almost half of Chennai. He wishes to gift his wife, so he orders a special necklace as a gift for his wife's birthday. Soon after his wife becomes mentally ill. He informs the situation to his son via mail, and consequently learns about the death of his son. A depressed De Monte wants to return to Portugal and travels to Calcutta to sell his properties in India before leaving.   When De Monte returns after five months, he learns that some orderly working in the house has raped his wife, leaving her pregnant. He further requests a doctor to treat his wife within the confines of the house, but the doctor refuses, citing hospital laws. Taking this as a mark of disrespect, De Monte kills the doctor and all his servants over lingering doubts as to who had raped his wife. Angered by this, the locals set fire to the house and a disturbed De Monte shoots what seems to be gas cylinders; the ensuing explosion kills everyone within the house including De Monte. Seemingly, a curse is set on the diamond necklace such that whoever tries to steal it will be killed, and the stolen necklace will return to De Monte's house in any way.  Raghavan reveals that he had stolen the necklace in the hopes that it could be sold for money. Eerie things begin to happen in their room&nbsp;– the TV does not switch off and, instead of the DVD that they had inserted, plays their own conversations where the death scenes were played. The power goes off, Srini contacts the [[TNEB|electricity board]] for power help. Srini then adds about what happened to the astrologer. They play the [[Call-recording software|call record]], in which the astrologer reveals that Sajith has already died the last night. They all turn towards Sajith who is still sleeping.  The windows and doors do not open; the friends' cries for help are never heard outside. They take an [[ouija]] and ask some dreadful questions, then realise that no-one will return alive. One by one they turn up dead with Raghavan dying first and Vimal next. Srini suddenly discovers out a way to escape the room and runs towards a nearby tea shop, only to find that no-one can hear him; he realises he has become a ghost after dying when he attempted to jump out of the flat. Later, he witness the necklace being carried by Sajith, returning to the De Monte Colony House.  
Demon (2015 film)
 Piotr (Itay Tiran), who has been living and working in England for many years, and Zaneta (Agnieszka Zulewska), a Polish lady, are to be married; they had met only over the internet, but he knew her brother. Piotr speaks Polish awkwardly, remembering more from his ancestors than from personal experience. He moves into a run-down large rural estate previously owned by Zaneta's grandfather. While digging in the yard with a backhoe right before the wedding, he finds a skeleton, which at first he keeps quiet about. He is increasingly haunted by the vision of a woman in a wedding dress - Hana. During the wedding reception this vision draws closer and closer to him, he has apparent seizures, and is eventually possessed by Hana, the woman in the dress. Zaneta's family is well-to-do, and they want to keep his breakdown quiet from the rest of the wedding guests, so they distract their guests with vodka and loud music while locking Piotr in the basement, first with a doctor, then a priest. Finally, the "teacher" (Wlodzimierz Press, who appears to be the only surviving Jewish resident of the town pre-war), realizes Piotr is speaking Yiddish, and that he is possessed by the spirit of Hana, a lovely Jewish girl he knew before the war who suddenly disappeared. The film is a re-telling of a classic dybbuk story and also an allegory for Polish-Jewish relations before and after the war. It is implied that Zaneta's grandfather may have gotten rich in part by "possessing" this property once its former Jewish residents were gone.

Detective Conan: Sunflowers of Inferno
 At an exclusive [[auction house]] in [[New York City]], a painting recently found in [[Arles]] is up for bids. It had been examined by various experts and declared to be one of [[Van Gogh|Vincent van Gogh]]'s "[[Sunflowers (Van Gogh series)|Sunflowers]]", similar to a masterpiece thought to be destroyed during a U.S. air raid in Japan during World War II.  [[List of Case Closed characters#Jirokichi Sebastian|Jirokichi Suzuki]], accompanied by his niece, Sonoko fights off all contenders with a $300 million bid. At a press conference, he announces his plan to gather all seven of the known Van Gogh's Sunflowers paintings around the world for a grand exhibition. The venue would be a purpose-built gallery in Japan known as "Lake Rock", which boasts of iron-clad security and protection of the art pieces against fire, damaging humidity, sunlight, etc. The announcement is broadcast live worldwide, watched by Conan and Haibara.  Jirokichi also announces the engagement of seven specialists, whom he called the "Seven Samurai", to oversee the exhibition and protect the Sunflowers: # Keiko Anderson, a painting exhibition planning professional; # Natsumi Miyadai, a painting history professional; # Koji Azuma, a painting restoration and preservation professional; # Kumiko Kishi, a painting exhibition professional; # Taizo Ishimine, a painting transportation professional; # Charlie, a [[New York City Police Department|New York Police Department]] professional engaged to safeguard the painting out of New York; # [[List of Case Closed characters#Richard Moore|Kogoro Mori]], a Tokyo private detective engaged to protect the painting in Japan.  Suddenly, a card is thrown on the platform, which has the insignia of the legendary phantom thief, Kaitou Kid. Kid makes his presence known, causing mass panic by firing his card gun. Inspector Charlie chases Kaitou Kid and surrounds him, but Kid is still able to escape using a flare bomb. Much to Jirokichi and Sonoko's shock, Kudō Shinichi arrives from behind and offers his services to catch Kid.  Conan is particularly intrigued by Kid's sudden interest in masterpiece paintings, as his interests had previously been limited to gemstones. The painting is moved by airplane with the Seven Samurai, Jirokichi, Sonoko and Shinichi Kudō riding in it and set out for Japan. Ran, Conan and his friends, Kogoro, Inspector Nakamori, Agasa and others arrive at the Haneda airport to receive them. A bomb detonates near the cargo compartment of the plane and the recently purchased painting flies away. Shinichi jumps off the plane and saves the painting. It is revealed that Shinichi Kudo is none other than Kaitou Kid himself in disguise. The police and Conan spot Kid flying away with the painting, while the plane is in danger of crashing. This triggers chaos at the airport. Conan locates Kid on the terrace but Kid merely smirks and leaves. Conan finds out that Kid left the painting on the roof of a building. The plane safely lands and there are no casualties. The painting is retrieved by Conan who was mystified by Kid's actions as Kid never did any actions that could potentially harm anyone, and suspects a "fake Kid". The painting is examined and is found to be unharmed.  Inspector Charlie brands Kid as a ruthless murderer and terrorist, to which Sonoko objects (as she, like many others is a fan of Kid). Meanwhile, a Kid card arrives, saying he would be stealing van Gogh's second painting. Conan happenes to be at the art gallery where the second painting is, and as he went off when he heard news about Kid, he put Haibara in charge of the other kids. Haibara then resumes a talk with an old woman who came to the art gallery every day to see van Gogh's painting.  As the Seven Samurai are securing the painting, another Kid card appears, hinting that the painting was already stolen ahead of time and was replaced with a replica. Conan is surprised as Kid never lied about the time of his thefts. Tricked by it, Jirokichi orders the painting to be reexamined. Natsumi is unable to determine if the painting is real or fake and asks to take the painting to their workshop. One of the security guards puts a Kid card in Jirokichi's pocket and is reveals himself as Kaitou Kid. Kid steals the painting and is chased by Conan and Charlie. But Kid once more outwits them and escapes. In the new note, Kid demands ¥10 billion in cash as a ransom for the second painting within the next two hours, and Jirokichi accepts. This again puzzles Conan, because Kid had never demanded money and had always returned stolen goods. The money, in cash, is placed in an isolated room with only the art gallery's director present. Conan finds that the pressure in the room was increasing, as the water in a bottle in the room seemed to have increased, even though the director had drunk from it. Conan and Charlie storm the room, and Kid who appears at that room escaped, though the painting is intact. Kid had also anonymously contacted the media to witness the escapade. Jirokichi announces that the seven paintings would remain exhibiting on schedule, though Jirokichi is threatened with another Kid's card and [[Phosphine]]. Inspector Charlie resolves to show no mercy against Kid, and intends to kill him.  On the day of the exhibition, Kid once more impersonates Shinichi, and attends the exhibition. He leaves another Kid card with an enigmatic message. Conan discovers it and realises that it is a cryptic warning related to the [[Last Supper]] and its [[Judas Iscariot|betrayer]]. Conan understands that Kid is warning that one of the Seven Samurai is the culprit behind these incidents. As soon as Kid's presence is discovered, Jirokichi orders the gallery be evacuated and asks Inspector Nakamori to perform a background check on the Seven Samurai, while Charlie pursues Kid. Suddenly, the power system fails and a fire breaks out. Nakamori identifies that Koji Azuma had previously killed his twin brother when the newly discovered painting was recovered from Arles. Azuma confesses, but denies being the culprit in the present incident. In the fierce fire, two of the paintings are left to burn. Kid saves one of the paintings. Conan arrives to see Kid desperately trying to save the other painting whose security system has been jammed. Kid and Conan, with Ran's help, are able to activate the security mechanism and put the painting to safety while the gallery is collapsing.  In a desperate bid to put out the inferno, Kid detonates a bomb which breaks the water tank and douses the fire. Ran is knocked unconscious. Kid takes Ran and flees along with Conan. Kid tells Conan that he was aware of the culprit's plans to destroy the paintings when he hacked into her computer. Conan realises that Kid is innocent. The building threatens to collapse, so Conan requests Kid to save Ran and leave. Kid reluctantly agrees and breaks out of the building and leaves Ran near a lake. Jirokichi inspects the paintings and discovers that the second painting is missing.  Conan, using Shinichi's voice, then contacts everyone and concluded that Natsumi Miyadai is the true culprit. He reveals to everyone that all this while, Kaitou Kid was aware who the culprit was all along and was constantly thwarting her plans. In New York Kid had caused chaos so that Jirokichi would tighten the security of the paintings, preventing Natsumi to carry her plans. Kid had impersonated Shinichi and accompanied the group to Japan to ensure that the painting was safely transported. Natsumi had set off a bomb in the plane to destroy the painting, but Kid had rescued it and returned it. Knowing that Natsumi was also targeting the fifth painting, Kid had sent out a theft notice to once more tighten the security. Natsumi planted a fake Kid card to perform a re-examination of the painting. When Natsumi had suggested taking the painting to her workshop, Kid was forced to snatch it away, with the motive to enforce security. It was Natsumi who had sent the fake Kid card and phosphine to kill Jirokichi, to halt the exhibition and destroy the paintings. Natsumi had suggested putting fake sunflowers near her targets and had coated them with turpentine to act as incendiary. To stop Natsumi, Kid had sent out a message to Conan, hoping the latter would expose her. Natsumi wanted to destroy the two paintings as she was under the false assumption that they were fakes.  Kid and Ran are able to escape from the wreckage, but Conan is trapped inside as the water flooded the gallery. Ran is found by the police. Conan uses the ball to generate pressure differences to ensure the rock would explode, and goes along the water stream with the last painting. He falls unconscious for a brief moment before being able to resurface to be rescued by Kogoro.  Kid is cornered by Charlie. Kid tells Charlie that Natsumi had previously sent him an anonymous voice message, to steal the paintings for her. Being a master of disguise, Kid had identified her and was after her. Charlie asks Kid as to why the paintings concerned him. Kid tells him that during the first US air raid in Japan during World War II, the painting was saved from being burnt down by Azuma's grandfather, confirming that the painting was real. He requested a servant to save his lover from the fire. The servant had told Kid of this story and had asked him to save the paintings at all costs. The servant is revealed to be Konosuke Jii, Kaitou Kid's friend and assistant. The woman is revealed to be the old lady which Haibara talked to in the museum.  Charlie decides not to apprehend Kid, because despite being a thief, Kid is a man of honor. Kaitou Kid shows his respect to Charlie and mysteriously vanishes.

He starts his days with the old songs of a Punjabi Sikh pop singer Manjeet Manchala ([[Gippy Grewal]]), who has now stopped producing albums and disappeared mysteriously. As well as this, he has regular arguments with a Muslim man named Nawab Mehmood Nazim Ali Shah Khan Bahadur (Annu Kapoor) who happens to live in the same area as him. Dharampal later visits his late mother's bank vault to collect her belongings. He then finds adoption papers certifying he was adopted in 1960 and that his biological parents were Muslims. This shocks him, considering how much he dislikes Muslims, and he decides to keep this a secret. Eventually, he admits to Nawab that he is also a Muslim, and that he must find his real father in order to speak to him. They discover that his father is in critical condition due to old age, living in a senior home. The Imaam taking care of his father tells Dharampal that if his father saw that his only son has been brought up as a non-Muslim, it could cause severe damage to his health. Therefore, he tells Dharampal to learn how to become a true Muslim and come back to meet his father once he is ready.  With the help of Shah, he begins to learn the ways of Muslim people. However, the Imaam declines Dharampal's request to meet his father once again, claiming he is still not coming across as a true Muslim. Meanwhile, Dharampal's son falls in love with a young girl named Shraddha and in order to marry her, he must have her father accept him and his family.

A case is lodged against Dharampal for offending Muslims, and in the court, the Immam comes and gives character witness of how Dharampal detests Islam.

This reminds Dharampal that Manchala had disappeared years ago, and then matches the voices of Manchala and Neelanand, confirming they are the same person. He then crashes an event of Neelanand and reveals to a large audience how Neelanand Baba is actually a born Sikh and has been a fraud and characterless pop-singer with various cases lodged against him for adulterous relationships with many women. He gives a speech on how the religion a person follows should not matter as long as they are acting rightfully. Dharampal's family finally returns and his son is allowed to marry Sharaddha.

Among the Abnegation wreckage, Dauntless leader [[List of Divergent characters#Eric|Eric]] ([[Jai Courtney]]) recovers a five-sided box: each side has a faction symbol. Jeanine presumes it contains data from the city's founders and the means to end the Divergence problem. As only a Divergent is capable of opening the box, she orders the capture of all Divergents.  17 year old Tris ([[Shailene Woodley]]), Tobias Eaton ([[Theo James]]) (also known as Four), Peter ([[Miles Teller]]), and Caleb ([[Ansel Elgort]]) hide within the Amity compound. Soon after, Eric and his fleet arrive to test all the occupants for Divergence. Peter gives up the group's location as Tris, Four, and Caleb escape and board a train headed into Factionless territory.  Four reveals to the Factionless that his real name is Tobias Eaton, whom they have been searching for.  Four, Tris, and Caleb are given amnesty at the Factionless hideout where Tris and Caleb discover that the Factionless leader is Four's mother, [[List of Divergent characters#Evelyn Johnson-Eaton|Evelyn]] ([[Naomi Watts]]), who Four is still resentful towards for leaving him with his abusive father, Marcus. She suggests that Dauntless and Factionless should ally against Erudite, but Four declines. The next morning, the three leave Factionless for Candor to meet up with the remaining Dauntless; during the trek, Caleb tells his sister Tris that he cannot continue with them and goes in a different direction. Upon arrival, Tris and Four are arrested and brought before Candor leader [[List of Divergent characters#Jack Kang|Jack Kang]] ([[Daniel Dae Kim]]), who intends to deliver them to Jeanine. However, Four pleads for Jack to conduct a trial in Candor with the use of [[truth serum]]. During the trial, Four communicates his motives and is absolved. Tris tearfully admits her guilt in killing Will, which angers Christina, who loved him.  Candor is attacked by the Dauntless who have sided with Eric, and many people are shot with pellets of new simulation serum. Tris is captured by Eric who learns she has a Divergence reading of 100%, making her the perfect subject to open the box. Four arrives to save Tris with the Factionless allies and shoots Eric in the head for the murder of hundreds of people. Back at Erudite, Jeanine, frustrated that none of the Divergent subjects have survived the simulation trials required to open the box, is approached by Peter, who pledges his loyalty to Erudite, and suggests the best way to get Tris to surrender is by exploiting her humanity.  Back at the Factionless base, Four reluctantly agrees with Evelyn that war is inevitable and that they need to prepare. Jeanine activates the pellets, causing Christina, Marlene and Hector to repeatedly chant that Tris must turn herself in or more death will follow, as they step closer and closer to the edge of a tall structure. Tris and Tori then climb the sides of the roof and rescue Christina and Hector. However, Marlene plunges to her death. Overcome by guilt, Tris decides to turn herself in to the Erudites.  Arriving at the Erudite headquarters, Tris agrees to undergo the trials provided that the suicides cease. Tris overcomes four of the trials, however, when her vitals drop, Jeanine reluctantly halts the simulation to let her rest. Tris then discovers that they have captured Four. She fails the final trial and her vital signs cease. Her body is wheeled over to Four's cell so the latter can mourn, but when she's un-paralysed, Peter assists Four in overpowering the guards, revealing that he had faked her death by injecting her with a sleep serum. Tris is determined to open the box and unveil its message; she and Four head to the simulation room, while Peter returns to the control room to grant them security access.  Overcoming the final trial, Tris successfully opens the box. A woman explains that the walled city and faction system is actually an experiment they devised, that the Divergents are actually the success of the experiment, and that the world is waiting outside for them to return to humanity. Realizing she has lost all her power, Jeanine orders that the box be buried and that Four and Tris be executed. However, the Factionless army breaks into the simulation room to rescue Tris and Four. Jeanine and Caleb are arrested. The message is broadcast to the entire city. Tris is hailed as a hero by the masses, eager to explore the world beyond the wall. As Jeanine looks out from her cell, she states that there is no telling what awaits them beyond the wall. Evelyn tells her that she will never find out and kills her.

Don Verdean
 Don Verdean ([[Sam Rockwell]]) is a [[Biblical archaeology|Biblical Archaeologist]] that searches for items that can prove that the stories from the [[Bible]] are true. The film opens to what seems to be an old VHS tape showing Verdean's archaeological achievements, all of which have no substantial proof and are based on anecdotal evidence. It cuts to Verdean at a church giving a lecture on his iron shears which he believes were used to cut [[Samson]]'s hair. A man stands up and reads a letter from the [[Israeli Antiquities Authority]] that states that Verdean had no legal authority to be excavating in [[Israel]], that his actions were illegal, and any archaeological findings should be published in professional journals.   Verdean responds by saying [[Satan]] is at work and the Israelis are covering up the truth to prevent a bloodbath. Verdean proceeds to open his book to a page with him and another man. The other man he claims to be Nahum Ishalom, the spokesman for the Israeli Antiquities and author of the letter that the man just read. This causes the congregation to start clapping, including the man who read the letter but he still seemed skeptical. Afterwards at the meet and greet in the Church's lobby a man hands his assistant Carol Jensen ([[Amy Ryan]]) a business card from Tony Lazarus ([[Danny McBride]]) and says Lazarus wants to meet Verdean. Carol informs Verdean that Lazarus wants to meet him as they are loading their wares into their RV. Verdean tells Carol about Lazarus's conversion from being a sinner who was driving with a [[Prostitution|hooker]] when he got into a car accident and died 10 years prior, with Verdean stating Lazarus's soul left his body. Verdean then states God sent him back like a modern day [[Lazarus of Bethany]].   Lazarus then married the [[Prostitution|hooker]] and they started their own ministry. The next morning Verdean meets Lazarus at his Church where Lazarus introduces his wife Joylinda Lazarus ([[Leslie Bibb]]). Lazarus informs Verdean that Church attendance has been down and Lazarus needs a boost because of a new neighboring Church ran by an ex-Satanist that is taking all his parishioners. Verdean tells Lazarus he has found a salt statue of [[Lot's wife]] and Lazarus wants it. Verdean calls Boaz ([[Jemaine Clement]]) who is in [[Israel]] and tells him he needs him to ship the statue to him in the [[United States]]. Boaz has forgotten where it is but says he will find it and hangs up the phone. The shipment arrives but when they open the box, the statue inside looks like something with a [[penis]]. Everyone looks surprised and Lazarus states it does not look like the picture that Verdean had shown him. Verdean states that [[Lot's wife]] must have been a [[hermaphrodite]] which explains why she did not want to leave [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]].   Lazarus buys this but Verdean calls Boaz, extremely upset, and demands that Boaz send him the statue he had shown him earlier. Lazarus unveils the statue to a bewildered audience when a man stands up and claps. After the sermon Pastor Fontaine ([[Will Forte]]) shows up and asks to carbon date the statue, which Verdean declines stating that [[carbon dating]] is not reliable and Fontaine leaves. It cuts to Verdean and Carol at a diner eating and Carol tells Verdean about her son, who is in prison for growing [[marijuana]]. Later Lazarus tells Verdean he wants more artifacts. Verdean says he can find [[Goliath]]'s skull and Lazarus thinks this is a great idea. Verdean and Carol fly to [[Israel]] where they meet Boaz and start digging for the skull. [[Israeli Police]] show up and start yelling at them in [[Hebrew]] which Boaz attempts to translate. The police officer states that they need a permit to dig and if they do not fill the hole in they are all going to jail. Later, Verdean is speaking with Lazarus over the phone and Lazarus tells Verdean he needs the skull as soon as possible. Verdean then decides to steal the skull of a dead Israeli with [[gigantism]], by the name of Jonny Jerusalem, from his grave. Verdean then knocks out a rock sized hole in the front of the skull and tries to pass it off as being [[Goliath]]'s skull by burying it out in the desert.   The next day he brings Carol and Boaz to the spot where he buried it the night before. A man from a tour bus sees them dig it up and starts recording them and claiming it was Goliath's skull. Back at the hotel, Boaz confronts Verdean about the unlikelihood of them finding that so quickly. Boaz then sees Johnny Jerusalem on Verdean's laptop and accuses him of being a [[grave robber]]. Verbean bribes Boaz to keep his mouth shut and takes Boaz with him to the [[United States]]. Boaz keeps blackmailing Verdean in order to get Verdean to do what he wants, including the request for a night with Carol. Verdean asks Carol to meet up with Boaz because Boaz wants to convert to Christianity and they setup a date. Boaz picks up Carol for their date, precedes to ask her questions about the type of men she likes, and asks her to dance. After Boaz says inappropriate things about Carol's son, Carol slaps Boaz and storms out with Boaz yelling that Verdean promised him a night with her. Carol, upset with Verdean, tell Verdean that she quits. Verdean then goes to the dance club and punches Boaz in the face, knocking him onto the ground.  The next day they go to meet the man who Boaz hired, but has not paid, to falsify the lab results on Goliath's fake skull. Not having the $10,000, Boaz pulls a gun on the guy, kidnaps him, and they lock him in a storage locker. Verdean and Boaz start trying to create a fake Holy Grail in order to try and fool a Chinese, Christian, Billionaire who they are trying to con 1 million dollars out of. After several failed attempts, they steal a chalice from an antiques store. Verdean and Boaz pickup Poon-Yen ([[Steve Park (comedian)|Steve Park]]) at the airport and board a helicopter, heading to the "secret" location of the Holy Grail. They land wearing [[bulletproof vest]]s and take Poon-Yen through some caverns until they reach their fake [[Holy Grail]], which greatly impresses Poon-Yen who believes the farce. Poon-Yen is accidentally shot and they all end up at the hospital where Boaz pulls a gun on them and steals the briefcase of money from Poon-Yen's associate who is sitting next to Poon-Yen in the hospital bed.   Verdean tackles Boaz and then the briefcase starts to vibrate while they are wrestling on the ground. Inside the briefcase was a cell phone that Pastor Fontaine was calling and leaves a message saying the cops found the kidnapped lab technician with a GPS tracker Fontaine placed on Verdean and Boaz's car. Verdean and Boaz escape after taking off the GPS tracker and are pursued by the police. Boaz is captured and arrested while Fontaine taunts him as he is placed into custody and drives away. The cops then find Verdean at Carol's house confessing and apologizing to her for his crimes. The police take Verdean away and it cuts to 2 months later. A news woman is outside Fontaine's Church questioning him about misappropriation of Church funds in order to setup Verdean. Verdean was convicted of fraud, larceny, aggravated assault, and accessory to kidnapping. Verdean and Boaz end up in prison together and talk in the yard. Verdean notices a young man sitting alone at a table during dinner and asks if he has a mother named Carol, to which he replies "Yes". Verdean pats him on the shoulder before it cuts to the credits.

Downriver (film)
  James is a young man who suffers from epilepsy and has recently been granted parole from the juvenile detention centre in which he has spent the last eight years.  When he was ten, he drowned a little boy, Chris McCarthy, in a river at a caravan park, although the body was never found.  After being released, he returns to the caravan park in order to find and return the body to the grieving mother.  He moves into the old cabin he used to live in with his mother and befriends Damien, the boy next door.  James tells Damien that Chris had been his brother.  He is eventually joined at the park by his mother Paige and her new boyfriend, Wayne.  Paige tells Wayne that James is her nephew and that her son died.  Despite the fact that his family took out a restraining order against James, James is approached by his former friend Anthony. Anthony was with him when he killed Chris and gave evidence that convicted James, leading to animosity between them.  Anthony has turned into a lazy, drug-addicted hustler.  He tries to dissuade James from looking for the body, reasoning that the local wild dogs probably took it.  James refuses and in retaliation, Anthony seduces Damien.  James and Damien visit Mary, a local woman who keeps several dogs, to ask her about the possibility of the wild dogs taking the body.  She dismisses the idea and mentions that Anthony and another boy, Ray, killed one of her dogs a few years back.  Wracked with guilt, Ray came to her to confess.  James then visits Ray and asks him about the dog they killed.  Ray admits that he and Anthony were playing in the tunnels under the bridge with the dog until Anthony tricked the dog into jumping into a hole from which it couldn't escape.  This gives James the idea that Anthony hid Chris's body in the tunnels under the bridge.  James discusses his search with Paige.  She reveals that after the drowning, James had an epileptic fit and Anthony got him help, not leaving his side until many hours later.  This leads James to realise that Anthony could not have hidden the body.  James organises a fishing trip with Damien's family and Wayne near the bridge.  He sneaks off and explores the tunnels.  Though he finds the hole Ray mentioned, it is filled with water and he is unable to search it further.  When he returns to the others, Damien reveals that Chris didn't have any brothers and guesses that James was his killer.  He tells him to stay away from his family.  The stress causes James to have a fit in the water and he nearly drowns.  When they return to the park, Wayne reveals to Paige that he knows James is her son.  Finally James visits Amos, who owns the local shop and has been blackmailed by Anthony for many years.  Amos reveals that Anthony and his brother Joe once had a younger sister, Bettina, who suddenly disappeared one day and the family never spoke of her again.  In the meantime, Damien goes to Anthony's house.  Anthony is away so he talks to his father Gianni.  His attempts at conversation, relating a story Anthony told him about a drowned baby, raise Gianni's suspicions.  Gianni knocks Damien unconscious and Joe drives him away in the car.  When Anthony returns home later, Gianni beats him and questions him about what he has been saying about his sister, someone Anthony clearly doesn't remember.  James returns home to Paige and tearfully reveals what happened the day of the drowning.  Anthony, with vague recollections of Bettina, had asked James to 'steal him a sister'.  They had selected Chris, lured him away from his family, and played with him on the riverbank until Anthony started abusing Chris and pressured James to drown the boy before they got in trouble for their 'theft'.  Paige then remembers that although Anthony was there all evening, he did speak to Joe, giving Joe an opportunity to move the body.  Joe and Anthony then arrive and attempt to blackmail James into abandoning his search by beating Damien.  This makes James even more determined to bring the family to justice.  James and Damien escape to Mary's house, where they reconcile.  The next morning, James returns to the tunnels under the bridge with Damien and Mary, along with ropes and torches.  James climbs down into the water filled hole and eventually finds Chris's body, along with an even more decomposed body of a little girl, presumably Bettina.<ref></ref>

With the meeting going as planned, Malcolm leaves with a bag of cash but is assaulted by the school bully and company, quickly overpowering him and takes the bag. Desperate, he defends himself by pulling the gun, getting the money back and earning the bully's respect.  Returning to AJ's office for his interview, Malcolm tells Jacoby that he has sold the drugs but has left a trail leading to Jacoby. Unless Jacoby admits him to Harvard, Malcolm will transfer the Bitcoins to Jacoby's checking account, which will frame Jacoby and lead to his arrest. He then types his college application essay. He describes two students – Student A is a music geek that plays in a punk band and gets straight As, while Student B suffers in the hood and makes money in immoral ways. He then asks, "Which student do you think I am?"  Malcolm waits for Nakia at [[prom]], but she does not show at all. Later, Nakia meets Malcolm at his home and thanks him for helping her pass her GED, giving him a pass to [[Six Flags]] and kisses him on the cheek. He then goes inside and enters his room to find an [[College admissions in the United States#Acceptances and rejections|envelope]] from Harvard on his bed. He opens it and [[Fourth wall|looks at the audience]] before smiling.

Shortly after Huo An leaves to find reinforcements, the corrupt group member from earlier sends Chinese soldiers to murder Xiuqing and attack Wild Geese Gate. The legion is imprisoned in the non-Chinese trading city of [[Kroran]], where Tiberius has chosen to camp. Tiberius proceeds to murder Publius.  Huo An and the few loyal Chinese soldiers travel to Kroran, pretending to surrender, but once they are inside, they destroy the Roman legion's cages. Huo An breaks into Lucius's special solitary cell, but is unable to free him. A fire breaks out, whereupon Lucius calls out to Huo An to 'take me home', and Huo An shoots an arrow to kill Lucius before the fire gets him.  As Huo An's and Lucius's soldiers are surrounded, the armies of several other nations arrive and fight against Tiberius, including the Indians, Han, Uyghurs, and Turkics, all of whom are determined to preserve the Silk Road's safety. However, even their combined forces are unable to gain the upper hand. Finally, the envoys from earlier return with a massive host of Parthians, who had signed a special treaty with Publius's father and who intend to avenge his memory. Tiberius's soldiers lose their will to fight. Huo An challenges Tiberius to a duel and kills him.  Upon hearing about the bravery of Lucius's legion, the [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]] grants them the right to establish their own city, which they choose to name Regum. They accept Huo An as their commander, and Huo An, in turn, honors the deceased Chinese general by relocating the shrine to that city. As the centuries go on, the city fades from [[collective memory]]. However, in the modern day, a team of Asian American archaeologists stumble upon the site and uncover the dual Chinese and Latin inscriptions.  
Dragonheart 3: The Sorcerer's Curse
  In the 9th century in the north of [[Great Britain|Britain]], a druid circle foresees a "falling star" from the constellation [[Draco_(constellation)|Draco]], with Brude - one of the druids - summoning a [[Picts|Pict]] clan known as the "Painted tribe" to slaughter the druids and lead the clans to war against the southern kingdoms over [[Hadrian's Wall]]. A druid apprentice called Lorne escapes the slaughter of the druids.  On the Southern side of the wall, Gareth and a group of squires undergo their final tests to prove that they should be knighted. Gareth proves to be the best fighter, but fails to collect enough money from the peasants. Disappointed, his superior Sir Horsa refuses to knight him and tells Gareth that he owes him 100 crowns - after which Gareth will be given his knighthood. With nowhere to go, Gareth is taken in by a peasant couple who couldn't pay him. That night, a [[meteor]] falls to Earth on the North side of the wall - with Gareth stealing a sword from one of the knighted squires and going over the wall to find the meteor after been told by the couple that it would contain riches.  Eventually, Gareth finds the meteor - only for it to burst open and reveal a dragon with nine eggs. The dragon proceeds to attack the Painted tribe members that also tracked down the meteor, with Gareth saving one of the dragon's eggs despite been badly wounded by the clan warriors. Impressed by Gareth's mercy, the dragon shares its heart with him, saving Gareth's life. However, Brude uses a slavery spell called the Sorcerer's Curse on the dragon - rendering the creature powerless during daylight or by the light of a flame and meaning the dragon will be under Brude's control by the full moon – before claiming the dragon eggs.   Gareth is rescued by Lorne - who explains to Gareth about dragons and the bond he now shares with the dragon - before Gareth is introduced to the rebel leader Rhonu and the clans who oppose Brude, with the hope Gareth will get the dragon to fight for them. Meeting the dragon again, the dragon (who Gareth calls Drago) explains his purpose to raise the young dragons he has brought as friends to mankind. However, he also states that he needs help to retrieve the eggs as he cannot do it himself due to the curse. Gareth's first attempt fails, with him getting captured by the clan. Brude intends to kill him, but stops upon learning about Gareth's connection with Drago. With help from Rhonu and Lorne, he successfully escapes with the eggs.   Gareth convinces the group to head towards the wall, with Rhonu telling her uncle Traevor to gather the clans who oppose Brude. Travelling with Rhonu and Lorne, the trio are forced to go on foot after one of the eggs is accidentally destroyed. Along their journey, Drago tries to teach Gareth how to shadow-jump, although apparently fails. However, while trying to free a group of people captured by the painted clan, Gareth shows an act of valour – temporarily freeing Drago from the curse. The trio escape from Brude and the clan after Gareth sacrifices one of the dragon eggs and shadow-jumps to safety.   Before the group reach the wall, Gareth confesses to Drago that he isn't a knight and that the Southern side of the wall is a cruel place with no respect for the Old Code of [[King Arthur]] – although Drago still sees Gareth as a friend. Upon reaching the gate, Gareth, Lorne and Rhonu are arrested and the dragon eggs seized upon learning of the Painted clan heading towards the wall. At the full moon, Drago (now fully under Brude's control) and the Painted tribe attack, although Gareth and Rhonu escape with help from Lorne's magic. As Gareth interrupts the sale of the dragon eggs and battles Sir Horsa to protect them, his act of valour frees Drago – who aids both the soldiers and the northern clans led by Traevor. Gareth slays Sir Horsa, while Rhonu battles and kills Brude – although is fatally wounded herself. With Brude dead and Drago free, the remainder of the Painted tribe retreats.  Following the battle, Gareth tends to Rhonu – who is saved as one of the unhatched dragons shares its heart with her. Gareth becomes a knight and leader of the settlement, with peace achieved between the North and South as Hadrian's Wall is renamed the Dragon's Gate. Gareth and Rhonu finally express their love for each other as the baby dragon that saved Rhonu begins to hatch.  
The Dressmaker (2015 film)
 In 1926 in the [[Outback|Australian outback]] town of Dungatar, schoolboy Stewart Pettyman meets a violent death. Schoolgirl Myrtle Dunnage is blamed and exiled from the town by local police sergeant Horatio Farrat ([[Hugo Weaving]]).  Twenty-five years later, Myrtle, now an accomplished dressmaker and going by the name Tilly ([[Kate Winslet]]), returns to her hometown to find her house squalid and her mother Molly ([[Judy Davis]]) mentally ill. Unable to remember the events of Stewart's death, Tilly asks her mother, as she believes that day left her cursed. Molly remembers nothing about the incident.  At the local [[Australian rules football|football]] final game, Tilly turns up in a bright red [[Haute Couture|couture]] gown that distracts the Dungatar players. During the interval, Teddy McSwiney ([[Liam Hemsworth]]) confronts Tilly about her distracting dress, and Tilly agrees to change. After changing into a black but equally alluring outfit, the last quarter of the game begins, with the teams having swapped ends of the field. Due to this, the team from the nearby town of Winyerp are distracted by Tilly's dress, and Dungatar emerges as the winner. Later, Gertrude Pratt ([[Sarah Snook]]), the daughter of the owners of the town's general store, arrives at Molly's house to take up Tilly's offer to make her a dress for the upcoming footballers dance. Tilly agrees to make the dress in exchange for the truth about Stewart Pettyman's death. Gertrude reveals that Tilly had hidden from Stewart who had been bullying her, but she revealed Tilly's location in self-defence.  At the dance, Gertrude's dress is a huge success, and she uses it to capture the attention of William Beaumont ([[James Mackay (actor)|James Mackay]]). They later become engaged. All of the townspeople begin asking Tilly for extravagant dresses. Teddy pursues a romantic relationship with Tilly.  Sergeant Farrat confesses to Tilly that he exiled her because Stewart's father and town councillor, Evan Pettyman ([[Shane Bourne]]), blackmailed him with photographic proof that he is secretly a [[cross-dresser]]. Tilly and Farrat form a friendship over their shared passion for designer clothing. Noticing Tilly is regaining the favour of the townspeople, Councillor Pettyman recruits dressmaker Una Pleasance ([[Sacha Horler]]) to start a rival dressmaking service. This is initially successful, but when Gertrude hires Tilly to create her wedding dress, the rest of the townspeople return to Tilly, ruining Una.  Tilly bribes Farrat with a [[feather boa]] into letting her read her former schoolteacher Beulah Harridiene's ([[Kerry Fox]]) witness statement from the day Stewart Pettyman died. She becomes convinced Beulah lied in her statement for fear Evan would blame her for Stewart's death. Tilly tells Farrat this at Gertrude's wedding reception, but he remains convinced that Tilly killed Stewart, as everyone else in town had an alibi. He also reveals that Pettyman is Tilly's father. Tilly runs from the reception. Teddy chases after her after his developmentally disabled brother, Barney ([[Gyton Grantley]]), hysterically says Tilly "moved" when Stewart died.  Teddy takes Tilly to the schoolhouse, and tells her how Stewart died. Stewart had subdued her against a wall, threatening to murder her mother if she moved. He charged head-down at her, she moved aside at the last moment, and Stewart hit his head on the wall and broke his neck. Barney witnessed this from atop the town silo, but was afraid people would think he was lying. Tilly and Teddy go to his caravan and have sex. Later, they sit on top of the town silo. Teddy shows off by jumping into the silo. Unbeknownst to them the silo holds [[sorghum]], and Teddy asphyxiates as he [[Grain entrapment|sinks into the grain]].  Molly tells Tilly Evan knew about Tilly but never came by as she wasn't a son, and when Stewart died he had Tilly sent away to hurt Molly. She encourages her to use her dressmaking talents against the townspeople. While out in town, Molly suffers a stroke, and later dies. While Tilly and Farrat are holding a [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] for Molly, Beulah snoops around the house. Tilly drunkenly objects to the music, and throws the portable record player off the verandah, where it hits Beulah and injures her. Beulah is helped onto a train to Melbourne, ostensibly for treatment but really to be placed in an asylum.  Percival Almanac ([[Barry Otto]]), the town chemist who mistreated Tilly as a child, drowns in a pond at the back of his house. Almanac's wife Irma ([[Julia Blake]]) did not save him due to being under the influence of [[hash brownies]] baked by Molly. To prevent Tilly's arrest, Sergeant Farrat takes the blame. He is removed from the town by his superiors.  Tilly visits Marigold (Evan's wife) and reveals that her husband has been conducting numerous extramarital affairs. Marigold confronts her husband about his unfaithfulness, and subsequently cuts through his Achilles tendons and leaves him to bleed to death.  The remaining townspeople travel to Winyerp to perform in a competitive [[Eisteddfod]]. Once there, they discover that due to the numerous deaths they lack a full cast, and that Tilly has designed and sewn the costumes for Winyerp's performance. While the townspeople are away, Tilly sets fire to her house and to a bolt of red fabric soaked in kerosene that is rolled out down the hill towards the town. Tilly states that she is no longer cursed, and leaves the town by train. The townspeople return to find that the town has burned down.  
Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F'
  The remnants of Frieza's army, led by an alien named [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Sorbet|Sorbet]], head to Earth where they convince [[Pilaf (Dragon Ball)|Pilaf]], Mai, and Shu, who have collected the Dragon Balls, to summon the wish-granting dragon [[Shenlong (Dragon Ball)|Shenron]]. Sorbet makes a wish to revive Frieza, but Shenron can only bring him back to life in the form of the pieces that [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Future Trunks]] cut up, which Sorbet's minions reassemble using their advanced technology over the following two months. Once restored, Frieza plans revenge against the Super Saiyans, but upon learning that [[Goku]] has gotten stronger to the point of defeating [[Majin Boo|Majin Buu]], he postpones the invasion so he can train himself for the first time in his life.  [[Jaco the Galactic Patrolman]] travels to Earth to warn [[Bulma]] that Frieza is approaching, and she gathers five of the Z fighters. With Goku and [[Vegeta]] training with [[Whis]] on the planet that houses [[Beerus]], the God of Destruction, unaware that Frieza has been revived, [[Gohan (Dragon Ball)|Gohan]], [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], [[Kuririn|Krillin]], [[Kame-Sennin|Master Roshi]], [[Tenshinhan|Tien Shinhan]], and Jaco fight off Frieza's soldiers; however, the five Z warriors are unable to beat Frieza, even with Gohan as a Super Saiyan.  Bulma is finally able to reach Whis; Goku and Vegeta return to Earth to face Frieza. Whis and Beerus join them in order to eat a strawberry sundae Bulma has prepared for them, neither caring about the outcome of the battle. Despite powering up to Final Form, Frieza is unable to defeat Goku, but the latter deduces that he is holding back. The two then agree to fight at full power, with Goku transforming into a new form with a glowing-blue aura called サイヤ人ゴッド|Sūpā Saiya-jin Goddo Sūpā Saiya-jin}}, and Frieza evolving into his new gold-plated form . Although Frieza is finally able to gain the upper hand, Goku and Vegeta soon realize that Frieza's golden form drains his powers quickly, due to his lack of mastery.  Goku eventually turns the tables, beating down Frieza. He gives him the chance to leave, but is shot in the chest by Sorbet's ray gun when he lowers his guard. Frieza stands over the incapacitated Goku, and offers Vegeta a chance to kill Goku and to command his future army, but Vegeta refuses, transforming into his own Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form. When Krillin attempts to revive Goku with a Senzu bean, Frieza attacks him, but Vegeta deflects the shot, which kills Sorbet. Vegeta ends up battering Frieza, knocking him out of his golden form. Humiliated and angered, Frieza shoots a blast into the Earth, destroying it and Vegeta. Goku, Whis, Beerus, and the Z fighters are left on a small piece of rock in space, where they lament the loss of the planet; Goku regrets not killing Frieza when he had the chance. Whis remarks he can turn back time up to three minutes and, after doing so, Goku destroys Frieza with a ''Kamehameha'', much to Vegeta's anger.  In the aftermath, as the characters say their goodbyes to Beerus and Whis, Goku and Vegeta discuss the assertion by Whis that, if the two of them were to team up, opponents like Frieza would not have a chance to knock them out. Vegeta replies he would rather die than go through that again. Goku agrees and laughs as Vegeta smiles and remarks that it is about time they finally agree on something.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Frieza returns to Hell, and to his dismay, is welcomed back.

The DUFF
 Bianca is enjoying her senior year of high school in the [[suburbs]] of [[Atlanta]] with her two best friends, Jess and Casey, both of whom are significantly more popular than she is. She is also the neighbor and former childhood friend of Wesley, a star on the school's football team, with whom she had fallen out during high school. She has a crush on guitar-playing Toby, and reluctantly attends a party hosted by mean-girl Madison, hoping to talk to him. The party turns out to be a disaster for her, as it's there that Wesley unthinkingly reveals to her that she is the DUFF of her friend group, the Designated Ugly Fat Friend. The DUFF does not actually have to be ugly or fat, he explains, it's just the person in a social group who is less popular and more accessible than the others in the group. People exploit the DUFF to get to the popular people.  Bianca is insulted and devastated, but she soon realizes Wesley is right. The students in her high school are only interested in her as a way to get to Jess and Casey. She takes her anger out on Jess and Casey and "unfriends" them on social media and in person.  Bianca later overhears Wesley's science teacher Mr. Fillmore telling Wesley that unless he passes the midterm, he's off the football team, which could cost him his football scholarship. Desperate to change her social standing and go on a date with Toby, Bianca strikes a deal with Wesley—she'll help him pass science if he'll advise her how to stop being a DUFF. They have a fun time at a mall, attempting a makeover by buying new clothes. This backfires when Madison's minion records Bianca playing around in her new clothes and pretending that a mannequin is Toby. They create a video ridiculing Bianca and post it online leading to the entire school mocking her. It also becomes clear that Madison (a reality-TV wannabe) feels possessive of Wesley, her on-again off-again boyfriend, and is jealous of Bianca's relationship with him.  Wesley tells Bianca not to let the video destroy her. Instead, he suggests she own it and just be upfront with Toby by talking directly to him and asking him out. When Bianca sees Toby at school, she does ask him, and to her surprise he accepts. When Wesley becomes frustrated by the constant arguing between his parents, Bianca takes him to her favorite spot in the forest, her "think rock," to help him cope with a possible divorce. They kiss, but joke about it and pretend it didn't mean anything. At Bianca and Toby's date at his house, she finds herself thinking about Wesley, but tries to brush it off. She ultimately discovers that Toby is "Duffing" her—spending time with her in order to connect with Jess and Casey. She confronts Toby, finally seeing him for the shallow and superficial jerk he is, and leaves in tears. Seeking Wesley to talk with him about the date, she finds him at the thinking rock kissing Madison.  Angry with Toby and Wesley, she reunites with Jess and Casey who were genuine friends all along. They, along with her understanding mother Dottie, convince her to go to the homecoming dance with them, in an outfit they create together that incorporates elements of Bianca's previous wardrobe such as her flannel shirts. At the dance, Bianca tells off Madison, saying essentially that we are all DUFFs who should be true to our own identities and her bullying was just a reflection of her own insecurities about herself. Madison is crowned homecoming queen and Wesley is crowned king, but he rejects Madison and the title and kisses Bianca in front of the whole school. In the end, Bianca's article about homecoming is a hit with the students; Bianca is going to attend Northwestern University while Wesley goes to Ohio State. In the end Bianca and Wesley are still together.

Eighteam
 In the late 80's and early 90's, Chipolopolo were a very promising national football team and in the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympic Games]] in [[Seoul]] they surprised the world, and thrashed [[Italy national football team|Italy]] 4-0. Following this victory, they had their eyes on winning the [[Africa Cup of Nations]] trophy and qualifying for their first [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in 1994.  This was not meant to be. On the 27th of April 1993, a Zambian Air Force plane carrying the team, coaches and administrative staff, ditched into the Atlantic Ocean about 500 metres offshore from [[Libreville]], [[Gabon]]. All passengers and crew, including 18 players, died in the accident. Chipolopolo's captain, [[Kalusha Bwalya]] was not aboard the ill-fated flight as he was in the Netherlands playing for [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] at that time and had made separate arrangements to make his own way to [[Senegal]] to take part in the match. Two other players, [[Charly Musonda (footballer, born 1969)|Charles Musonda]] and [[Johnson Bwalya]] also were not aboard. The [[Football Association of Zambia]] then put all their efforts into building a new team. The new team qualified for the [[1994 Africa Cup of Nations]] and only lost to Nigeria in the final.

Eighteen years and 9 months later, [[Zambia national football team|Zambia]] won the [[2012 Africa Cup of Nations]] in [[Gabon]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]], with the finals taking place a short distance from the place of the 1993 crash. [[Zambia]] became African champions for the first time, beating the favourite [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] after a long penalty shoot-out.

Once an acclaimed, up-and-coming editor, Rey lost his right-hand fingers in a freak accident and is now handicapped by a prosthetic wooden hand. After hours, an unknown killer sneaks into the studio and kills lead actor Claudio Calvetti and his girlfriend Veronica while they view a workprint of the film. Actress Margarit Porfiry stumbles upon Vernoica's hanging body and is stricken with [[hysterical blindness]]. Her husband, Police Inspector Peter Porfiry, interviews studio employees.  Claudio's co-star Cal Konitz has his dreams of a larger role in the film are dashed when Mancini introduces Cesare, a lookalike stand-in to replace Claudio. Meanwhile, Police Chief O'Connor pressures Porfiry into closing the case, since Margarit is his daughter. Porfiry begins suspecting Rey, since the victims' fingers were crudely severed in much the same manner as Rey's. Porfiry interviews Mancini, and learns that Rey was once instituted in an asylum.  Back at the studio, Cesare is murdered in the shower and his fingers are severed. With Cesare dead, Francesco instructs Rey to re-cut the film to make Cal the new star. Porfiry questions Rey about his time in the asylum, and Rey recounts how his start in the business as an editor for acclaimed [[Art house film|art house]] director Umberto Fantori, Bella's father, whose debut film ''The Mirror and the Guillotine'' earned him critical acclaim and introduced him to his wife, star Josephine Jardin. When his wife was fired by Mancini on her next film, the pressures of editing Fantori's next project, the world's longest film, mounted and Rey accidentally cut off his own fingers in a fit of madness. What Rey doesn't tell him is that he's found what appears to be footage of the murders, taken by an unknown third party. The interview over, Rey returns to work in the editing suite with Bella, where she confesses her love for him, but Rey resists her because he is married. Porfiry, meanwhile, is introduced to Cal's girlfriend Jasmine, who reveals that the two were once lovers. Porfiry remains oblivious to the bladed instruments in Cal's car.  That night after another argument with his wife, Rey has a vision of a dark man with bright blue eyes stalking him from the shadows in his room. Porfiry, meanwhile, infiltrates the asylum where Rey was institutionalized, and meets the director Dr. Casini. Casini tells Porfiry that Rey attempted to kill his assistant Giuseppe, who is now a patient at the asylum himself, his head mysteriously wrapped in bandages. Casini explains to Porfiry [[Allegory of the Cave|Plato's Allegory of the Cave]]; of men who spend their entire lives believing shadows on the wall to be living, breathing beings.  Porfiry returns him to find that Margarit now has a seeing-eye [[German Shepherd]] named Rolfie. After the two make love, the killer breaks into their home and traps Porfiry outside of his room, separated from Margarit. Porfiry break the door down using an axe, but the killer throws Margarit in the way as a body shield, killing her. Porfiry stages the scene to exonerate himself, cutting off Margarit fingers and feeding them to Rolfie. Giancarlo arrives and holds Porfiry at gunpoint, but the Porfiry feeds him alcohol and confuses him into supporting Porfiry's narrative about the incident.  O'Connor berates Porfiry over Margarit's death, and the killer calls him at the station to taunt him. Porfiry convinces O'Connor into supporting a plan where Giancarlo goes undercover as the new editor on ''Tarantola''. Rey meanwhile, has been suffering from blackouts and hallucinations, and finding a bloodied shirt in his editing suite, begins to suspect himself as the killer. Mancini fires him and replaces him with Giancarlo, Rey dejectedly returns home to find Josephine obsessively watching Cal's demo tape. Burning the bloodied shirt in the kitchen sink, Rey begins having strange, otherworldly visions involving Bella; glimpsing a [[Lovecraftian horror|Lovecraftian]] netherworld filled with massive film reels and boiling tar. Bella meanwhile, finds the footage of the murders. Watching it, she is murdered by the killer; an act echoed in Rey's vision. He rushes to the studio, but arrives too late.  Trying to complete the film without any prior filmmaking knowledge, Giancarlo is beset by venomous tarantulas in the editing suite and is disembowled by the killer. Over-schedule and over-budget, Mancini rehires Rey to finish the film, Rey revealing that he'd already completed his assembly cut before being fired. Mancini is ecstatic and the film is saved. Porfiry, convinced Rey is the killer, confronts Father Clarke, who tries to tell him his conviction is misguided. He explains an old, Roman-era superstition that editors were believed to be bridges to the netherworld.  Cal, learning that Rey has cut him from the film completely, threatens to kill Rey with a chainsaw. Rey points out that Cal blinks incessantly whenever he tries acting, which lets Rey know that Cal's bluffing. Cal leaves in a huff, but vows to still have his revenge. He tells Porfiry that Rey is a madman, and Porfiry mentions his suspicion that Rey may have ties to the occult, telling Cal that the best way to get to Rey is through his wife. Rey returns home to a ransacked living room with only the television intact. Viewing Cal's demo reel, the [[Betamax]] tape suddenly comes to life and begins breathing. Cal kidnaps Rey and forces him to watch him rape Josephine despite Rey's pleas, but Josephine reveals that she's been having an affair with him and plans to leave Rey. That night, Jasmine and Cal are killed during sex by a [[chainsaw]].  While researching the occult at the library, Porfiry is beset by tarantulas. Porfiry brings his findings to Father Clarke, insisting that Rey is the killer. Clarke retorts the Rey is a righteous man, who volunteered to fix the masonry in the broken church bell tower years ago, allowing the bell to keep ringing. Porfiry stumbles across Porfiry's dead body, and enraged brakes into Rey's home and finds occult literature and a film reel filled with severed fingers. Taking this as confirmation of Rey's guilt, Porfiry sets out in search of Rey. Rey is struck by another vision, crawling out of his editing machine covered in tar with bright blue eyes, thus matching the appearance of the killer in his dreams. Porfiry chases Rey by car over a cliff. Rey flees on foot and makes his way to Mancini's mansion, but Porfiry catches up and holds him at gunpoint. Porfiry shoots Rey, but upon turning around is shocked to find Josephine performing an occult ritual; sacrificing Mancini and revealing herself as the true killer. Josephine proclaims herself an incarnation of [[Death (Tarot card)|Death]], Porfiry tries to shoot her but she causes his gun to backfire, blowing off the fingers on his right hand. Rey lights his wooden hand on fire and grabs Josephine, setting her ablaze and killing her. In the aftermath, Porfiry reveals that Cal confessed to killing Cesare for a better part in the film, and the two go their separate ways on good terms.  The next day, Porfiry returns to work at police station, but quickly becomes confused by strange incongruities surrounding him. Dr. Casini is the staff psychiatrist and Jasmine is his nurse, Josephine and Rey were never together, Giancarlo is alive and a full Inspector who solved the case, and Porfiry's injuries are now only minor. Confused, Porfiry rushes to the church to speak to Father Clarke, who tells him that belfry has remained damaged and the bell hasn't rung in over 100 years. Porfiry runs to the top of the tower, and digging through the damaged masonry finds a skull atop a stack of film reels. Examining the frames, he sees a reflection of himself repeating the same actions. Horrified, Porfiry screams realizing he's in another dimension, a camera pull-back revealing him to be in the studio editing machine.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Rey returns home to his wife; in this reality Bella.

Embrace of the Serpent
 The film tells two stories thirty years apart, both featuring Karamakate, an Amazonian [[shaman]] and last survivor of his tribe. He travels with two scientists, firstly with German Theo von Martius in 1909 and American named Evan in 1940, to look for the rare ''yakruna'', a (fictional) sacred plant.<ref></ref>  Theo, an ethnographer from [[Tübingen]] who has already resided in the Amazon for several years,  is very sick and is travelling by canoe with his field notes and a westernised local he saved from enslavement on a rubber plantation named Manduca. Karamakate prolongs his life, blasting white powder called "the sun's semen" (possibly a hallucinogenic made from [[virola]]<ref>p.423 Pratt, Christina ''An Encyclopedia of Shamanism Volume 2'' The Rosen Publishing Group, 1 June 2007</ref>) up his nose, but is reluctant to become involved with a westerner and refuses his money.  Theo is searching for yakruna as the only cure for his disease and the three set off in the canoe to search for it.  Many years later an American botanist, Evan (Brionne Davis), paddles up to a much older Karamakate (Antonio Bolívar) who has apparently forgotten the customs of his own people. Evan says he is hoping to complete Theo's quest  and Karamakate does assist, again reluctantly, saying his knowledge is spent. Evan has a book of Theo's final trek, which his aide sent back to Europe, as he did not survive the jungle. The book includes an image of Karamakate, which he refers to as his [[chullachaqui]], a native term for hollow spirit. Karamakate agrees to help him only when Evan describes himself as someone who has devoted himself to plants, although Evan's real purpose is actually to secure disease-free [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber tree]]s, since the United States's supplies of rubber from South East Asia had dwindled due to the Japanese wartime advance.  Both expeditions feature a Spanish Catholic Mission by the side of an Amazon tributary, run in 1909 by a sadistic, lone Spanish priest who beats orphan boys for any "pagan" behaviour, and in 1940 by a delusional [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] figure who believes he is the Messiah. He only trusts the visitors when he believes they are the [[Biblical Magi]], but Karamakate wins his respect when he heals his wife. By now the children of 1909 have grown into disturbed and violent acolytes.  In 1909, we are left with Theo, sick and having fled the Mission, arriving at a frontier post just about to be invaded by Colombian soldiers during the [[Amazon rubber boom]], where the sacred yakruna is being abused by drunken men, and cultivated, against local traditions. Karamakate is furious and destroys it. In 1940, Karamakate does show Evan the origin of the plant in striking denuded dome shaped mountains ([[Cerros de Mavecure]]), allegedly the home of yakruna. He reveals one yakruna flower that is on the last plant – he has destroyed all the others – and prepares it for Evan. The preparation being hallucinogenic, aids Evan in undergoing a superconscious experience. While most of the film is in black-and-white, a part of this experience is shown in colour to signify its intensity. The film ends with a transformed Evan remaining enamoured by a group of butterflies.  
En équilibre
 Marc Guermont is a horse trainer and stuntman in the Loire region of France. During a film production, an unrestrained dog scares his horse, which throws him and breaks his back, rendering him a wheelchair-bound paraplegic. Florence Kernel, an insurance loss adjuster, visits him at his rambling property and stables, where he lives alone, aided by Antoine. She tries to convince him to sign documents to obtain a €300,000 payout. He refuses, sensing his claim could be worth much more. He is correct: the loss adjusters receive a video of the accident and know he could win in a court case.  On a second visit, he scares and exhilarates her driving his specially adapted truck. The ethics of Florence's employer are called into question when her boss asks her to get his signature as soon as possible, using any approach. She returns, casually dressed, and tries to befriend Marc, offering him a CD of music he had playing on the last visit, and reveals she was once a pianist, but quit after failing a crucial exam. He convinced her to ride his horse - initially terrified, she soon loves the experience.  Home with her husband and two children, she begins to experience doubts about her life and relationship, and thinks fondly of Marc. Marc meanwhile tries to mount his horse using a knotted rope and upper body strength, but panics and is knocked unconscious and taken to hospital, and in a dream scene he is seen stunt-riding a white horse along a beach. He makes a recovery and mounts his horse again, with more success and an adapted saddle.  Eventually relieved of handling Marc's insurance case by her boss, Florence pities Marc, while developing feelings for him, and illegally passes him the business card of a friend, a top lawyer, who could help him. The lawyer puts Marc on course to receive a large insurance payout, but wants taped evidence of his conversations with the insurance company to strengthen her case. Marc invites Florence on a date unsuccessfully, also asking if she has taped their conversations. She eventually tries to pass him a voice-recording where she is heard to pressure him into accepting the inferior insurance deal. Marc refuses to accept it, knowing she will be fired if it is heard in court. Florence, plagued with guilt and attracted to Marc, wakes up before dusk and enters Marc's house, leaving the voice recorder. Drawn to Marc sleeping, she approaches him. He grabs her and they kiss and (off camera) have sex, unconstrained by his paralysis, and also spend the morning together in a speedboat and by a lake in the Loire region.  But they are not shown together after this - Florence eventually mails the recorder directly to the lawyer, who uses it to (off camera) help secure Marc's compensation claim in court. Florence is fired for her actions, rekindles her love of classical piano (including taking an exam), and takes a job in the local public library. She is in her house with her daughter when the TV shows Marc competing in a dressage event, confident on his horse, Othello. Florence cries openly. Marc is seen driving home from the competition with a horsebox. Cut to ending, leaving the question of their relationship unresolved.  
The Empire of Corpses
 In an alternate version of 18th Century [[England]] scientist [[Victor Frankenstein]] discovered a method of reanimating a corpse with a soul that could think, feel and speak. After his creation was destroyed another method was used to replace the missing [[Soul]] with an artificial soul known as "Necroware." It can be upgraded like a computer program, though the corpses are unable to speak, feel or think for themselves.   By the 19th century, the use of corpses becomes more common as Necroware is improved daily via a machine known as [[Charles Babbage]] in which Corpse Engineers have access to. John Watson, an aspiring corpse engineer, illegally creates his own Necroware and resurrects his deceased friend who he renames Friday. M, a member of British [[Secret service]], makes a deal with Watson after catching him: either he goes to prison or becomes an agent of the British Empire. Watson chooses the latter.  In India, Watson and Friday follow former U.S. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and his unnamed secretary. Watson and Friday are attacked by corpse assassins but are saved by [[Captain]] [[Frederick Gustavus Burnaby|Frederick Burnaby]], Watson's bodyguard. Watson is tasked by M to find [[The Brothers Karamazov|Alexei Fyodorovich Karamazov]], a Russian corpse engineer who stole The Memorandum, which also happened to be Frankenstein's original research on reanimating a corpse with a soul. Watson is ordered to retrieve the research. Watson and Burnaby meet with [[The Brothers Karamazov|Nikolai Krasotkin]] to act as their guide to [[Kabul]] where Karamazov is hiding.  They reach the [[Khyber Pass]] and are ambushed by upgraded corpses and rescued by Grant's secretary. Watson retrieves an advanced corpse who is able to speak its own name; Krasotkin suspects that Watson is planning to use the Memorandum to fully resurrect Friday. Watson is approached by the woman [[The Future Eve|Hadaly]] Lilith, Grant's secretary, wishing to know if the advanced corpses contained souls, but Watson is unsure.   They locate Karamazov who explains his wish to resurrect a human as Frankenstein once did. Karamazov upgrades Nikolai, whose soul is replaced by an artificial soul while Nikolai is still alive. This kills Nikolai but creates a more intelligent corpse capable of limited thought and speech. Watson is dismayed this was what Frankenstein's original creature was and angrily berates Karamazov for not trying to improve the technology. Karamazov admits the Memorandum is in Japan and asks Watson to destroy it. Karamazov then commits suicide by having Nikolai upgrade him. Watson, Friday and Burnaby depart to Japan, leaving Nikolai, Karamazov and his corpse servants to mindlessly follow their Necroware programming forever.  A year later in Tokyo, Watson meets Yamazawa Seigo of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], who knows the Memorandum is held by the [[You Only Live Twice (film)|Osato Chemical company]]. Watson, along with Friday, Burnaby, and Seigo infiltrate Osato Chemical, but are attacked by advanced corpses in armour. Watson flees to find the Memorandum and has Friday analyse it, setting off a trap that sets fire to the building. The analysis causes Friday to lash out and try to speak. A strange man retrieves the Memorandum, revealing himself as Frankenstein's original creation, known as The One - still alive after 100 years and just as intelligent as a human.  Watson awakes aboard the [[USS Richmond (1860)|USS Richmond]] heading for America. Burnaby is also on board and the feral Friday is in chains. Grant wants Watson to work for him to defeat The One, who hates humans for creating him, but Watson spends the voyage fixing Friday. Upon reaching San Francisco, The One uses the Memorandum to send out a signal that causes corpses to attack humans, including the corpse crew of the USS Richmond. During the escape, Hadaly reveals she is an artificial life form created by her "father" [[Thomas Edison]], and she can control corpses using sound waves and desires to one day have a soul of her own. She escapes with Watson, Friday, and Burnaby while Grant is killed by an exploding corpse. At Hadaly's safe house, Watson finishes fixing Friday, making him immune to the Memorandum's signal.  The One is captured by M, who plans to turn all humans into corpses; thus ending every war. The One is taken to the Tower of London where he has his mind analysed by Charles Babbage and the preserved brain of Victor Frankenstein. A new stronger signal is sent out by M causing even more corpses to attack humans. Aboard the submarine USS Nautilus, Watson, Hadaly, Friday and Burnaby smash through the [[Traitors' Gate]]. Burnaby fights the corpse guards with Hadaly's flamethrower while the others fight their way to M. Hadaly knocks out M and uses her sound waves to suppress The One's mind, while Friday takes over Charles Babbage to stop the signal. M awakens and shoots Hadaly before being shot by Watson. Now free, The One kills M, overpowers Hadaly, and takes over Friday.  The One finally reveals his true plan, to create the bride Victor Frankenstein promised him. Having orchestrated everything, he plans to combine all the corpses primitive minds into a true human mind. Then, using the Memorandum and Charles Babbage, he will create a human soul from the knowledge inside Victor Frankenstein's brain and insert both the true mind and the human soul into Hadaly while he transfers his own soul and mind into Friday's body. As The One is on the verge of success, Burnaby damages Charles Babbage. The One is returned to his own body and Friday restarts taking over Charles Babbage, sealing The One's soul inside the Memorandum. The One tries to drag Watson in with him. Inside the Memorandum, Watson struggles until a smiling Friday helps him and The One is defeated.  Watson awakes in time to escape the collapsing building with Hadaly and an unconscious Friday. Hadaly laments over having acquired and lost her soul, though Watson assures her he likes her just the way she is. She urges him not to give up trying to resurrect Friday.  Back in the house where he resurrected Friday, Watson is seen combining the research of Karamazov with the surviving pages of the Memorandum to perform an unknown corpse upgrade on himself.   4 years later in London, Watson is seen fleeing with his new companion, [[Sherlock Holmes]], whilst Burnaby and Hadaly, who now goes by the name [[Irene Adler]], watch from nearby. What appears to be a fully resurrected Friday also watches from a rooftop.

During a game of hide-and-seek, Emilie turns off the internet modem, removes the laces from the kids' shoes, and breaks open the safe in the parents' room. She later calls Jacob to the bathroom and asks him for a new tampon, as she's on her period. He asks what that is, and then retrieves one for her. She makes him unwrap it, then inserts it in front of him, flushing blood down the toilet. In the restaurant, the parents are being watched by Skinny Man. Dan, the father, tells Joyce, the mother, that he thinks he needs to have “the talk” with Jacob who is going through puberty. He implies that Jacob has been exploring adult content sites.

She texts Skinny Man that she's found her cub.   Jacob takes his dad’s gun, aiming it at Emelie. She tells him to shoot her but Jacob drops it. The doorbell rings and Emelie tells the kids not to say anything, slapping Jacob when he retorts. It is Maggie, the kids' usual babysitter, who is checking in since she hasn't heard from Anna, her friend. Sally shoves a note in Maggie's bag. Maggie reads the note about the imposter but Emelie knocks her unconscious. She forces the kids to drink sleeping syrup and tries to suffocate Jacob with a pillow after they have fallen asleep, but Jacob has forcefully vomited up the syrup. Maggie wakes and attacks Emelie to protect the children, but Emelie kills her. She plans to kidnap Christopher so he can become her new child but Jacob has hidden him. Emilie texts Skinny Man that she needs more time. When Dan and Joyce are on their way home, a car drives into them. Skinny Man has sacrificed himself for Emelie's dream of a new child, and is now dead. Police tell the parents that he had no ID.  Jacob subdues Emilie with exploding fireworks before taking away a sleeping Sally. Police open the trunk of the crashed car and find Anna’s corpse. Dan and Joyce learn this and start rushing home.

The End of the Tour
 Writer [[David Lipsky]] ([[Jesse Eisenberg]]) is dismayed to hear about the [[suicide]] of novelist [[David Foster Wallace]] ([[Jason Segel]]) in 2008. He had interviewed the author over a period of days twelve years earlier, following the publication of Wallace's novel ''[[Infinite Jest]]'', which received critical praise and became an international bestseller, a touchstone for numerous readers. He listens to the recordings he made during their time together.  The film returns to the period shortly after the book's release. Although initially skeptical of the high praise Wallace's book is receiving, Lipsky – a writer having only marginal success – is awestruck after reading it. He persuades his editor at ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine to give him an assignment to interview Wallace during his book tour.  The journalist travels to meet Wallace at his home on the outskirts of [[Bloomington-Normal, Illinois]] (near [[Illinois State University]] where the author teaches writing). Lipsky finds the young author unassuming and amiable, but indifferent to being interviewed. Wallace permits Lipsky to tape-record their conversations, with the proviso that Lipsky won't use any direct quotes which Wallace asks to have taken "off the record" five minutes later. Wallace opens up to Lipsky on a variety of subjects, ranging from dogs to television to fame and self-identity, but remains somewhat guarded. He tacitly admits to [[alcoholism]], but offers few details of his experience. Lipsky's mention of Wallace's brief voluntary institutionalization under a suicide watch causes some friction between them.  As their conversation continues late into the night, Wallace invites Lipsky to stay in his unused "guest room", rather than a motel. The room is dominated by stacks of his books. They resume the interview in the morning. Lipsky also accompanies Wallace for a few days to [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul]], where Wallace has the final appearance of his book tour. There they meet two women friends of Wallace: Betsy, whom he knew in graduate school, and Julie, a literary critic; the men spend time with the women later that night and the next day at the [[Mall of America]]. Although Wallace and Lipsky generally get along well, Wallace becomes angry when he sees Lipsky flirting with Betsy.  After their return to Wallace's home, tension increases when Lipsky asks the author about rumors of past [[heroin]] abuse. Wallace denies it, accusing Lipsky of looking for a stereotypical angle from which to write his article. As their time comes to an end, the two spend a morning together, mainly as new friends rather than as journalist and subject. Lipsky summons the nerve to give Wallace a copy of his own novel, and they agree to stay in touch.  The closing passage is set fourteen years later, when Lipsky is on his own book tour. He reads from his memoir, ''[[Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself]]'' (2010), based on their 1996 encounter. He recounts the road trip he had with Wallace, reflecting on ideas the two had discussed.

The police arrive and arrest Nenad's father and confiscate all of his illegally owned weapons, which were kept in a box under his bed. The police offer Nenad's father a chance at employment at the police station, but he turns it down. * Nenad's hostile friends trap him under a giant bell for refusing to play a game, and the leading boy (Baskim) pulls out a pistol and shoots the bell. This causes the bullet to ricochet and hit Baskim. * Baskim's family questions him about who shot him. Baskim responds, "A Serb." Baskim's family and their gang set the Serbian enclave on fire, trapping Nenad under the bell tower. The heat and smoke nearly suffocates Nenad. Baskim feels guilt for trapping Nenad and revisits the bell where Nenad is trapped. * Nenad's family decides they want a new life and end up moving to [[Belgrade]] after they free Nenad from under the bell.

Eight months later, ''Hyde'', the directorial debut by Vince, is in the middle of post-production and is over budget by $15 million. Needing more money, Vince asks Ari if they can get an additional $10 million to complete the movie. Reluctant, but wanting to please him, Ari flies to Texas to meet the co-financiers of the movie, Larsen McCredle and his son Travis, to get them to give the money. Hesitant, Larsen sends Travis with Ari back to Los Angeles to see a cut of the film at Vince's private screening.  Vince has second thoughts on the rough cut and cancels the screening out of fear no one will enjoy it. He later gives Ari and Travis a copy of the movie for their viewing. Ari and Travis enjoy the movie but Travis requests that Ari cut the scenes with Vince's brother, [[Johnny "Drama" Chase]], out of the movie or he will not give the film the extra money. With Ari giving him no answer, Travis puts the post-production on hold. Vince and [[Eric Murphy|Eric "E" Murphy]] visit Travis to come up with a solution, but this results in Travis saying he did not like Vince's performance either and wants the entire movie to be redone with a new lead and director. In addition, studio [[List of recurring Entourage characters#John Ellis|CEO John Ellis]] removes Ari from the production.  The boys soon realize the reason Travis is angry over the movie is because Vince is spending time with [[Emily Ratajkowski]], with whom Travis is infatuated. Learning of this, Ari interrupts Ellis in a boardroom meeting with Larsen and Travis with this information. Surprised, Larsen says he will stay behind the movie but mandates the condition that Ari is no longer working for the studio because, although he agreed his son was being juvenile, Ari had disrespected his son. During this time, the boys are in the hospital as E's ex-fiancée Sloan goes into labor. Sloan gives birth to a girl, Ryan Murphy, and the boys celebrate.  Ari arrives at the hospital and also announces that he resigned and invested his severance to complete the movie. ''Hyde'' becomes a box office hit, grossing over $450 million worldwide. At the [[Golden Globe Awards]], Drama ends up winning the award for Best Supporting Actor. Stunned, Drama goes to accept the award and is silent for a moment before yelling his trademark ''[[Viking Quest]]'' phrase, "VICTORY!!!"  In a mid-credits scene, Ari's former assistant Lloyd has his wedding and Ari gives him away. When the group gets together for a picture, Billy Walsh suggests that they should make a film (or [[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|TV show]]) about the lives of Vince and the gang.

Bess, upon hearing from Jonas and seeing that Nia was Stage 4, takes her to a room with Jonas and Max and brief Nia on a deceased Stage 3 SOS patient, Eva.

She is successful and leaves the DEN but doesn't find Silas at his apartment. Meanwhile, Silas finds out that Bess, Jonas and Gilead were betrayed by Max, and were given the cure. He goes to the DEN where they tell him Nia died and so he contemplates suicide on a roof top, but gets the cure instead.

Entertainment (2015 film)
 After touring an [[Aircraft boneyard]] in the California desert, the film's main subject ([[Gregg Turkington]]) performs a stand-up routine as the character of [[Neil Hamburger]] to an audience of prisoners following a [[clown]] act by "Eddie the Opener" ([[Tye Sheridan]]). The convicts react positively to his jokes. Once at his hotel, he leaves a voicemail for his daughter while a [[soap opera]] plays on television. The next morning, he hikes across rock formations before his show at a bar. The show goes somewhat poorly as few patrons laugh at all during the main character's routine which one man heckles. This causes the performer to express irritation (in character) with the audience and the heckler.  The performer's cousin John ([[John C. Reilly]]) approaches him after the show and awkwardly converses about the unenthusiastic audience while passively criticizing the raunchiness of his routine. The main character responds somewhat defensively to the criticisms and blames the poor reception of the routine on the heckler. At another hotel that night, the main character leaves a second voicemail for his daughter. The next day, The Comedian tours an [[oil field]]. Another show takes place that night at another bar. Eddie the Opener gets a relatively positive reaction from the crowd, but the main character receives very little positivity himself, expressing the same in-character frustrations with the audience. After being told by the manager of the establishment that he couldn't book a hotel room, He stays at the house of the manager's cousin. A female member of the family watches the main character sleep as an image of him in a hallway dressed entirely in white appears on-screen.   He tours a [[ghost town]] the next day, leaving a very despondent voicemail for his daughter as he voices how hard it is to reach her. He disinterestedly spends the rest of the day with Cousin John, who drunkenly attempts to encourage the main character that night. The Comedian goes to a bowling alley and a [[Skeet shooting|shooting park]] the following day before crashing a [[chromotherapy]] seminar that night and falling asleep during it. At his hotel, he runs into the woman who was giving the lecture ([[Lotte Verbeek]]). She puts him in a red-light therapy booth before setting up chairs for another seminar, and The Comedian watches the same soap opera again in his hotel room. Another show takes place the next day, but only Eddie is shown performing to a wildly energetic crowd. The main character, however, gets a call from an online filmmaker who wants The Comedian to star in a video of his. He shows up in the desert with the filmmakers the next day but soon wanders off, seemingly impatient and irritated.  Before a show, Eddie approaches The Comedian and briefly expresses his gratitude in working with the main character, who responds somewhat indifferently. The show goes disastrously as not a single patron of the bar laughs and The Comedian throws extremely vulgar insults to a woman ([[Amy Seimetz]]), who throws her drink at him. She waits until The Comedian is walking to his car before attacking him. Eddie tries to help the main character by taking him to his hotel room; but The Comedian eventually lashes out at him as well.   The next morning, The Comedian stops on the road to observe a wrecked car. He hits a dog on the road that night which causes him to have a minor neurotic episode. Later, in a public bathroom, a stranger named Tommy ([[Michael Cera]]) asks if The Comedian can keep him company while he waits for someone to help him, as he claims his car broke down. The Comedian responds very little, staring blankly. He gets extremely drunk in his hotel room and leaves another voicemail to his daughter in which he quietly sings [[Ave Maria]].  Later, The Comedian performs at a [[white trash]] party which he also stays the night at. Afterwards, The Comedian is in a public restroom where he slowly investigates the cries of a woman coming from the women's restroom. He finds a distressed pregnant women in labor who begs for his help, and the film cuts to a bloodied Comedian falling asleep against the wall of the bathroom as he holds the presumably stillborn infant. He wakes up the next morning to children smearing chocolate on the window of the car he was sleeping in.  That night, during his act, the Comedian picks up a trophy in the venue and pretends to fire it at the audience like a gun, eventually resorting to simply making fart noises with his mouth before walking off the stage. The manager of the venue tells The Comedian: "We're not paying for that", and leaves. He later leaves a fifth voicemail for his daughter in a public restroom.   At a celebrity ([[Tim Heidecker]])'s pool party the next day, The Comedian emerges from a cake before having a mental breakdown on stage and throwing himself into the pool. As he swims to the edge of the pool, images appear of himself dripping wet on-stage as well as images of himself in the same white outfit from before, exiting a jail cell and walking to the same hallway seen previously. He enters the set of the soap opera that he had been watching and the film cuts to The Comedian watching himself on-screen while he has a manic episode.

Everest (2015 film)
    In May 1996 several commercial expeditions at base camp of [[Mount Everest]] prepare for a climb to the summit. [[Rob Hall]], who popularized commercial Everest missions, leads [[Adventure Consultants]]; [[Scott Fischer]] is chief guide for Rob's rival, [[Mountain Madness]]. Rob's clients include [[Beck Weathers]], an experienced climber; Doug Hansen, a former mailman pursuing his dream; climbing veteran [[Yasuko Namba]], who hopes to complete her final [[Seven Summits]] ascent; and [[Outside (magazine)|''Outside'']] magazine journalist [[Jon Krakauer]]. Helen Wilton manages Rob's base camp.  A month earlier in [[New Zealand]], Rob says goodbye to his pregnant wife Jan and promises he will be home for the birth. At base camp Rob receives a fax from her, informing him that their baby, not yet born, is a girl. He wants to name her Sarah, but Jan disagrees.  Worried about climber crowding, Rob persuades Scott to cooperate to reduce delays. On the summit attempt, Rob's group departs Camp IV before dawn, planning to complete the ascent and turn around by 2 pm, the latest safe time for return before nightfall. The group is delayed over an hour after discovering guide ropes are not installed on upper reaches of the climb. Beck has eyesight problems and stops. Rob tells him to return if his condition does not improve in a half-hour. Scott hurries back down to camp to help another climber, but plans to re-ascend. Rob warns him about over-exertion.  Rob reaches the summit on time and is joined by other climbers including Yasuko, who jubilantly plants her Japanese flag in the snow. Descending, Rob encounters Doug struggling just above the [[Hillary Step]] and orders him to turn back. Doug insists on continuing, saying he won't get the chance again. Rob reluctantly agrees and they reach the summit two hours later, well past safe return time. At the summit Doug is exhausted and increasingly suffering from [[high-altitude pulmonary edema|altitude sickness]]. Also at the top is Scott, exhausted and increasingly ill from [[high-altitude pulmonary edema]].  As Rob helps Doug descend, a blizzard strikes the mountain and Doug's oxygen bottle runs out, causing him to suffer [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. No extra bottles are stored on the route where Rob asked and he radios Helen to send someone up with oxygen. Doug, left alone briefly by Rob, semi-consciously unclips himself from the guide rope and walks unsteadily along the narrow path. He silently topples to his death a moment later.  Scott's condition worsens. He tells fellow climbers to continue descending without him. He lies down and later dies. Returning climbers reach Beck, his vision still impaired, but they all become lost as the blizzard obliterates the trail. Three climbers go for help, leaving Beck and Yasuko behind.  Guide Andy 'Harold' Harris reaches Rob with spare oxygen, but it is frozen shut. They huddle in place in the storm. While Rob sleeps, Andy hallucinates, a danger the camp doctor warned of. He strips off his outer clothing and slides off the mountainside to his death. In the morning, Rob radios Helen that Doug and Andy are gone and that his hands and feet are frozen. Helen calls Jan, hoping Rob will respond to her voice. Jan tells Rob that he must start moving. Rob tells her he is cold but comfortable and asks her to name their baby Sarah. He dies soon after.  Returning climbers tell the camp that Beck and Yasuko are stranded. The weather, however, makes rescue impossible. Helen calls Beck's wife, Peach, and informs her of the situation. In the morning, Beck miraculously awakens, sees Yasuko's corpse and stumbles back to camp alone, severely frostbitten and in dire need of medical help. Peach calls the American Embassy and organizes a helicopter rescue. Nepal Army pilot Lt. Col. Madan Khatri Chhetri successfully flies a harrowing high altitude mission to evacuate Beck. Meanwhile, one of Scott's guides, Anatoli, finds his body and moves it off the trail.  Returning home, Helen has an emotional reunion with Jan, who later gives birth and names her daughter Sarah. Beck returns to his family, heavily bandaged. Closing titles reveal that he lost both hands and nose to severe frostbite and that Rob's body remains on Everest.

Ex Machina (film)
 Programmer Caleb Smith, who works for the dominant search engine company Blue Book, wins an office contest for a one-week visit to the luxurious, isolated home of the CEO, Nathan Bateman. The only other person there is Nathan's servant Kyoko, who, according to Nathan, does not speak English. Nathan has built a [[humanoid robot]] named Ava with [[artificial intelligence]]. Ava has already passed a simple [[Turing test]] and Nathan wants Caleb to judge whether Ava is genuinely capable of thought and consciousness, and whether he can relate to Ava despite knowing she is artificial.  Ava has a robotic body but a human-looking face, and is confined to her apartment. During their talks, Caleb grows close to her, and she expresses a romantic interest in him and a desire to experience the world outside. She can trigger power outages that temporarily shut down the surveillance system which Nathan uses to monitor their interactions, allowing them to speak privately. The power outages also trigger the building's security system, locking all the doors. During one outage, Ava tells Caleb that Nathan is a liar who cannot be trusted.  Caleb grows uncomfortable with Nathan's narcissism, excessive drinking, and crude behaviour towards Kyoko and Ava. He learns that Nathan intends to upgrade Ava, "killing" her current personality in the process. After Nathan drinks until he passes out, Caleb steals his security card to access his room and computer. After he alters some of Nathan's code, he discovers footage of Nathan interacting with previous android models in disturbing ways, and learns that Kyoko is also an android. Suspicious that he may also be an android, Caleb cuts his arm open to examine his flesh.  At their next meeting, Ava cuts the power. Caleb explains what Nathan is going to do and Ava begs him to help her. They form a plan: Caleb will get Nathan drunk again and reprogram the security system to open the doors in a power failure instead of locking them. When Ava cuts the power, she and Caleb will leave together.  Nathan reveals to Caleb that he observed Caleb and Ava's last secret conversation with a battery-powered camera. He says Ava has only pretended to like Caleb so he would help her escape. This, he says, was the real test all along, and by manipulating Caleb so successfully, Ava has demonstrated true intelligence. Ava cuts the power. Caleb reveals that he suspected Nathan was watching them, and modified the security system when Nathan was passed out the previous day. After seeing Ava leave her confinement, Nathan knocks Caleb unconscious and rushes to stop her.  With help from Kyoko, Ava stabs Nathan, but in the process Nathan disables Kyoko and damages Ava. Ava repairs herself with parts from earlier androids, using their artificial skin to take on the full appearance of a human woman. She leaves Caleb trapped inside the facility, ignoring his screams, and escapes to the outside world in the helicopter meant to take Caleb home.

These document its abuses toward its patients, demise, and eventual abandonment.  Years later, Patrick volunteers to help Father Conway renovate the site.  Conway, who is disappointed that Patrick has not applied for college, believes that God has a special plan for him.  After talking to local junk man Greer, Conway and Patrick leave for the weekend.  When Patrick's friends discover the site will be unsupervised for the weekend, they organize a huge party there over Patrick's objections.  As the party winds down, seven people remain: Patrick, his younger brother Rory, Brian, Brad, Amber, Drew, and Reign, a girl that Patrick has met at the party.  After they discuss the site's troubled history and its potential for supernatural phenomena, Amber convinces the others to attempt to levitate Rory.  Amber says it worked, but the others dismiss it as a prank by Rory, who they say is attention-starved.  Embarrassed that he peed his pants, Rory runs off.  When Patrick and Reign encounter Rory later, they become convinced that he is possessed, as he is speaking in tongues and viciously attacking anyone who approaches him.  After restraining him, Reign convinces Patrick to call Father Conway for help.  The others react angrily, as they have been ingesting a variety of illegal drugs.  As they argue, Greer returns and threatens to call the cops unless Amber has sex with him.  Greer hears a sound from upstairs and investigates, only to be killed by Rory.  Brian and Amber panic, and as they flee Exeter, they accidentally strike Father Conway with their car, apparently killing him.  The car does not make it off the grounds.  As the teens debate what to do next, Exeter's security system locks them in.  Having two dead bodies and a pile of drugs, the teens agree to resolve the situation themselves.  Using their cell phones, they find a do-it-yourself exorcism guide and perform it on Rory.  Although it initially seems to have succeeded, Rory reverts to his possessed self.  Looking for clues to help them, Reign and Patrick discover video tapes of a troubled teen at Exeter, Devon, who is apparently Conway's child.  A message written in blood on one of the ceilings demands that the teens speak to the entity, so they carve out a Ouija board.  The entity identifies itself as Devon and demands they save it from a box, where it is trapped.  Rory recovers from his possession and does not remember anything.  At the same time, Amber shows signs of possession.  She kills Drew before the others drive her off.  Brad, frustrated by the attacks, arms himself with a pickax and looks for Amber.  He is surprised when he sees Father Conway, trips, and accidentally impales himself.  Reign and Patrick go after Amber while Rory and Brian guard the downstairs area.  Rory leaves to urinate, and Amber attacks Brian.  After killing Amber, Patrick and Reign find Rory, who says that Conway trapped him in a box for his own protection. The group encounter Brian, who is now possessed; Patrick kills Brian after he attacks them.  Reign insists that Conway is responsible for the events and says that he has invoked the evil spirits.  Rory, too, is doubtful of Conway's motives.  Patrick says that Conway would never hurt anyone.  When they find the security system, they disable the lock down, and Patrick forces Rory to flee to safety.  After seeing Conway kill Reign, Patrick angrily confronts him.  When Conway denies having a son, Patrick sets him afire, killing him.  Reign suddenly rises and explains that she is Conway's daughter, Devon.  Conway abandoned Devon and her mother, and after Devon's mother committed suicide, Conway hid Devon at Exeter.  Feeling abandoned, Devon swore revenge on Conway and the people he cares about.  She engineered the whole situation so that Patrick would kill Conway.  After a fight, Patrick traps her in a box as Exeter burns.  Later, two cops investigate the ruined site, only to find the box empty.  
Extinction (2015 film)
 After a virus turns people into zombies, a small group of survivors seek refuge in a snow-covered town, believing the virus and all of its monstrous creations had died out. But they only discover the infected had adapted to the environment change, for worse.  The story starts out with survivors on two buses trying to make it to a safe zone. The first bus is attacked by the infected. The people in the second bus, including the main characters (Jack, Patrick, Emma and baby Lu) try to escape. While hiding, Emma is attacked by an infected and bitten.  9 years later, Jack and Patrick are living separately in houses next door, divided by a fence. Emma has died and Lu, now 9, is living with Jack, who she calls father. It is revealed that Patrick is her biological father. She was taken away by Jack because Patrick became an alcoholic and when Emma was attacked and killed, Patrick didn't save her. Now, Patrick and Jack do not talk to each other, and Lu is forbidden to leave the premises. However, she bonds with Patrick's dog between the fence.  A few days later, Patrick and his dog come across a half eaten fox. He follows the trail and sees an infected. He tries to get away but hits a fallen tree.

Experimenter (film)
 The film is based on the true story of famed social psychologist [[Stanley Milgram]], who in 1961 conducted a series of [[Milgram experiment|radical behavior experiments]] at [[Yale University]] that tested the willingness of ordinary humans to obey an authority figure while administering electric shocks to strangers. In the first half of the film, it is shown how the experiments are conducted, with nearly every test subject succumbing to the pressure of the circumstances and administering shocks to a stranger, despite the stranger begging him to stop. Between the experiments, it is shown how Milgram meets Alexandra (or Sasha), who will become his wife and mother of two children.  The second half of the film shows how Milgram struggles with the public outcry about the ethics of the experiments and how his career advances as he becomes a professor in New York City and continues to study social interactions and social pressure in more benign experimental settings, including the [[small-world experiment]], the [[Stanley Milgram#Lost letter_experiment|lost-letter experiment]], the street-corner (or gawking) experiment, the [[familiar stranger]] experiment, and various experiments that he makes his students carry out. Archive footage occurs frequently, either as recordings that Milgram watches or as a backdrop for entire scenes. Milgram's work continues until he dies from a heart attack at the age of 51. In the final scene, the street-corner experiment is repeated in the present day, with a cameo of the real-life Sasha Milgram. In a mid-credits scene, more archival footage is shown.  
Eye in the Sky (2015 film)
 The film opens in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], where Alia Mo'Allim, a young girl, twirls a [[hula hoop]] made by her father in their backyard.  [[British Army]] Colonel Katherine Powell wakes up early in the morning and hears that an undercover British/Kenyan agent has been murdered by the [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] group. From [[Northwood Headquarters]] she takes command of a mission to capture three of the ten highest-level Al-Shabaab leaders, who are meeting in a safehouse in Nairobi. These include a British couple, Susan Helen Danford (based on [[Samantha Lewthwaite]]<ref></ref>) and her husband.  A multinational team works on the capture mission, linked together by video and voice systems. [[Aerial surveillance]] is provided by a [[USAF]] [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|MQ-9 Reaper]] [[unmanned combat aerial vehicle|drone]] controlled from [[Creech Air Force Base]] in [[Nevada]] by USAF pilot, 2d Lt Steve Watts. Undercover Kenyan field agents, including Jama Farah, use short-range [[ornithopter]] and [[insectothopter]] cameras to link in ground intelligence. [[Kenya Defence Forces|Kenyan]] [[special forces]] are positioned nearby to make the arrest. Facial recognition to identify human targets is done at [[Joint Intelligence Center Pacific]] at [[Pearl Harbor]] in [[Hawaii]]. The mission is supervised in the United Kingdom by a [[Cabinet Office Briefing Room|COBRA]] meeting that includes British Lieutenant General Frank Benson, two full government ministers and a ministerial under-secretary.  Farah discovers that the three high-level targets are now arming two [[suicide attack|suicide bombers]] (one is American) for what is presumed to be an attack on a civilian target. Powell decides that the imminent bombing changes the mission objective from "capture" to "kill". She informs drone pilot Watts to prepare a precision [[AGM-114 Hellfire|Hellfire missile]] attack on the building, and solicits the opinion of her British Army legal counsel. To her frustration, her counsel advises her to seek approval from superiors. Benson asks permission from the COBRA members. Citing conflicting legal and political views and contrasting the tactical value of the assassination with the negative publicity of killing civilians and the status of some of the targets as American or British nationals, they fail to reach a decision and refer the question up to the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|UK Foreign Secretary]], presently on a trade mission to [[Singapore]]. He does not offer a definite answer and defers to the [[US Secretary of State]], presently on a cultural exchange in [[Beijing]], who immediately declares the American suicide bomber an enemy of the state. The Foreign Secretary then insists that COBRA take [[due diligence]] to minimise [[collateral damage]].  Alia, who lives next door, is now near the target building selling her mother's bread.  The senior military personnel argue the risk of letting three high-level terrorist leaders, and two real-time suicide bombers, leave the house. The lawyers and politicians involved in the chain of command argue the personal, political and legal merits of and justification for launching a Hellfire missile attack in a friendly country not at war with the US or UK, with the significant risk of collateral damage. Watts and his enlisted sensor operator, A1C Carrie Gershon, can see the more direct risk of little Alia selling bread outside the targeted building, and they seek to delay firing the missile until she moves.  Farah is directed to try and buy all of Alia's bread so she will leave, but after paying her his cover is blown and he is forced to flee. Alia retrieves the bread he dropped and sits down to sell it a second time.  Seeking authorisation to execute the strike, Powell orders her risk-assessment officer to find parameters that will let him quote a lower 45% risk of civilian deaths. He re-evaluates the strike point and assesses the probability of Alia's death at 45–65%. She makes him confirm only the lower figure, and then reports this up the chain of command. The strike is authorised, and Watts fires a missile. The building is destroyed, with Alia injured but unconscious. However, Danford also survived. Watts is ordered to fire a second missile, which strikes the site just as Alia's parents reach her. Her parents suffer some injuries and rush Alia to a hospital, where she dies.  In the London situation room, the under-secretary tearfully berates Benson for killing from the safety of his chair. Benson counters that she watched while having coffee and biscuits, whereas he has been on the ground at five suicide bombings and adds: "Never tell a soldier that he does not know the cost of war."

 In 2005, undercover CIA operative Leonard Turner ([[Bruce Willis]]) is held captive and interrogated by a group of unidentified Russian arms dealers. His interrogators have been aware of Leonard's true identity and demand a full written list of individuals and businesses affiliated with the CIA in exchange for the safety of his wife and son. Leonard breaks from captivity and kills his interrogators, phoning his colleague Ken Robertson ([[D.B. Sweeney]]) to get his family to safety. Leonard's wife, Kate, was fatally shot by the interrogator's affiliates, while his teenage son, Harry (Nathan Varnson) hesitates on shooting the home invaders before being rescued by Robertson.  In 2015, an adult Harry ([[Kellan Lutz]]) joins the CIA's Prague branch under Robertson's wing much to Leonard's disapproval. While working as an analyst, Harry undergoes numerous field agent training sessions only to be rejected repeatedly by Leonard behind the scenes.  Meanwhile, Leonard is given an undercover assignment to recover an item called The Condor, a mobile computer capable of hacking the entire global [[telecommunications]] infrastructure that can only be deactivated with a physical key. While Leonard attempts to recover the device in Newark, New Jersey, he is ambushed and captured by arms dealer Drake Chivu (Joshua Mickel).  C.I.A. Station Chief Theodore Sitterson ([[Steve Coulter]]) is brought up to speed on the recent development and assigns field agent Victoria Phair ([[Gina Carano]]) to recover The Condor while keeping Harry out of the investigation. Incensed, Harry breaks free from his security escort led by Higgins ([[Dan Bilzerian]]) and flies to Newark in order to investigate Drake's associates.  Harry's first visit is to a biker bar known for its business association with Drake.  After instigating a fight and interrogating the patrons, Harry learns that Drake's brother is the lead mechanic at a local garage. Harry also encounters Phair, having previously parted from a romantic relationship on bad terms during their training. Harry only agrees to return after helping her recover the Condor and after rescuing Leonard. After interrogating Drake's brother, Harry and Phair learn that Drake is holding a party in a local nightclub. Enlisting Phair's roommate, Kris (Lydia Hull), Harry and Phair enter the nightclub. Meanwhile, Sitterson reviews Leonard's video-recorded ransom and prepares an assassin for deployment in suspicion of Harry having committed [[treason]], much to Robertson's dismay. The assassin ambushes Harry in the nightclub's restroom while Drake captures Phair.  Maintaining contact with their communications earpiece, Phair gives clues to Harry while he and Kris try to locate Drake's car. The final destination leads them to an abandoned factory, where Harry is tranquilized by Drake himself before being reunited with Leonard.  Harry regains consciousness and is reunited with his father, only to find himself questioned on the people aware of Harry's whereabouts. Harry only confides that he told Robertson about his last known location, with Leonard's approval. At this point, Leonard reveals to his son that he went rogue and allied himself with Drake in order to draw out the people interested in recovering the Condor, as well as the perpetrators and CIA mole responsible for Kate's death. During the business deal, Leonard demonstrates the Condor's capabilities by sabotaging China's electronics infrastructure before double-crossing the Russian customers. The Russian customers have been revealed to be responsible for purchasing Leonard's personal information and ordering Kate's death, while Leonard has Harry fatally shoot the Russian ringleader.    After seemingly tying up the loose end, Robertson and Higgins intercept the Turners, with Robertson revealing himself as the mole responsible for Leonard's blown cover, and also responsible for the recent assassination attempt on Harry. Robertson shoots Leonard in the stomach. Phair breaks free from captivity and shoots at Drake's henchmen while Higgins engages Drake in hand-to-hand combat. Harry engages in a car chase with Robertson and fatally wounds him with a vehicle collision. Shortly after recovering the Condor, Harry destroys the device with an assault rifle to prevent it from falling to enemy hands and mourns his father's death before leaving the scene with Higgins, Phair, and Kris.  During the aftermath, Harry gives Phair a phone call to rekindle their romance before killing Drake with a [[car bomb]].

The Exorcism of Molly Hartley
  After causing a botched [[exorcism]] that resulted in the death of a fellow priest and a pregnant woman, Father John Barrow ([[Devon Sawa]]) is committed to a Catholic mental asylum. Chaplain Henry Davies ([[Peter MacNeill]]) informs him that the Vatican has revoked his status as a priest. Meanwhile, Molly Hartley ([[Sarah Lind]]), the morning after celebrating both her twenty-fourth birthday and becoming the youngest partner in her firm, is arrested after police inspecting her home after a noise complaint finds the corpses of the two friends she engaged in a threesome with the night before. While interrogating Molly, she hears strange noises before she begins to have a deeper voice and refers to herself as "we". She is sent to the same mental asylum for psychiatric evaluation under Dr. Laurie Hawthorn ([[Gina Holden]]), but her condition worsens after an insect-like creature enters her body.  Hawthorn looks through Molly's past records and diagnoses Molly's symptoms as her subconscious fulfilling a claim she told her high school guidance counselor that she was claimed by the devil on her eighteenth birthday (which explains the sudden change from an average student to becoming academically successful) and describes it as an incubation or pregnancy for six years, six months, and six days. However, after supernatural occurrences happen around Molly, who is forcibly bound to her bed in solitary, Dr. Hawthorn begins to believe in demonic possession. With limited options, she asks Barrow to perform the exorcism in exchange for signing his release forms. Though he initially refuses, after the suicide of an asylum employee, supernatural occurrences, and seeing Molly for himself, he visits Davies, who encourages him to help Molly, handing him his clerical attire and the items he needs to perform the exorcism. On the last day of incubation, before going to Molly's room, Barrow sees several people clad in black standing outside. Barrow manages to perform the exorcism, trapping several insects that come out of Molly's mouth in a special box, which he keeps in a container filled with holy water. Molly recuperates in a shared room, thanking Barrow for saving her. Dr. Hawthorn signs his release papers, but as Father Barrow walks out the asylum, patients and orderlies stare at him.  Barrow returns the container to Davies, who places it in his basement for safekeeping. Barrow notices Davies' book on Satanism and how the letters on the cover match the letters on Molly's forehead during the exorcism. Davies explains this is "Leviathan", the fourth book of the Satanic Bible that explains the Antichrist will be born after the worst sin committed, Matricide, is committed on the "mother of the devil" or the person whose body was used to incubate the devil. Barrow demands to see the box, but upon opening the container, he finds that the box has been replaced with a large stone. Davies hits Barrow, knocking him out. Meanwhile, Molly wakes up and discovers the other patients in her room have possessed-like eyes. She is dragged by an orderly and is taken to an underground room.  Barrow wakes up in a locked room in the asylum where he witnesses a patient commit suicide in the room next to him filled with other dead patients. An orderly comes brandishing a gun and orders him to come with him. Dr. Hawthorn is in her office when another orderly orders her to follow him, though unknown to him she takes a pair of scissors with her. He takes her to a room filled with dead employees, but before he can kill her, she fatally stabs him with her scissors. She witnesses Father Barrow being led by the orderly and runs away. Barrow and the orderly arrive at the underground room, where Davies and the people in black Barrow saw earlier take part in a ritual to sacrifice Molly to bring forth the Antichrist and Barrow, the father of the devil since he was the one who extracted the devil through an unholy ritual. Before he can kill Molly, Dr. Hawthorn stabs Davies through the abdomen, dropping the box and releasing the insects, providing a distraction as Molly stabs Davies. Barrow, Dr. Hawthorn, and Molly escape while several of the participants are killed by the insects, but the orderly and several of the participants chase after them with weapons. They fall and the orderly nearly shoots them, but the police arrive and shoot the orderly and arrest those present. The police enter the underground room, where a few surviving insects escape through a tunnel.  The police, having suspected Davies for a while, have been watching him. They find the list of people in his cult in his home, and Barrow assures Molly she is safe as she is driven away in an ambulance. Meanwhile, one of the insects flies into a moving school bus, where it approaches an outcast girl at the back of the bus. It inches toward her ear as the screen goes black.

Fantastic Four (2015 film)
  Childhood friends [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]] have worked together on a prototype teleporter since youth, eventually attracting the attention of Professor [[Franklin Storm]], director of the Baxter Foundation, a government-sponsored research institute for young prodigies. Reed is recruited to join them and aid Storm's children, scientist [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]] and technician [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], into completing a "Quantum Gate" designed by Storm's protégé [[Doctor Doom|Victor von Doom]].  The experiment is successful, and the facility's supervisor, Dr. Allen, plans to send a group from NASA to venture into a parallel dimension known as "Planet Zero". Disappointed at being denied the chance to join the expedition, Reed, Johnny, and Victor along with Ben use the Quantum Gate to embark on an unsanctioned voyage to Planet Zero, which they learn is a world filled with otherworldly substances. Victor attempts to touch the green-lava like substance, causing the ground they are standing on to erupt. Reed, Johnny, and Ben return to their shuttle just as Sue brings them back to Earth and Victor is seemingly killed after he falls into the collapsing landscape. The Quantum Gate explodes, altering Reed, Sue, Johnny, and Ben on a genetic level and granting them superhuman abilities beyond their control: Reed can stretch like [[rubber]], Susan can become invisible and generate [[force field (fiction)|force field]]s, Johnny can engulf his entire body in [[fire]] and fly, and Ben develops a rock-like hide which gives him [[superhuman strength]] and durability. They are then placed in government custody in order to be studied and have their abilities tested. Blaming himself for the accident, Reed escapes from the facility and tries to find a cure for their changes.  One year later, Reed is now a fugitive and has built a suit that helps him control his ability. Hiding in [[Central America]], he is eventually found by the United States military with Sue's help and captured by Ben, who has become a military asset along with Johnny and Sue. Johnny and Sue have been outfitted with specialized suits designed to help them control their abilities. Reed is brought to Area 57, where Dr. Allen conscripts him into rebuilding the Quantum Gate in exchange for giving Reed the resources to find a cure. Arriving in Planet Zero, Dr. Allen's explorers find Victor, who has been fused to his spacesuit and now possesses [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] abilities, and bring him back to Earth. Believing the human race needs to be destroyed so he can rebuild Earth in his image, Victor kills the scientists and soldiers in the base, including Dr. Allen and Professor Storm, and returns to Planet Zero using the Quantum Gate, with Ben, Johnny, Reed, and Sue in pursuit.  Now dubbing himself "Doom", Victor activates a portal on Planet Zero using the Quantum Gate and begins consuming the landscape of the Earth using a structure he created from the rock formations in Planet Zero. He is confronted by the four and, after a short battle, Ben punches Doom into the portal's energy beam, disintegrating him while Johnny closes the portal. Returning to Earth, the group is rewarded by the US military for their heroics by being given a new base of operations known as "Central City" in order to study their abilities without government interference. They decide to use their powers to help people and adopt the mantle of the "Fantastic Four".  
Far from the Madding Crowd (2015 film)
 In 1870 [[Victorian era|Victorian England]], Bathsheba Everdene ([[Carey Mulligan]]) is working on her aunt's farm in [[Dorset]]. Gabriel Oak ([[Matthias Schoenaerts]]), a new neighbour, sees Bathsheba riding her horse and falls in love with her. He proposes, but the headstrong Bathsheba declines, saying she is too independent and he would grow to despise her. One night a new sheepdog chases Gabriel's entire flock off a cliff. He settles his debts and is left penniless. He leaves in search of work. In contrast, Bathsheba inherits a farm from her uncle and leaves to take charge of it.  While Gabriel is at a fair trying to find employment, local soldiers attempt to recruit him and other townsmen. A young girl, Fanny Robin, notices him and points out one of the soldiers, Sergeant Frank Troy, her sweetheart. She suggests Gabriel seek employment at a farm in Weatherbury. Gabriel arrives to find several buildings on fire and saves the barn from destruction. At dawn the next day he is introduced to the farm's new mistress: Bathsheba. She hires him as a shepherd. In the meantime, Fanny goes to the wrong church for her wedding and Troy, apparently jilted, is devastated.  In town, Bathsheba proves to be a shrewd trader when selling her seed. She immediately is drawn to her neighbour William Boldwood ([[Michael Sheen]]), a prosperous and mature bachelor. Bathsheba sends Boldwood a [[Valentine's Day|Valentine]] as a joke, and he, both offended and intrigued, soon proposes marriage. Bathsheba says she does share his feelings but delays giving him a final answer. Gabriel admonishes Bathsheba for being foolish and unkind by playing with Boldwood's affections. She is stung by his criticism, and fires him, but the next day, given a crisis with the sheep that only he can manage, she sends after him and then pursues him to ask him to return. After her personal appeal, he comes back, saves some of the sheep, and stays on the farm.  One night while walking around her land, Bathsheba meets Frank Troy, who is mesmerized by her beauty. Uncomfortable, she tells him he should not be there, but the next day he returns to help with the harvest. Bathsheba learns he is of a noble family, but tells him to leave. He flirts with her and flatters her, and arranges a secret meeting. At their rendezvous in the woods, he shows off his swordplay, telling her not to flinch as he swings his sword around her head and body. He finally embraces her in a passionate kiss and Bathsheba is left in a daze. Gabriel warns her that Frank is dangerous and dishonourable, but she nevertheless elopes with him, and they share their wedding night together.  Returning to the farm, the newly married couple celebrate with all the workers. Gabriel warns of an approaching storm, but the belligerent and drunk Frank interrupts him and insists that the party will not allow it to rain. Gabriel attempts by himself to cover the harvest with tarpaulins and Bathsheba, ashamed of Frank's drunken behavior with the other men, comes out into the wind and rain to help. Chastened, she tells Gabriel that she was a fool to fall prey to Frank's flattery.  One day in town, Frank sees Fanny begging. She tells him she had gone to the wrong church, and that she is pregnant with his baby. He promises her he will find a home for them, and that she should stay in the [[workhouse]] in the meantime. Frank, a degenerate gambler, asks Bathsheba for £20 and she refuses, saying the money is for farm expenses.  Fanny and her baby die in childbirth; their coffin is delivered to Bathsheba's farm, which was her last known address. Bathsheba recognizes the name as one of her uncle's loyal servants and says the coffin should be brought inside for mourning. The words "Fanny Robin and child" are written on the coffin, but Gabriel surreptitiously erases "and child" from the slate while bringing it in. Bathsheba reads the erasure, opens the coffin, and discovers the mother and baby within. Frank, upon seeing Fanny and his dead baby, bends over the coffin and kisses Fanny's lips. Bathsheba protests that she is still his wife, but he coldly responds that even in death Fanny means more to him than Bathsheba ever had meant or ever could mean. In grief Frank goes to the beach, where he strips off his uniform and swims far into the ocean. The next day the constable arrives to inform Bathsheba that Frank has apparently drowned.  Left with Frank's gambling debts, Bathsheba worries she may lose the farm. Boldwood offers to buy it and merge it with his property, offering Gabriel a position as bailiff, and again proposes marriage. Bathsheba agrees to consider his offer. On the eve of the Christmas party he plans to throw, Boldwood shares with Gabriel that he knows of the affection he feels for Bathsheba, but adds he appreciates that he has been such a gentleman in the entire matter, and shows Gabriel the engagement ring he plans to offer her.  At the party, Boldwood graciously invites Gabriel and Bathsheba to share at least one dance. As they dance, she again asks Gabriel what she should do, and he answers simply to "Do what is right". She breaks off the dance and leaves, only to discover Frank, alive and well, lumbering up the pathway, outside. He was rescued from drowning but has faked his death for some weeks, preferring the idea of being 'dead.'  Regretting his decision, he has returned and demands money from Bathsheba, claiming it was unfair that he gave up his profession for her and now lives off nothing while she has money and a house.  When she insists she has no money, Frank demands that she sell the farm and grabs her roughly, screaming that she is still his wife and must obey him.  Enraged, Boldwood emerges from the house and kills Frank with a single blast from his rifle, for which he is promptly imprisoned. As Gabriel witnesses all the finery, many dresses and jewellery, that Boldwood had already laid out upstairs in anticipation of Bathsheba's 'yes' answer,  Bathsheba is remorseful and guiltridden. Gabriel tells her that if it's any consolation Boldwood is bound to be spared his life, for acting in a 'crime of passion'.  Some time later, Gabriel announces that since the farm is now secure, he'll be emigrating to America in four days time. As he leaves on foot early in the morning, Bathsheba stays at the farm battling her feelings and stubbornness. Finally, she chases after him on horseback and begs him not to leave, thanking him for all he's done for her, and always believing in her. Gabriel tells her, if only she would accept his love, then asks her if she would agree were he to propose again. Bathsheba smiles and tells him he needs ask once more. Gabriel kisses her passionately in response, and they walk back hand in hand.  
The Family Fang (film)
 The film opens on Baxter and Annie Fang (Jack McCarthy and [[Mackenzie Smith]]) holding hands in the back of their parents car as their father Caleb ([[Jason Butler Harner]]) dons a security guard uniform. The family enters a bank and Baxter uses a gun to rob a teller of all her lollipops. Baxter shoots his gun when Caleb rushes him, while posing as a security guard. Their mother Camille ([[Kathryn Hahn]]) pretends to be shot, and Annie grieves over her prone body. When the family gets up and leaves, Caleb gives a speech to the bank patrons about cherishing life and takes a bow.  The adult Annie ([[Nicole Kidman]]) is a successful actress on a film set where the director has surprised her by asking her to go topless in a scene. After initially refusing, she returns to the set without her top. A crew member snaps her photo and sells it to a tabloid. The adult Baxter ([[Jason Bateman]]) sees the photos in a convenience store. He is out of sorts after having published two novels, and he accepts a job writing about [[potato gun]]s. Baxter gets drunk with his subjects and allows them to perform the [[Shooting an apple off one's child's head|William Tell]] trick on him, which results in him getting shot in the ear and hospitalized. The Fangs reunite due to Baxter's injury.  Caleb enlists Annie and Baxter, whom he calls "A and B", into a new piece of [[performance art]]. Annie hands out fake coupons for free chicken sandwiches at an open air [[food court]]. Caleb tasks Baxter with filming the chaos that will ensue when the cashier declines to honor them and customers get mad. To his dismay, the cashier gives free sandwiches to everyone who asks for one. Caleb becomes irate, while Annie and Baxter feel that their parents have lost whatever artistic merit they used to have.  During their reunion, Annie watches old tapes of the family's performance art, as well as a documentary about her parents shot by Hobart Waxman ([[Harris Yulin]]). The film captures Caleb's sophomoric and didactic performance pieces, like shooting Hobart with a crossbow. Annie also recalls another piece that featured her and Baxter performing [[outsider music]] in [[Central Park]] with songs like "KAP (Kill All Parents)". Camille and Caleb heckle the kids, which horrifies the small crowd of onlookers. Later, the family laughs about the piece.  After a short while, Caleb and Camille disappear. Their car is found with blood on the dashboard. Annie tells the cops that the blood is fake and the disappearance is just another of Caleb's pieces. Baxter does not think it matters either way and is simply convinced that they have probably seen the last of their parents. Annie becomes obsessed with solving their disappearance.  Annie recalls a performance of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' in her senior year of [[high school]] where Romeo could not make the performance. Baxter was tasked with standing in for him, but he balked at having to kiss his sister onstage. He reluctantly agrees to do it, but when the audience laughs at his attempts to avoid kissing Annie, she is humiliated. Baxter finally gives Annie a fully romantic kiss onstage to the horror of the principal. He fires the drama teacher, Miss Delano ([[Linda Emond]]), who reveals to Annie and Baxter that losing her job was worth it to be a part of one of Caleb and Camille's more elaborate pieces. Annie and Baxter are horrified to realize that they were unwittingly made to kiss, and that was the beginning of the end of their performances with their parents. Later, in the documentary, Caleb confesses that until he realized he could use his children as living art, he was uninterested in being a father.  When the siblings are having a yard sale, they put on one of their parents CDs by a band called the Vengeful Virgins. They are stunned to hear a cover of "KAP", which was known only to the Fangs. They track down the teenage twin brothers in the band, and Annie interrogates them about the song while Baxter searches their house. He finds a videotape of Caleb cutting open his arm and smearing blood on the dashboard of his car. A short time later, Miss Delano comes home and reveals she is the boys' mother. Caleb enters the house behind her, and he reluctantly agrees to take Annie and Baxter to see their mother.  Caleb and Camille reveal that they have been planning this final piece for years. Caleb has spent time living together with Miss Delano as husband and wife, and accidentally fathered the twin boys. Camille has been spending time in a remote small town, posing as a widow for several months of each year. They had each established separate identities and believed that this final piece would be a fitting end to their career. They beg Annie and Baxter to help them keep their secret. The siblings are bitter over the betrayal but agree to hide the truth. The film shows Annie and Baxter seemingly happier and more well-balanced after letting go of their parents.

Decades later, five amateur paranormal investigators - Jake, Andre, Zoe, Judy, and Simon - are struggling to get their own television series. They learn that a producer is interested in their show, but demands they film a pilot episode at Farhope Tower, which is infamous due to the high number of suicides and murders committed there. While Jake, Judy, and Simon are enthusiastic about the opportunity, Andre is worried, as Farhope Tower was the first place he and Jake encountered the paranormal as children, and they had sworn never to go back. Jake convinces Andre that everything will be fine. That night, Jake has a nightmare in which he is wandering Farhope Tower before an unseen person grabs him by the neck.  The group go to the tower and find it abandoned and in disrepair. Simon finds a room with the message "Go Up" written all over the walls, then later finds several newspaper clippings regarding the incidents in the tower, including the murder from the opening scene, which also reveals that the pregnant woman's baby survived. The group deduce that, since all the suicides happened in the top floors of the building, that is where they will find any trace of spirits. They discover a staircase and make their way to the tenth floor as night falls.  Jake suggests the group split up, despite Andre's protests. Jake and Simon go off alone and find an office, where Simon finds and reads a suicide note; as he reads it, Jake begins experiencing a severe headache. Simon then asks Jake if he and Zoe are a couple. Jake becomes suddenly angry and attacks Simon before immediately returning to normal. A panicked Simon demands they leave the tower, but Jake begins screaming at him again. Meanwhile, Zoe, Judy, and Andre hear music and find an unplugged radio that somehow works. Zoe makes contact with a spirit, but when she begins asking questions, extremely loud screams fill the room and destroy their equipment and cellphones.  Jake awakens with his head bleeding and Simon nowhere to be found. He meets up with the others. Zoe and Andre want to leave, but Judy refuses to give up on their pilot and the chance at fame, and Jake agrees. They begin searching for Simon, only to discover that the tower seems to be changing, with doors and staircases vanishing, leaving them with no way to get down. Andre angrily confronts Jake, revealing that when they came to Farhope Tower as kids, Jake was possessed by a spirit and nearly killed Andre. Jake refuses to leave without Simon, but begins hearing voices telling him to "go up".  Zoe enters a room and begins screaming - the others find her with her leg snapped, and she says the room had no floor and she was falling. Zoe reveals she is pregnant with Jake's baby. Jake sees Simon at the end of the hall and the group attempt to follow; Andre becomes separated from the others and is possessed by a spirit who forces him to disembowel himself. The group find him as he dies. They try to find a way to get out of the tower, but Zoe is suddenly possessed and begins flailing and moaning before suddenly miscarrying the baby. She returns to normal and breaks down sobbing, and Jake tries to comfort her while a horrified Judy runs off.  Judy discovers Simon's GoPro camera on the floor and watches the footage, which reveals that Jake murdered Simon while being possessed by a spirit. Jake comes to find her and becomes possessed again, and he chases Judy through the hallway. Judy gets away, and a woman's voice tells Jake to "go up". Jake returns to Zoe and convinces her that going up is the only way to get out of the tower. Judy manages to end up on the roof of the tower, where a ghost possesses her and forces her to stab herself in the throat.  Simon and Zoe make their way to the penthouse. Zoe finds a photograph of the man and his wife from the opening scene, and realizes that Jake is the baby that survived and was given away - the spirits of Jake's mother and his mother's killer had been luring him there ever since Jake entered the tower as a child. Jake, possessed by the man's spirit, brutally beats Zoe to death. Jake then calmly gets a chair and a rope and hangs himself, mirroring the deaths of his mother and father.

The Final Girls
   Max Cartwright waits in the car while her actress mother, Amanda, auditions for a film. When she returns, Amanda complains that, for the rest of her career, she will be known for her role as [[scream queen]] Nancy in the 1986 [[slasher film]] ''Camp Bloodbath'', now a [[cult film|cult classic]]. On the way home, the two get into a car accident and Amanda is killed.  Three years later, on the anniversary of her mother's death, Max studies with her friends Gertie and Chris. Gertie's stepbrother Duncan, a horror film fan, shows up and persuades Max to attend a special double-feature showing of ''Camp Bloodbath'' and its sequel, ''Camp Bloodbath 2: Cruel Summer''. At the screening, Max is none too happy that Chris' possessive ex-girlfriend – and her former best friend – Vicki is also there. During the film, members of the audience accidentally set the theater ablaze. In order to get the group to safety, Max uses a [[machete]] to cut a hole in the screen and they all step through.  Max, Chris, Gertie, Duncan, and Vicki wake up in the woods. Every 92 minutes, they encounter a van with two characters from ''Camp Bloodbath'', and realize they have somehow been transported inside the movie. The group awkwardly pass themselves off as new camp counselors, and hitch a ride to camp. They let the first couple of murders happen without interference, but when Duncan is killed by the film's machete-wielding villain Billy Murphy, they realize that they too run the risk of becoming victims.  The group decides to stop the cast from having sex, as whenever someone does so in ''Camp Bloodbath'', they fall prey to Billy's machete. Chris distracts Kurt, while Max persuades Nancy to stay a virgin. Vicki sticks with Paula, the movie's [[final girl]] and Gertie bonds with Blake, a counselor. When Gertie brings up the topic of Billy Murphy, the counselors are alerted to the fact that the "[[urban legend]]" of Billy is "real" and will come to kill them. In a panic, the counselors try to flee the camp. Kurt and Paula drive off, but when Duncan emerges still alive, the car hits him then crashes into a totem pole, resulting in their deaths.  Now aware that the characters who originally survived the movie can die, Max and the others decide to save anyone they can. They dress Tina in a life jacket and mittens, to prevent her from undressing. They also decide that Max, the only remaining [[virgin]], is the new final girl, and plot to get Billy's machete into her hands so she can kill him and end the film. Meanwhile, Max and Nancy bond, and theorize that, if Nancy survives the movie, she can go back home with Max and be whomever she wants.  The group booby trap the cabin, then Tina lures Billy to them by performing a striptease. Tina panics and is killed when a trip wire sends her headfirst into a bear trap. Blake, Vicki and Gertie are killed fighting Billy. Chris, Nancy, and Max flee the cabin, and Billy chases after them. Chris is stabbed, and Billy kidnaps Nancy. Max finds her at Billy's barn hideout, and the two women fight him, which results in Max getting stabbed, before they both escape.  After the two retreat to the chapel, Max tells Nancy that her real life counterpart is Max's mother. They bid each other a tearful farewell before Nancy sacrifices herself by luring Billy with a striptease. Max collapses, but, now the final girl, she awakens with the power to kill Billy. They fight and she eventually decapitates him with his own machete. A wounded Chris arrives and the two kiss, while ''Camp Bloodbath'' closing credits play in the sky. Later, Max wakes to find herself in the hospital, where she is reunited with her friends. The group hears Billy Murphy's approach tune, and realize they are in the sequel, ''Camp Bloodbath 2: Cruel Summer''. Billy crashes through the glass doors of the hospital as the title appears.

Zheng decides to leave Tianjin and settle in Brazil. Chen, realizing that he and Geng are in danger owing to Madame Zou, offers to take Geng and leave Tianjin, but Madame Zou prohibits them, because she does not want to be perceived by the public as a bully. Instead, she allows Chen to open a school for a year, after which he must leave Tianjin, and sends thugs to assassinate Geng. When that fails, she sends Lin to attack Geng. Geng is stabbed and dumped in the countryside of Tianjin, but instead of seeking medical aid, he chooses to walk back into Tianjin, whereupon he dies of blood loss.  On the day when Chen is to open his school, he visits a tea-girl who tells him about what happened to Geng, and shows him one of Geng's books which has Geng's bloodstains inside the pages.

John—celebrating a year of sobriety after an addiction to drugs in his youth—blames himself for the crash, even though his brother and nephew assure him that the crash wasn’t his fault. John requests that the hospital return his amputated leg to him, intending to turn it into a shrine to his father as a way of coping with his grief.  John is surprised when, rather than return his leg and foot bones, the hospital gives him his entire amputated leg, including the flesh and muscle. John makes several failed attempts to skin the leg himself before deciding to mummify it. The leg ends up in a barbecue grill in John’s storage shed, undergoing a primitive mummification process.  John relapses into drug addiction after he begins drinking [[beer]] while taking the painkillers prescribed to him after his surgery. He spends the rent money for his storage shed on drugs, and the shed is put up for auction by its owner.  The shed is purchased by Shannon Whisnant, a local entrepreneur. When he discovers the leg, Whisnant sees it as an opportunity to fulfil his lifelong dream of being a rich and famous television personality. Whisnant begins spreading news of the leg in the local media, calling himself “The Leg Man” and expressing his desire to create a roadside attraction using it. When John learns of this, he makes contact with Whisnant to try and get the leg back. Whisnant agrees only to return ownership of the leg to John on the grounds that John allow him to display the leg, with both men collecting a profit. John initially agrees in an attempt to get Whisnant to turn the leg over to him, intending to reneg on the agreement later. When Whisnant learns of this, he refuses to turn the leg over and begins going on local radio to make fun of John and mock Tom’s death. Whisnant reveals that, as a child, his father was one of the few people in town not employed by Tom Wood’s furniture business, and that he has always resented never being invited to birthday parties at John’s house. Whisnant’s friends and family indicate that his desire to be a beloved celebrity stems from the severe physical and emotional abuse he suffered at the hands of his father.  Both men become fixated on the leg to the extent that it interferes with their personal lives. Depression over the incident leads John further into drug abuse, and he ends up homeless and living under a bridge. Whisnant becomes obsessed with marketing himself to the local community as “The Leg Man,” spending money on shirts, fliers, and other promotional merchandise for a business venture that doesn’t exist yet. His wife tells him that she is considering divorcing him due to his behavior; Whisnant retorts that he will be happy and productive once he is famous and has his own television show.  In 2006, [[Judge Mathis]] learns of the feud between the men and agrees to have them on his show. Mathis chastises Whisnant for his behavior and orders him to return the leg to John, but tells John that he must reimburse Whisnant $5,000 for the cost of the storage shed. Noticing that John has arrived to court high on drugs, Mathis offers to help him get treatment. John agrees and Mathis pays for him to go to a rehab facility. John successfully recovers from his addictions, returns to work, and gets engaged. An area vet agrees to taxidermy the leg for him, and John completes the memorial to his father.  Whisnant remains bitter over the loss of the leg and continues trying to make himself a local celebrity. He is hired to appear on a reality television show, but gets into an argument with the producers when he learns that aspects of the show are staged. He finally concludes that the barbecue grill he found the leg in is cursed, and decides that he can only lift the curse by throwing it into the ocean.

Jess cries as her limo drives off, leaving Nicky to climb into another waiting car.  Three years later, Nicky is in [[Buenos Aires]], working for billionaire motorsport team owner Rafael Garriga ([[Rodrigo Santoro]]). Garriga needs to beat a team headed by Australian businessman McEwen ([[Robert Taylor (Australian actor)|Robert Taylor]]) to win the championship. Nicky will pretend to be a disgruntled technician on Garriga's team willing to sell Garriga's custom fuel use algorithm EXR. Instead he will sell McEwen a bogus version which will slow their car down during the race. At a pre-race party, Nicky runs into Jess, who is now Garriga's girlfriend. After faking heavy drinking upon seeing Jess, Nicky has a convincing fight with Garriga in public and after being thrown out, is recruited by McEwen to provide the component.  Nicky begins pursuing Jess again, and they eventually rekindle their relationship. The head of Garriga's security entourage, Owens ([[Gerald McRaney]]), is suspicious and narrowly misses catching the two together. Nicky delivers the component to McEwen for three million [[euro]]s but also sells it to the other teams for similar amounts.  Nicky and Jess attempt to return to the United States together. However, they are caught by Garriga's men and taken to Garriga's garage. Jess is bound and gagged whilst Nicky is given a beating. Nicky has actually sold the real EXR to all of the various teams.  Garriga is convinced that Jess had something to do with Nicky gaining access to EXR and begins to suffocate Jess by holding her nose.  In order to save Jess, Nicky explains that he gained access to EXR through tricking Jess into believing he still had feelings for her.  That the necklace he had given to Jess was equipped to secretly record Garriga's password and login information.  He explains that Jess was conned and knew nothing about this.  However, Jess then reveals that she was only trying to seduce Garriga in order to steal [[Piaget SA|his valuable watch]] and to make Nicky jealous.  Nicky promises to come clean in order to spare Jess's life but Owens shoots him in the chest, causing a horrified Garriga to leave. Owens then reveals himself to be Nicky's father, Bucky, and assures Jess that he avoided any major arteries. He simply employed the "Toledo Panic Button." Bucky then tapes up Nicky's wounds and draws excess blood out of his son's chest with a metal plunger so that he can breathe again. They flee the garage in Garriga's vehicle.  Bucky drives Nicky and Jess to the hospital to treat Nicky's punctured lung and departs with Nicky's money as a reminder of the consequences of losing focus. After he leaves, Nicky notices that Jess snatched Garriga's watch before he left the warehouse, and a smiling Nicky and Jess then go into the hospital together.

Flying Colors (film)
 Sayaka Kudo is a [[gyaru]] who wears [[miniskirt]]s and dyes her hair blonde. Although she is a second year [[senior high school]] student, she is on par academically with 4th grade elementary school students. She frequently transfers between schools because she is unable to make friends; she was once suspended for being caught with cigarettes. Eventually she attends a private all-girls high school where she plays and enjoys her extra-scholarly activities while skipping study altogether.  To prepare her for her university [[entrance examination]], her mother sends her to Seiho Cram School. However, when the school director, Yoshitaka Tsubota, hears about Sayaka's academic problem, he makes it his personal goal to help her enter the university of her choice — [[Keio University]] is considered one of the most difficult to enter in Japan — and to get back at her father.  Her father (whose main goal is to get her brother Ryuta into pro baseball) labels her an "air-head" and says she and her mother are being scammed by the cram school. Sayaka becomes determined to study hard to prove him wrong. Over the course of the summer holidays of her second year through to the exams at the end of her third year in high school, Sayaka studies extremely hard. She goes without sleep to the extent that she nods off in her classes. She even dyes her hair back to black and cuts it to show her resolve. Her results progressively improve on practice tests and her academic [[Standard deviation|deviation value]] increases tremendously from 30 to 70 in this short span of time.  
Flight World War II
  Airline Pilot Captain William Strong ([[Faran Tahir]]) is flying International Airlines Flight 42 from Washington, D.C. to London. Among the passengers are two World War 2 historians attending an event in London. Air traffic control notifies the pilots of clear skies, but, moments later, they come across an electromagnetic storm. With their instruments malfunctioning, they have no choice but to enter the storm and unknowingly enter a wormhole. The wormhole transports them back to 1940. Strong assures the passengers that they are safe. The plane flies in the dark for some time before coming across German strike aircraft bombing Dunkirk. Strong escapes the chaos, and assures the passengers of their safety. Meanwhile, the historians, through their observations, discover that what they have been experiencing line up with what happened during World War 2 and the storm had transported them back to this time. They attempt to convince the pilots and the crew. Meanwhile, a suspicious passenger overhears the ensuing argument and eavesdrops.   Amidst his disbelief, Strong gets into contact with a British Army radio operator in France, Corporal Nigel Sheffield, but both men find each other's story unbelievable. Strong and the historians are later able to convince Nigel and his superiors with their advanced information that they are truly from the future. Upon questioning Sheffield they discover that history has not gone as it should; the Dunkirk evacuation was apparently a complete disaster for the Allies (when history dictates that the bulk of the Allied forces there were evacuated successfully), and the Germans somehow have the advanced Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter, historically only operational in 1944, in 1940. They conclude that the Germans have somehow accelerated their technological advancement and are much closer to victory than they historically were. The historians are attempting to think up a way to help the Allies win and correct history when the eavesdropping passenger loudly announces what he has learned and tries to persuade others to hijack the aircraft and kill Hitler. This escalates into a fight, but the overzealous passenger and his faction are subdued.  As the crew and passengers struggle to choose their next move, Sheffield notifies Strong of incoming Me 262s which had been ordered to shoot him down. The jets take the aircraft under fire, and the airliner sustains damage even as Strong undergoes evasive action. They manages the evade the attackers momentarily, but only after taking serious damage and the co-pilot is wounded. Desperate and under persuasion from other crew members, Strong reveals the truth to the passengers and asks for assistance. With their help, part of the aircraft's systems is repaired. When contact with Corporal Sheffield is recovered, they learn through him that the Allies also do not have radar as they were supposed to. After yet another German attack, the historians believe that they were 'sent' here to change history themselves; they were to be the ones who gave the Allies radar.  Strong and the others come up with the idea to cut out the aircraft's modern radar out of the nose and airdrop it to Corporal Sheffield's unit so they can use it to assist both themselves and the Allied war effort. German ground forces attempt to intercept the airdrop, but British troops defeat them and successfully retrieve and put the set to use. Suddenly, the German fighters return and hit the airliner with a missile, punching a hole in its hull and killing some of the passengers. Sheffield then uses the airliner's radar to direct Strong's piloting to escape, but he is unable to shake off the German jets. The airliner is about to be destroyed when British Hurricane fighters arrive and drive the Germans away, confirming to the crew that they are truly in 1940.   Unexpectedly, a storm like the one that brought them to 1940 appears. Bidding farewell to Corporal Sheffield, Strong pilots the plane through it and return to the modern day. Captain Strong eventually manages to glide the plane to a safe landing, discovering that they have landed in Berlin, fortunately not under Nazi control. As the passengers exit the plane, Strong moves to assist an older man writing in his notebook. When the man stands up and closes his notebook, Strong notices that it is addressed to "Nigel Sheffield III." While Strong stares in amazement, the old man tells him that "there's no time like the present" and leaves.

The Fourth Direction
 The film plot synthesises two different stories set in a post-[[Operation Blue Star]] Punjab in the '80s. Fear and paranoia pervade the atmosphere as the general public is caught between excesses of both [[Khalistan movement|Khalistani]] militants and the Indian government forces fighting them. The first story is about a militant diktat in Punjab that prohibited family-owned dogs from barking, and the other is about two Hindu friends travelling to Amritsar in a nearly empty train. The film merges the two plots into one by making one of the friends travelling in the train recount the first story.<ref></ref>  The film opens with two Hindu friends Jugal and Raj looking for a train to Amritsar late in the evening. Having missed the last passenger train, they, along with a Sikh man in the same position, force their way onto a freight train. The small compartment already has a security man and two other young Sikhs besides a couple of train employees. The fearful atmosphere makes Jugal recount to Raj an earlier incident involving him, his wife and their young daughter.  The film goes into flashback. Lost at night in the countryside, Jugal, his wife and daughter reach a farmhouse in the outskirts of the village. While they are frightened to knock at the isolated house, they are not left with much choice. The family in the house, also suspicious at first, later lets them in, as the head of the house Joginder shows them the direction to take.  Later at night, Joginder and his family are visited by the Sikh militants who demand Joginder that he kill the family dog for drawing attention with its incessant barking. The family woes continue the next morning when the paramilitary men arrive looking for the separatists. They turn the house upside down before leaving.  The narrative moves back to the train on its way as the guard asks his unwanted passengers to leave before anyone notices them.<ref name=ti1></ref><ref name=ti2></ref>  
The Forbidden Room (2015 film)
 The film's [[frame story]], and the narrative it returns to the most, concerns a [[submarine]] crew transporting a volatile substance that will explode if they ever resurface. As the crew struggle to survive with low [[oxygen]] levels, a [[Lumberjack|woodsman]] ([[Roy Dupuis]]) mysteriously forces his way onto the vessel; the crew believe his sudden appearance may lead to an escape from their predicament. The men navigate a labyrinth of rooms and passageways while trying to access the captain's chamber. Along the way, they recount stories that lead to other stories, which unfold in the complex and layered manner of a [[Matryoshka doll]]. The most important of these "sub-stories" shows the woodsman and his fellow "[[sapling]]-jacks" trying to rescue a woman named Margot from depraved kidnappers. Other sub-stories involve: a surgeon kidnapped by a team of "women skeletons" who work as [[Insurance fraud|insurance defrauders]]; a madman on a train under the charge of a womanizing psychiatrist; a [[mustache]] that seeks to comfort the widow of the man whose face it used to adorn; and a doctor cursed by a bust of [[Janus]]. The submarine crew finally reach the captain's "forbidden room", only to find him incapacitated. Most of the men die of [[asphyxiation]], but the woodsman finds that the volatile cargo has transformed into his love, Margot. A passionate kiss leads into a montage of proposed endings from "The Book of Climaxes", and an abrupt, inconclusive ending to the film itself.

On Gault's recommendation, Luanne offers Laine a job as a waitress at the motel's diner.  Laine turns it down and requests a free room for the night instead.  Although offended her offer was rejected, Luanne agrees.  Before going to sleep, Laine sneaks into the adjoining room.  As Laine steals a necklace and a bottle of sedatives, the couple staying there return to their room.  Laine hides in the closet, where she overhears them discuss a completed heist.

But they are mysteriously returned – except the most corrupt officer, who is hanged in public. The police get a CD from mystery man 'Gabbar' who says his mission is to target corrupt officers. Police driver Sadhuram ([[Sunil Grover]]) is convinced that he can crack the mystery of who is Gabbar – but his superior officers humiliate and insult him in front of all the other officers.  On his way home, Professor Aditya Singh Rajput ([[Akshay Kumar]]) is stopped by lawyer Shruti ([[Shruti Haasan]]), who makes him drive her and a pregnant woman to the hospital, but the woman delivers in the car with Shruti's help. When Shruti wants to thank Aditya for helping her, she finds he has already left. Sadhuram finds from the [[tehsil]] to the [[district]] offices that there's one honest officer in each department. He is convinced that all these honest officers have a link to Gabbar. Shruti and Aditya become close and one day, she gets hit by a scooter and Aditya takes her to Patil Hospital. Although not badly injured, doctors at Patil Hospital insist on taking expensive tests and Aditya realizes how helpless patients and their families are fleeced and often, inhumanly treated. A poor woman mourns her deceased husband in the civil hospital nearby. Aditya tells her he'll get her medical insurance. He deliberately checks in her dead husband as a patient to Patil Hospital. The hospital tries to swindle money out of Aditya by pretending to treat the already dead man, making Aditya pay heavily for tests and medicines. Aditya then shows them the death certificate, which proves that they knowingly admitted a dead man. The young owner of the hospital, Vikas Patil is furious when Aditya releases the video of the hospital's corruption to the media. However, Vikas is brutally and mercilessly murdered by an angry mob. His father, a powerful builder Digvijay Patil ([[Suman Talwar]]), sees Aditya in the hospital CCTV footage and is stunned to realize that this is the same man he had supposedly killed five years ago.  Aditya and Shruti attend a wedding where Aditya remembers his late wife Sunaina ([[Kareena Kapoor Khan]]) and how they moved into a new apartment when they were expecting a baby. While Aditya was outside playing [[Holi]], the buildings in the colony collapsed and killed hundreds of people, including his wife and unborn child. Aditya collected proof of the faulty buildings against builder Digivijay Patil, but Patil bribed everyone and no one was willing to hear Aditya out. Digvijay tried to bribe Aditya by offering Rs one crore to spare the matter but Aditya spurned the offer and beat Digvijay severely but the latter attacked him with an axe and thought his blows had killed Aditya. However, a bus full of medical students found the unconscious Aditya on a highway and save his life. He then decides to use the power of young, idealistic, honest youth and trains students at National College to join his cause. Meanwhile, Sadhuram  finds out that all the honest officers attended National College for graduation. Shruti finds out Aditya as Gabbar and is shocked but when he tells her the truth, she supports his cause.  CBI officer Kuldeep Pahwa ([[Jaideep Ahlawat]]) takes charge of the case and is mystified by the facts. He listens to Sadhuram's findings and they arrest National College students. But even upon being beaten, the students do not divulge anything about Gabbar. Shruti tells Kuldeep that because the law doesn't work, a vigilante like Gabbar is a hero for ordinary citizens today. Sadhuram changes his view of Gabbar. Patil kills an honest officer to terrorize others into passing his faulty building plans. The cops are sure that Gabbar will target Patil for this outrageous act – and he does. Patil throws a birthday party for himself at his farmhouse. As he cuts the cake, he spots Aditya in the crowd. The next moment, Aditya and his gang kidnap him, all wearing similar masks. As police search the city for Patil in vain, Aditya takes him to Patil's own mansion and tells him to call anyone to save himself – but the Home Minister tells him to not involve him, so that Gabbar doesn't come after him next. Aditya and Patil then have a violent clash and he kills Patil.  Aditya goes to the police to hand himself over for the murders. He is given the death penalty but there are huge public protests and enraged students block his jail van. Officer Pahwa requests him to speak to the students and he does, telling them to channel their anger against corruption and be the change society needs. As Aditya is taken to be hanged, Shruti breaks down, but he leaves, smiling, asking the hangman, ''Tera kya hoga, Kaalia''- quoting the famous dialogue of the character Gabbar from the film [[Sholay (1975 film)|Sholay]].

Reese Houser is excited, as this gives him a chance to grow closer to his crush Pfeifer Ross. His friend Ryan Shoos is dismissive of the play, and comes up with the idea to vandalize the set. Reese is reluctant to take part, but agrees when Ryan promises that he'll be able to console Pfeifer afterwards, giving them a chance to kiss.  Later that night, Reese, Ryan, and Ryan's girlfriend Cassidy Spilker sneak into the school, only to run into Pfeifer, who saw Reese's car. Knowing they cannot vandalize the sets with Pfeifer there, the group tries to leave, but finds that they have been locked inside, and there is no cell phone reception. Disturbed, Cassidy admits the trio's real reason for being in the school, which angers Pfeifer.  As the group tries to look for a way out of the school, they find news coverage of Charlie's death that includes an interview with his girlfriend Alexis. They also discover that Charlie was not supposed to have performed that day, and was only on stage because he was the understudy for the main actor, Reese's father Rick.  The group becomes separated when Reese runs off with the camera, with Ryan being left alone. As he searches for Reese, he sees various things, such as a half finished plate of food, a cup of coffee, a hidden room with a mattress and bed frame, and what looks like a body hanging from above. When the group is reunited, they hear footsteps above them that stop above Cassidy. She is then yanked into the air by seemingly nothing, leaving her with burns on her neck that look like rope burns.  They all come back to the stage, where Pfeifer points out an air conditioning duct that they can escape through. Angry and frightened, Ryan calls for Charlie, terrifying the group. When he climbs up a ladder to reach the vent, he is thrown off by an unseen force, and his leg is badly broken. When Reese, Pfeifer, and Cassidy leave Ryan, the door is slammed shut, and they are locked out of the stage where Ryan lays helpless. The group eventually get on stage, finding only Ryan's phone. The audience then sees footage from the phone.  Ryan sees the door slam, then a figure holding a noose. The figure disappears before he is pulled away by the neck by a fly rig. As the night progresses Cassidy is killed by Charlie Grimille dressed as the Hangman, a character from "The Gallows." Reese and Pfeifer unsuccessfully try to escape the spirit and end up on the stage, where the spirit begins to choke her. Realizing that the spirit is Charlie and that he wants them to act out the final scene (in which Reese and Charlie's characters are hanged), Reese and Pfeifer reenact the scene. However, when Reese puts the noose around his neck for the final portion, he is hanged and killed by Charlie. Once he is dead, Pfeifer and Charlie, now appearing as an adult, both bow, and Alexis, who was watching the performance, gives a standing ovation.  The police enter a house where Pfeifer and Alexis are residing and watching footage of Charlie's death, indicating that Pfeifer is the daughter of Charlie and Alexis. When one of the officers attempts to question Pfeifer and Alexis about Charlie, Pfeifer warns him, saying, "You shouldn't say that name." The officer then calls for his partner, who witnesses him being dragged by a noose, killing him.

Get Hard
 James King is an extremely wealthy [[hedge fund]] manager at Barrow Funds, run by Martin Barrow. He is engaged to Barrow's daughter Alissa. James has come to know Darnell Lewis, a car wash attendant who accidentally frightened James in a parking lot. Darnell and  Rita are trying to put their daughter Makayla in a better school, away from the bad neighborhood they live in.  During an engagement party for James and Alissa, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] arrive and arrest James for [[fraud]] and [[embezzlement]]. James' lawyer, Peter Penny, urges him to go for a guilty plea and a likely short sentence, but James refuses and insists that he will be exonerated. Instead, James is found guilty and sentenced to ten years in [[San Quentin State Prison]], with the judge giving him 30 days to get his affairs in order. Though forbidden from crossing county lines, James wants to flee the country with Alissa, but she dumps him.  James encounters Darnell and, assuming he has been incarcerated before because he is black, begs him for help and agrees to pay him $30,000 to toughen him up for prison. Darnell, who has little idea of how to act tough, trains James by pepper-spraying him, trying to get him to develop a "mad dog" face, and creating scenarios in which James must defend himself, but all of these efforts fail miserably. During the training, James gets in touch with Barrow and says he is getting help. Barrow, the actual crook, thinks James is onto him and orders a hitman named Gayle to monitor him.  With no sign that James is toughening up, Darnell figures that James should be prepared in other ways for prison and takes him to a gay hookup spot for James to learn how to perform [[oral sex]] in prison. James can't go through with it and tells Darnell that he will keep going and do whatever it takes to "get hard". James starts to work out harder and faster, makes [[Shiv (weapon)|shiv]]s, and learns "keistering" (smuggling [[contraband]] in the [[anus]]). Darnell simulates a prison raid with help from James' domestic staff. In the chaos, James gets a shiv stuck in his head, so Darnell takes James to his home for Rita to treat it. He has dinner and listens to Darnell make up a story of how he went to prison, which is just a retelling of ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]''.  James and Darnell resolve for James to join a local gang called the Crenshaw Kings to gain protection in prison. However, Darnell's cousin Russell, the gang leader, rebuffs James and redirects him to the [[white supremacist|Alliance of Whites]] gang. James is unable to be a convincing racist, leading the gang to think he is a cop, but Darnell rescues him by bursting in with a flamethrower.  Darnell and James finally deduce that Barrow is the crook. They sneak into his office and find the embezzlement records on Barrow's computer. Unfortunately, Gayle finds them and takes back the computer, while informing James that Darnell has never been in prison. Dejected, James returns to the Crenshaw Kings on his own. They accept him and order him to kill someone as their initiation. Darnell arrives in time to convince James to expose Barrow. The two sneak onto Barrow's [[yacht]] to retrieve the computer, only to come across Gayle and his men. James unleashes a series of [[capoeira]] moves on them before Barrow and Alissa arrive, both confessing to the fraud and embezzlement, a scheme that also included Peter. They try to convince James to run away with them, but he turns them down and heads to a life raft with Darnell. When Gayle shoots the life raft, James pulls out a gun he had "keistered" and aims it at Gayle. U.S. Marshals suddenly appear, summoned by the [[ankle monitor]] that James triggered, having worn it past the county line.  Barrow's computer provides the evidence needed to clear James. Barrow, Gayle, Alissa, and Barrow's henchmen are taken away by the Marshals and James is cleared of all charges. However, he gets arrested for his unlicensed gun. Darnell's training helps James through his six-month prison sentence - something that Barrow is unprepared for as he is quickly attacked by inmates when his own lengthy San Quentin sentence begins. James spends his sentence helping the FBI retrieve all the assets that Barrow stole, while guiding Darnell's investments so that he and Rita are able to open their own carwash. As Darnell drives James home after his release, James announces his intent to celebrate his freedom with a ''Wall Street Journal'' and a [[Malt liquor#Forty-Ounce|forty]], which he now considers a perfect Sunday.

In the bedroom, Colleen and Chris are talking and she decides to go to bed. Chris heads downstairs and sees the front door open. After approaching the door, he sees Rose lying on the ground, covered by a towel and dead. He runs back inside calling for Peter and tries to call 911, when the power goes out.

While trying to settle into the new neighborhood, Zach meets a girl his age named Hannah and her overprotective father 'Mr. Shivers'. Zach and Hannah become quick friends, but Mr. Shivers frequently warns Zach to avoid contact with them. At Madison High School where Gale works as the vice-principal, Zach befriends Champ, a socially awkward student.  The following day as Zach is taking out the trash, Hannah appears behind him. When Zach inquires why he did not see her at school she replies that she is home-schooled by her father. Hannah then takes Zach to an abandoned amusement park where the two climb the Ferris wheel and bond in one of the carriages before returning home where they are discovered by Hannah's father. Mr. Shivers warns Zach once again to stay away or something very bad will happen before disappearing behind the fence. Later that same night, Zach hears Mr. Shivers and Hannah arguing, followed by Hannah screaming and something crashing. Zach calls the police, but Mr. Shivers assures the officers that the noise came from his television. Zach returns home with his mother who leaves shortly after, to go to the school's Homecoming Dance, leaving Zach home alone with his Aunt Lorraine. Fearing Hannah is in danger, Zach tricks Mr. Shivers into going to the police station for further questioning and breaks into his house with Champ's help through the basement. The two then enter Mr. Shiver's study where they find a shelf containing numerous "[[Goosebumps]]" manuscripts—all locked. In response to Champ's curiosity, Zach unlocks one of the books, but when Hannah discovers them, Zach drops it and releases the snowman from "[[The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena]]". They pursue the monster to an ice skating rink, where they attempt to trap the snowman back in the book. As the trio are eventually cornered without the manuscript, Mr. Shivers appears behind the snowman and imprisons it back into the book.  On the way home, Mr. Shivers unintentionally reveals that he is Goosebumps author [[R.L. Stine]]. Once they return home he tells Hannah to pack up her things because they are moving away once again. Upon Zach's insistence, Stine explains how he created the stories as a child to terrorize the people that made fun of him, but the monsters came to life and became uncontrollable, so he trapped them in the manuscripts. Returning to the study, they find an angered [[Slappy the Dummy|Slappy]], from "[[Night of the Living Dummy]]", waiting for them. Slappy burns his own manuscript as revenge for imprisonment and flees with all of the books intent on releasing all of the monsters, escaping in the Haunted Car from the book of the same name, after having released it.

Stine created her to cope with his loneliness even though she does not know it, and doesn't expect Zach to understand his intention. Zach then reveals that he does understand with him losing his father. Hannah appears, telling them how they found the typewriter. Stine acquires the typewriter and starts writing a new story based on the events around them, while Slappy releases the rest of the Goosebumps monsters outside on the school football field. Zach tries to warn the students about the events going on outside before the praying mantis attacks the school frightening the students. Slappy then rallies all of the monsters to attack the school together in order to get to Stine and stop him, while Zach leads the students in fending off all the released monsters storming the building. Meanwhile, the monsters finally enter the school with help of the Annihilator 3000 from "[[Toy Terror: Batteries Included]]". Slappy soon finds and confronts Stine, breaking his fingers with the typewriter case before the story is finished.  As the students and staff at the high school continue to fend the monsters off, the group boards a school bus and head to the abandoned amusement park. The monsters follow in pursuit and catch up with the school bus. However it is revealed to be a decoy with the group, who're waiting for their plan to work. Upon opening the doors, the school bus explodes and temporarily destroys the monsters giving the group more time to escape. At the park, the group take refuge in the fun house where Zach continues to type the story as Stine is telling it to him. Slappy soon tracks them and after revealing how he and Stine are the same persona, releases the blob from "[[The Blob that Ate Everyone]]". Stine hands the book and typewriter to Zach and distracts the blob by allowing it to devour him. The group then climbs to the top of the ferris wheel where Zach finishes the story. However, when Slappy notices the book is not with Stine, he has the monsters attack the Ferris wheel making it fall off its hinges and roll violently out of the park. As the group climbs out, Hannah insists Zach to open the book but Zach is reluctant to open the book because Hannah will also be sucked inside it. Revealing she knew the truth about herself all along, Hannah opens the book, sucking Slappy and all the other monsters into it; she bids farewell to Zach with a kiss before she is also sucked in.  Months later, Stine is the new substitute English teacher and is in a relationship with Lorraine. After class, as Zach reminisces about Hannah to Stine, Stine reveals Hannah in the hallway. Stine explains that he wrote her back into existence with one more book. Hannah and Zach kiss and leave school together while Stine burns Hannah's manuscript, making her permanently real. As Stine is about to leave school, he hears the click of the typewriter typing by itself inside its display case. Much to his horror, Brent Green has evaded imprisonment and begins to write a new Goosebumps book titled "The Invisible Boy's Revenge".  
The Good Dinosaur
  In an [[alternate history]], the asteroid that would have caused [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|the extinction of the]] [[dinosaur]]s 65 million years ago passes safely over [[Earth]].  Sixty-five million years later, ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' farmers Henry and Ida have children Libby, Buck, and the runt Arlo, who has trouble adjusting to farm life. While his successful siblings are allowed to "make their mark" (a mud-print on the family's corn [[silo]]), Arlo's timid nature makes tasks difficult for him. Henry attempts to give Arlo a sense of purpose by putting him in charge of guarding their silo, and helps him set a trap. It captures a feral [[Caveman|caveboy]], but Arlo doesn't have the heart to kill him, and sets him free. Disappointed, Henry takes Arlo to track the caveboy, leading them into a ravine. Henry saves Arlo from a [[flash flood]] before being swept away and killed.  Without his father, Arlo shoulders more of the workload. He spots the same caveboy inside the silo and, blaming him for his father's death, chases him until both fall into a river. Arlo cannot swim, and is swept downstream where he hits his head on a rock and is knocked unconscious. Awakening, he finds himself far from home and tries to survive on his own, but becomes trapped when a boulder pins his leg. The next day Arlo wakes to find his leg has been freed, and the caveboy appears with food for him. The caveboy then leads Arlo to a berry tree, where the caveboy fends off a large snake, amazing Arlo and impressing a nearby eccentric ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' who wants to keep the boy. He forces Arlo to compete with him to give the boy a name he will respond to, which Arlo finally wins when he calls him "Spot". Arlo and Spot bond as Arlo laments his lost family, and Spot reveals that his own parents are dead. Later, when a storm strikes, Arlo runs away in fear and loses the riverbank he has been following home.  The next morning, Arlo wakes to find Spot at his side. They are noticed by a band of [[pterosaur|pterodactyls]], led by Thunderclap, who appear to be conducting a rescue operation but turn out to be savagely carnivorous. When the pterodactyls try to take Spot, Arlo and Spot flee, happening upon a pair of ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' named Nash and Ramsey, who ward off the pterodactyls. Nash, Ramsey, and their father Butch have lost their herd of longhorns, so Arlo offers Spot's help in sniffing them out. They locate the herd, but Butch recognizes the work of [[Cattle raiding|cattle rustlers]], and uses Arlo as a lure. Arlo and Spot attract the attention of rustler ''[[Velociraptor]]'', allowing Butch and his family to attack. During the fight, Arlo musters his courage and fends off two raptors who have overwhelmed Butch, helping to turn the fight in their favor. Having gained their respect, Arlo joins the ''Tyrannosaurus'' in driving the cattle south when he sees the familiar mountain peaks of his homeland in the distance, and leaves with Spot to return home. Along the way, they encounter an adult feral caveman in the distance, and though Spot shows interest, Arlo dissuades him and they continue on.  As another storm approaches, Thunderclap and the pterodactyls return and attack and carry Spot away. Arlo becomes entangled in vines, where he has a vision of Henry leading him home. Arlo instead resolves to save Spot, making the vision of his father proud before it fades away. Arlo finds and attacks the pterodactyls, who have cornered Spot at the river. Arlo and Spot together plunge Thunderclap and the pterodactyls into the water, where they are swept helplessly downstream. When another flash flood occurs, Arlo leaps into the water to rescue Spot as the two are swept away toward a waterfall. Arlo protects Spot as the two plummet down the fall, and carries him to shore.  As they approach Arlo's home, the two again hear the unknown caveman call, and are approached by an entire cave family. With great reluctance, Arlo pushes Spot to join his adoptive family, and the two of them share a tearful goodbye.  Arlo finally arrives home to his mother and siblings, and makes his mark on the silo between those of his mother and father.  
Gopala Gopala (2015 film)
 Kanneganti Gopala Rao is an atheist who owns a shop selling Hindu idols alongside his wife Meenakshi and son Moksha as well as his assistant Otthu. He obstructs a holy ritual involving his family, conducted by Siddheswar Maharaj, a fake [[Godman (India)|godman]]. A sudden earthquake destroys his shop.  Rao approaches his insurance company who deny him assistance, claiming that an earthquake is an act of God. Rao decides to sue God but cannot find a lawyer willing to take the case on. He eventually engages Akbar Bhai, a disabled lawyer, who helps him file the case. Legal notices are sent to the insurance company as well as to Siddheshwar the priest and others from his group, as representatives of God. The court accepts the case, but Rao finds himself trapped among armed fundamentalists, with a creditor Ramji occupying the house and his wife having left him.  Rao is rescued by Gopala Govinda Hari, a consultant, who is revealed to the audience to be the deity [[Vishnu]], under his incarnation [[Krishna]] in disguise. Gopala buys Rao's house from Ramji but allows Rao to stay with him. The lawsuit caused a public outcry, so on Gopala's advice, Rao gives an interview to the media about his views, which turns viral; public opinion swings in his favour. Hundreds of people whose insurance claims were rejected due to an Act of God clause turn up at Akbar's house and join the fight. Rao agrees to fight on behalf of all of them.  In the next court session, defending lawyer Shankar Narayana points out that Rao has no document that can prove the disaster was an Act of God. The judge orders Rao to present a written proof that will support his claim. Gopala gives Rao the [[Bhagavad Gita]], [[Bible]] and [[Quran]] in which to find the answers. Rao subsequently points out a passage saying that "This world is a creation of God, and it is his will to allow it to grow or destroy", which strengthens his case. As he nears the end of his argument, he is stabbed by a staunch follower of Leeladhara.  Rao is rushed to the hospital where he slips into a coma due to heavy blood loss. Leeladhara then plans to make Rao a messenger of God and elevate him to a divine figure across the country after killing him. The lawsuit's verdict goes in Rao's favour and religious organisations are ordered by the court to pay the compensation to all the plaintiffs. After a month, Rao is rescued by Gopala, who later reveals his identity as [[Lord Vishnu]] by showing his [[Vishvarupa|Vishwaroopam]]. Rao starts to believe in the existence of God. Meanwhile, Leeladhara, Gopika Matha, and Siddheshwar open a temple dedicated to Rao and accumulate millions in donations. Rao learns that his death is planned for [[Vijayadashami]] which coincides with the death of [[Sai Baba of Shirdi|Shirdi Sai Baba]]. He escapes with Gopala but is attacked by the priests' henchmen. Gopala manages to show them his 4th incarnation [[Lord Narasimha]] in place of Rao, scaring them off.  Rao arrives to find his statues erected at the place where his shop once stood. He wades through the stunned crowd and breaks the statue, then admonishes the crowd about trusting in godmen. He advises them to search for God inside themselves rather than worshipping statues. Rao prevents the crowd from attacking the priests, asking for them to be allowed to leave unharmed but also insisting that they stop believing in them. After the completion of [[Ramlila]], Rao goes back to Gopala to thank him, only to find him gone.  Rao's family arrive and they are reunited. He sees Gopala's key chain on the floor. When he is about to take it back, he hears Gopala's voice telling him to get rid of it. He throws it away, seeing it disappear into the sky with a flash as Gopala "signs off", promising him they will meet again.  
Grandma (film)
 Elle is a lesbian poet coping with the recent death of her long-term life partner. She ends a four-month relationship with a younger admirer, Olivia, telling her their relationship meant nothing, before receiving a visit from her 18-year-old granddaughter Sage. Sage is pregnant and requests $630 for an [[abortion]], which is scheduled for that afternoon. As Elle is broke and Sage has had her credit card confiscated by her overbearing mother, the two embark on a road trip across [[Los Angeles]] to try and come up with the money.  Elle forcefully extorts $50 from the father of the child, and then tries to call in a $400 debt from her friend Deathy, a tattoo artist. Because she is also broke at the time, Deathy cannot help them beyond some $60 she borrows from the register, but gives Elle a new tattoo that looks like the letter "O". Sage presumes this to be Olivia's initial, though Elle insists it is only meant to be a circle. Elle tries to sell some of her rare books to an acquaintance, Carla, who owns a café, but gets into a fight with Olivia, who is working there. Elle storms out when Carla, who is much more tech-savvy than Elle, gauges the price of the books on [[eBay]] and offers her a paltry $60, and Olivia berates her as they leave.  Becoming desperate, Elle and Sage visit Elle's ex-husband Karl, whom Elle has not seen in decades. She tells him she needs to borrow the money for rent, and he requests a kiss in return. This leads to an argument over how Elle ended their relationship, but when she pleads with him, he agrees to hand over the cash. When he asks her to be honest about the reason for needing the money, she tells him that Sage needs an abortion, and Karl becomes angry and emotional. Elle once aborted his child without telling him, yet went on to give birth to a baby born from a one-night stand. She explains that she wanted a child but not a husband, and Karl angrily insists he will not pay for an abortion.  Sage and Elle work up the courage to visit Sage's busy single mother, Judy, who is furious to learn Sage is pregnant. Judy reluctantly produces the money and Elle drives Sage to the abortion clinic. After the procedure, Judy forgives Sage and takes her home. On her own way home, Elle giggles and rejoices at memories of her partner Violet. Before reaching home, she makes a short stop at Olivia's house to apologize for saying their relationship meant nothing. Afterwards, Elle walks down the sidewalk, laughing on her way home.  
Goodbye Mr. Loser
 Unemployed amateur musician Xia Luo (Shen Teng) attends the wedding of Qiu Ya (Wang Zhi), his high school crush. He overdrinks, makes an inebriated declaration of love to Qiu Ya, and angers his wife Ma Dongmei (Ma Li), who publicly shames him for being a poor provider and husband.  After causing chaos as his wife pursues him through the wedding hall, Xia Luo locks himself into a bathroom at the wedding venue, flies into a rage of self-hatred and passes out, waking up in his teenage body in his middle-school classroom in 1997. Thinking he is in a dream, he impulsively beats up his teacher, sets fire to the classroom, and kisses Qiu Ya, then jumps out a window to end the dream. But after waking up in hospital and realising he is still in 1997, Xia Luo is forced to make the best of things.  Although Xia Luo appears his normal teenage self to everyone else in 1997, he retains all his memories of adult life, including around twenty years of as yet unwritten pop music—which he decides to present as his own work, to gain fame and to win the heart of Qiu Ya. Over the next twenty years he becomes a pop megastar in China, taking the place of other superstar singers from the original 1990s to 2000s timeline, including 'ghostwriting' famous TV themes for pop radio, duetting with [[Sarah Brightman]] at the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympic]] opening ceremony in place of [[Liu Huan]] and producing and judging for a popular music talent TV series (based on The Voice).  Having achieved all of his ambitions including marrying Qiu Ya, Xia Luo gradually realizes that he was destined to be with Ma Dongmei—after he abandoned her in middle school in the new timeline, she nevertheless defended him from bullies and troublemakers and was forced into a simple life in a small apartment, eventually marrying Da Chun, one of Xia Luo's kindly but slow-witted classmates from 1997.  As time goes on, Xia Luo gradually runs out songs from his original time to claim as his own, and his own written songs were criticized as lacking talent. He eventually announces his retirement and starts wasting his money on drugs and women. He also discovers Qiu Ya having an affair with another friend. Disappointed with how his life is turning out, Xia Luo makes a proposal to Da Chun, wanting to trade away all he owns in exchange for his wife, but the frustrated husband punches him into unconsciousness and he wakes up in a hospital bed, where it is discovered he is dying from AIDS. As Xia Luo's health deteriorates, Ma Dongmei sings a final love song to him in his hospital bed, revealing that it was always her favourite, even though he was serenading Qiu Ya with it in the classroom at the time (this song is also the only song Xia Luo truly wrote himself).   At the moment of his death, Xia Luo awakes and finds himself back in the wedding venue bathroom where he realizes that Ma Dongmei is the true love of his life. He runs back into the room and embraces her, which he continues to do as they are both arrested and taken to the local police station. He resumes his normal life much as before but with a new devotion to Ma Dongmei.  The film contains many references to Chinese popular culture in the late 1990s and early 2000s, including cameo appearances and depictions of well-known pop stars of that era. Some celebrities appear as themselves (including [[Jay Chou]] as a talent show contestant on The Voice, who performed a song Xia Luo had allegedly written, in reality one that Xia Luo had plagiarized from him), whilst others are depicted through stand-ins (for instance, [[Na Ying|Miss Na]], who talent-spots Xia Luo in the new 1997 timeline).

Anson, his brother Stef ([[Jimmi Simpson]]), and Stef's girlfriend Mimi ([[Lily Cole]]) (the latter two having been at a table making out earlier) then appear and quickly take the employees hostage, tying them to chairs. Apparently uninterested in money, their true intentions soon become clear - they are [[Sexual sadism disorder|sadists]] and [[cannibal]]s, who plan to torture and eat the various employees.  Stef soon chains up Yannick in the kitchen to cook the various employees as they are dispatched in different sick and sadistic games. After the trio eat Chuy, Kerry pretends to be romantically interested in Anson to gain his trust, and comes onto him while retrieving a list of items from the pantry for Yannick to cook with.  However while eating Winketta's corpse Stef starts to experience [[Anaphylaxis|anaphylactic shock]], and realizes Yannick has snuck basil into his food, which he had forbid earlier as he is highly allergic.

Back in the kitchen, after a long battle with both parties sustaining horrible wounds, Stef manages to kill Yannick. Mimi kills Cricket, but Kerry manages to kill her, and just as it appears Hector will kill Anson, Anson kills Hector instead.  Anson and Kerry reunite and head into the kitchen, where Anson sees his brothers condition and learns from Stef that Kerry betrayed him and brought Yannick the basil (Which Kerry confirms, and further tells him her apparent romantic interest in him was a ruse). While Anson holds his brother as he succumbs to his wounds and anaphylaxis, Kerry frees Bert, a random patron who was being kept hostage in the kitchen by Mimi. Together they head upstairs to escape through an opening for an air conditioner. When Anson suddenly runs out of the kitchen attempts to attack Kerry after Stef dies, she manages to shoot him with arrow. Thinking she is safe Kerry crawls out the opening, only for a revived Anson to appear & take a bite out of her leg; however Kerry still manages to escape. Though the fall from the opening kills Bert, Kerry lives and is riding away on a Vespa when she is hit by an ambulance, whose driver happens to be someone she completed paramedic training with. As she is loaded into the ambulance, Kerry panics and notes that Anson (who had been watching from the opening) has disappeared.  Several months later, we see Anson consulting with his brother (who is now a pickled head impaled on a stick) before heading into the convenience store he went to in the beginning of the movie. He visits with Bethany (the clerk) and gives her a single red rose while proposing a romance between them, which Bethany agrees to. As Bethany and Anson share ice cream & flirt, the camera pulls back to reveal Kerry across the street, scarred but alive, taking photos of them.

And as Smith falls head-over-heels in love with Amy, the girl-next-door, he finds in Amy's father Butch the all-American cowboy he wishes his own father could be. But alas, when Smith goes on a hunting adventure with Butch, Butch injures himself while chasing a doe.  Smith's rescuing Butch makes him a local hero, but also strains his relationship with his father.  With Butch unable to work, his wife decides to move away from the house and takes Amy with her.  Amy, unable to deal with the turmoil in her own family, threatens to run away.  Smith leaves the house on his bike to meet up with her, though Butch arrives soon after and prevents her from doing so.

Furious, they condemn his sister to studying, and upon Smith's return banish him back to India after he declares his love for Amy.  Nineteen years pass in India, with Smith becoming a neurosurgeon and finding a woman to marry.  Smith's wife dies of a complication - though unknown - that Smith himself tries to cure.

The movie concludes with Smith re-affirming his desire to meet Amy and riding out on the same old bike to do so.  
Haal E Kangaal
  Two struggling filmmakers meet after a gap of fifteen years and amidst celebration, enmity and jealousy realise that they are as bankrupt as every before - in all sense of the word.  The film is a [[Black Comedy]] that is a humorous account of the artistic and intellectual bankruptcy of independent film making scene that presently exists in India. In a larger context, the film subtly debates the role of a filmmaker / artist in a highly competitive self centric world.  <blockquote>"Normally a film would have many locations, numerous characters and many dramatic twists in the plot. But 'The Bankrupts' treads an off beat path that is often not traveled by many. The entire film is set in one location inside a flat in a housing society in the city of Mumbai and starred by only two actors.. It is very rarely that we see films that have only two characters set in a single location."(Source: Manglorean.com Site)<ref>[http://www.mangalorean.com/news.php?newstype=broadcast&broadcastid=348392/Manglorean.com Site]</ref></blockquote>  Since the film is on film makers who have studied in film schools, the film was shown to film students in a few film schools, mainly in [[Film and Television Institute of India]], Pune and the Manipal Institute of Communications, before it was finalised.<ref>[http://ramchandrapn.blogspot.in/2014/04/the-bankrupts-haal-e-kangaal-manipal.html/Source: Blog]</ref>

After the Minister of Mining announces his plans to declare contracts with the mining companies unjust and renegotiate the terms, the mining companies hire Terrier's team to assassinate the Minister to ensure their access to the rich mineral resources. Terrier delivers the fatal shot from a [[sniper rifle]] and flees from Africa, leaving Annie behind. After that, Terrier retires from his mercenary career.  Eight years later he returns to DRC as a charity worker to build wells. One day Terrier is brutally assaulted by a local hit squad, but he manages to kill them all. While searching the attackers' bodies, he finds signs that the attack was not random and that he was the target. Scared and suspicious, Terrier flees to London to meet an ex-mercenary colleague, who reveals that Cox, their ex-boss in the Congo assassination, has formed a large international security firm offering its services to major clients, such as [[the Pentagon]]. The firm's head wants to eliminate all of the former members of the assassination squad as revelations of their former activities could hinder the development of the new firm. Now the firm's hit teams chase Terrier around the clock, meanwhile killing his friends and kidnapping Annie.  However, Terrier still keeps highly compromising materials that can reveal Cox's role in the Congo assassination and uses it to lure Cox and his team to a [[Spanish-style bullfighting|bullfight in Spain]], threatening to expose their complicity unless they trade Annie for the evidence. Unknown to them, Terrier makes a deal with Interpol to provide evidence to aid their ongoing investigation. Despite battling [[amyloid plaque|severe head trauma]] suffered from his violent past, Terrier defeats the experienced mercenaries sent to kill him. As he struggles to help Annie escape to safety, Cox discovers them. Terrier is wounded but manages to shoot Cox, who is then gored by a loose bull. Interpol officers arrive and take Terrier into custody, though Agent Barnes promises to do what he can to help Terrier avoid doing more jail time than necessary.  The film ends with Terrier, recovered and released from prison, reuniting with Annie in the DRC.

The story is told by Alex's perspective and shown in flashbacks.  Alex meets Jack ([[Israel Broussard]]), his girlfriend, Carla (Sophie Curtis), Ricky (Chris Petrovski) and Cameron ([[Malcolm Mays]]) at detention after they were caught cheating on a test. They team up to hack into the school and change their failing grades. Jack is hesitant at first, but gives in. Thinking that they've succeeded, they celebrate. Soon after, each one of them becomes blackmailed by an unknown person disguised as "Brittany Taman." Everyone is confused due to the fact that Brittany Taman was a student who committed suicide. Ricky reveals that Jack had something to do with her. The unknown person gives each of them different errands. They, then, proceed to find out who their blackmailer is.  Meanwhile, in present time, Jack is seen at the hospital severely burned. He repeatedly says "Brittany," leaving his parents confused. Reverting into the backstory, they soon discover that the blackmailer is their own science teacher, Faustin. He had witnessed Cameron hacking into the school computer. He threatens them to get him a specific amount of money at any cost or else he would tell the police. The group becomes stressed, not knowing how to get the money. Ricky considers telling the authorities, but his family is forced to move back to Russia. Feeling pressured, Carla considers overdosing on pills.  Alex discovers a way to steal 5 million dollars. They all team up, once again, to steal money using fake ID's and add all the money to the school account online. Once they obtain all the money needed, they meet their teacher and give it to him in exchange for their freedom. Cameron, still enraged by everything their teacher put them through, confronts him, forcing Faustin to pull out a gun to kill Carla and Cameron. Jack is also shot, but is still alive. Laura threatens Alex to never speak of the incident again and to move far away. Meanwhile, she and the principal go on the school account to discover that all the money the kids had stolen is gone.  Alex then receives a message on her phone that all the money has been deposited into her own account. A video message sent to the principal reveals that Brittany faked her death, and that Jack lied to and used her while he was still with Carla. Carla, later, made the whole school turn against Brittany, which caused Brittany to want to commit suicide. Also, Cameron and Ricky wanted to take advantage of her. The video ends with her saying that these haters will pay for everything they did to her. It becomes clear that there is much more to this story than meets the eye. After putting pieces together from Alex's story, Laura learns that Alex is actually Brittany. The attorney also learns that she stole the money and shot her classmates herself. Meanwhile, Jack dies from his severe wounds at the hospital.  Brittany is seen taking out brown eye contacts revealing her natural blue eyes while leaving in a car. That, also, reveals she faked the Alex identity to avenge herself and truly is Brittany. The movie ends with Laura running and yelling after her.

Harbinger Down
 In 1982 a Soviet moon lander crashes into the Bering Sea. In 2015, two biology graduate students, Ronelle and Sadie join their professor, Stephen, on an experimental tour to study the effects of global warming on whales. Sadie's grandfather, Graff, takes them to sea in his commercial fishing trawler, ''Harbinger'', which is crewed by Bowman, Roland, Big G, Dock, Svetlana and Atka. Sadie declines when Graff encourages her to helm the boat as she has lost her nerve since losing her father at sea. After meeting the crew, Sadie, Ronelle and Stephen go to sleep.  That night, Sadie wakes as the crew catch a load of fish. Detecting that there is whale activity in the area, Sadie unsuccessfully attempts to wake the others, then investigates on her own. With sonar equipment she finds something large under the ice. The crew help to recover what proves to be the crashed Soviet lander, now frozen in ice. Ronelle and Stephen are awakened by the commotion and Stephen excitedly claims ownership of the lander. Graff disputes his claim and says the Russians will want their ship back. Sadie points out that the object was the property of the now-nonexistent Soviet Union, therefore maritime salvage law would give them the rights to it. Graff infuriates Stephen further by declaring that it belongs to Sadie. Ronelle tries to contact her sister Tamara to tell her about what they found to no avail.  Bowman encourages Sadie to investigate the moon lander before Stephen can find a way to claim it for himself. Bowman recruits Big G to distract Stephen while Sadie sneaks off. Sadie discovers that the Soviet cosmonaut died of an unknown infection and takes a skin sample to analyze. Stephen becomes further frustrated when he learns she has examined the spacecraft before him. He threatens to destroy her career unless she signs over the discovery to him.  Graff threatens to take the issue to the courts but Sadie gives in. Meanwhile, Sadie learns that the moon lander was carrying [[tardigrades]], a hardy terrestrial life-form that can survive in extreme conditions. However, cosmic radiation has caused them to mutate and become capable of shapeshifting.  When the cosmonaut's body goes missing, Stephen accuses Sadie of moving or hiding it. She denies this and Bowman defends her. When Stephen becomes belligerent, Graff threatens him. While examining the lander, Stephen becomes contaminated with the mutated tardigrades, and the cosmonaut's body kills Roland. Sadie finds Stephen on deck complaining that he can't breathe and sees him stripping his clothes off despite the sub-zero temperatures. The others drag him back in, after which several stalks sprout from his back and spray the area with a strange, dark liquid. Dock is sprayed in his mouth but Sadie confirms that they are all potentially contaminated. They make the liquid nitrogen portable by putting it into a scuba tank and proceed to freeze Stephen's body and the lander.  When Dock begins to show signs of infection Svetlana locks him in a cage above deck in order to incinerate him using a flare gun. The others object to the plan until Dock also sprouts tentacle-like growths. The tardigrades cut the ship's power, demonstrating high intelligence, but the backup battery kicks in. As they work to restore it, the organism kills Atka, during which Svetlana is revealed to be a Russian spy. Holding Sadie, Bowman, Big G, Ronelle and Graff hostage, she explains that the tardigrades were part of a Soviet experiment to create radiation-resistant cosmonauts. She does not want to reclaim the Soviet moon lander but instead intends to sink the boat after being picked up by a nearby Russian submarine. Before she can kill her hostages, however, the organism attacks, causing Svetlana to lose her gun. Ronelle picks up the gun, but is grabbed by the creature and pulled through a small pipe. When Svetlana tries to reason with the others, she too is grabbed by the creature and dragged off.  The survivors Graff, Sadie, Bowman and Big G search for several explosive charges that Svetlana has hidden throughout the boat. The last four are hidden in the [[bilge]], a tight area which only Sadie has access to. As she collects the explosives, the others discover that the tardigrades have consumed and absorbed their latest catch, two tons of crab. As they call down to warn Sadie, she realizes she is standing amid the tardigrades. Although she escapes, Graff is infected. He instructs Big G to restart the boat and Sadie to pilot it before asking Bowman to kill him.  Big G restarts the ship but dies after battling Svetlana's shape-shifted and mutated body. Before Bowman can freeze Graff with the liquid nitrogen, Bowman is impaled by the creature. Graff, fighting the creature, instructs Sadie to scuttle the boat and save herself. She steers it toward an iceberg and escapes just as the creature bursts through the deck. Via the portable radio, the US Coast Guard alerts her that a rescue helicopter is in her vicinity. The helicopter can be heard approaching as Sadie lies motionless on the ice.

The Hallow
  Adam, a British conservationist specializing in plant and fungal life, his wife, Claire, and baby son Finn, travel to a remote Irish village surrounded by a large forest.   Some time later, Adam walks through the forest with baby Finn, surveying the woodland for plans to log the area, and stumbles across an abandoned house with the carcass of an animal that has been burst open from a fungus-like substance. He takes samples of the carcass before heading home. Back at the cabin, Claire, removing metal bars from the windows, watches as a man from the village, Colm, drives up looking for Adam. Claire informs him that Adam is not presently there, and the man leaves angry.  That night, the baby begins to cry, and they hear a crash. Claire runs to the room, but the door mysteriously slams shut. Once the door is opened, they realize the window was smashed and call the police, believing it may be Colm from the village. The police arrive, but believe a bird flew into the window causing the damage. The officer tells both Adam and Claire about the legend of the surrounding forest; the villagers claim it belongs to "The Hallow" and is inhabited by "fairies, banshees and baby stealers." The incident is dropped and the police leave. Adam goes outside to take pictures of the damage and notices odd movement in the woods.   The next day, Adam, with Finn, travels to town with the damaged window to have it repaired and is again warned about the hallow. Claire at the house is frightened by Colm when he comes into her home uninvited, Colm warns Claire to leave the village and leaves behind an old book. On his way home from the village Adam has issues with his car, forcing him off the road and nearly causing him to wreck. He opens the hood to see a vine-like fungus clogging the engine, opening the boot, he is hit and pushed in. After awaking, Adam hears noises outside scratching at the car, with Finn, still in the car, beginning to cry as the car shakes and shadows move menacingly across the windows. Adam kicks a hole in the backseat cushion and pushes his way out just as the car stops shaking. He gets Finn out of the car, which has a number of deep scratches across it. Then, scared and worried, he starts towards home.  At home Claire is frantic for Adam and Finn and is relieved when they arrive. Adam immediately gets a gun and asks Claire to go upstairs and call the police. The lights are cut, and Adam goes downstairs to check the house, only to find it ransacked. Adam, believing it's Colm, becomes angry, and Claire begs him to leave. They pack up and make a run for the car. At the car, Adam and Claire attempt to get it started and clear the fungus - which has grown throughout the engine at an amazing pace - from the vehicle, as the creatures from the forest start to chase after them. They manage to start the car, but the creatures pelt it with a mud-like goo - ostensibly, the fungus - which breaks the glass portions of the car, causing them to crash into a ravine. Unable to go any further, they make a run back to their house.  Back in the house, Adam is stabbed in the eye with a syringe-like appendage while looking through a keyhole outside. It is then discovered that light can keep the creatures at bay. Claire heads to the attic and Adam attempts to get the back-up generator started. The creatures get into the house and go after Finn in the attic, almost reaching Claire before Adam is able to get the generator started. Now with the house in full light, Claire and Adam go about barricading the house with the same bars Claire removed from the windows and pointing lamps at them. To protect Finn, Adam places him in a locked cupboard and points another light directly at it. Adam looks through the book Colm left and reads information on the forest legends. Claire, worried about Finn, opens the cupboard to find a creature kidnapping Finn, and they chase after the creature, but it is able to get away when Adam falls from the attic and is knocked out and left with a broken leg. Claire chases after Finn and finds him in a pond, but is able save him before he drowns. Going back to the house, Adam, now awake, sets his broken leg and helps Claire with Finn. Adam becomes suspicious of Finn, believing he is not actually Finn but a changeling, and that the creatures in the hallow stole Finn and exchanged him with one of their own. Adam and Claire begin to fight, and Claire stabs Adam before running away with Finn.   Adam searches for Claire and Finn but starts to turn into a creature himself, the infection spreading from his eye. Claire defends herself and is able to get away to the forest. Adam tracks Claire into the woods, but hears a baby cry and follows the sound. In a nearby cave, Adam faces the creatures from the hallow. Claire makes it out of the forest to the next house, where Colm resides, and begs to be let in, but Colm, answering the door with a shotgun, tells her of his daughter Cora, who was also taken by the creatures. He tells her to get away from his home before they come, and Claire is forced to run away with Finn. Adam finds the baby in the cave being held by a transformed Cora. Adam understands what the creatures want Finn for, they want him for their family. Claire, in the woods, sees the creatures coming towards her and uses camera flashes to keep them away. As she moves away, Adam is able to find her and brings her the second Finn. Adam keeps the creatures away long enough for Claire to believe him. She grabs the real Finn and runs away while Adam is fatally wounded by another creature. As daylight breaks, Adam sees the changeling Finn lose consciousness peacefully, as if sleeping, before being gruesomely destroyed by the light of the rising sun. Claire, able to make it back to the house, breaks down and cries with the real Finn over her husband's death.   As the credits roll, a logging company is cutting down the forest. The screen pans over to the forest as a truck containing several felled trees rolls up and stops. The fungus is seen on the trees and visibly spreads to several more logs before the screen cuts to black. Suddenly, the hallow appears screaming on the screen before it fades to black.

Shastri is constantly being chased by British soldiers for his weird experiments, but unbeknownst to them, Shastri is secretly building a flying machine. Seeing Shivi's great knowledge of the [[Vedas]], Shastri shares with Shivi a [[Vaimānika Shāstra|secret book of ancient Indian aeronautics]], which he is using to build an aeroplane. Shastri offers to let Shivi be his assistant, but Shivi refuses. Shivi later proposes to Sitara, but Sitara resists on the grounds that society will not accept their marriage. She goes away to Hyderabad.  Heartbroken, Shivi goes back to Shastri and accepts his offer to assist him. Together they work for several months on the flying machine, but they fail again and again. On running out of funds, they ask a local king to sponsor their experiments. Finally, they manage to build a small aeroplane and have a successful unmanned test flight in the presence of eyewitnesses — but it crashes within a few seconds. Shivi later learns that Sitara is back in Bombay, living in poverty and debt. In order to get Sitara out of debt, Shivi sells Shastri's secret book to a British officer.

In his quest to build a perfect flying machine, Shivi goes to [[Banaras]] to meet a guru, to whom Shastri used to refer. The guru gives Shivi a code, "4121", which helps Shivi figure out that [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] will be the best fuel for his engine, since in Hindi the word for "mercury" (पारा) looks like the number 4121. Before Shivi can complete his machine, British officers arrest him on a complaint made by his brother. After being rescued by a freedom fighter, Shivi finally takes the aircraft to the beach. Before the soldiers can arrest him, Shivi flies away with Sitara, thus becoming the first people to ride in a flying machine.  
The Hateful Eight
 Years after the [[American Civil War]], [[bounty hunter]] Major Marquis Warren is transporting three dead [[Bounty (reward)|bounties]] to the town of [[Red Rock (Wyoming)|Red Rock, Wyoming]]. He hitches a ride on a stagecoach driven by O.B. Jackson. Aboard is bounty hunter John Ruth, and handcuffed to him is fugitive Daisy Domergue, whom Ruth is escorting to Red Rock to collect her bounty and watch her hang. Ruth and Warren bond over Warren's personal letter from [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Former [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost-Causer]] militiaman Chris Mannix, who is traveling to Red Rock as the town's new sheriff, persuades Ruth and Warren to let him on the stagecoach. Warren and Ruth form an alliance to protect each other's bounties.  The group seeks refuge from a blizzard at Minnie's Haberdashery, a stagecoach lodge. They are greeted by Bob, a Mexican, who says the owner, Minnie, is away visiting her mother. The other lodgers are Oswaldo Mobray, a hangman; Joe Gage, a quiet cowboy traveling home to visit his mother; and Sanford Smithers, a former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general traveling to put his son to rest. Suspicious, Ruth disarms all but Warren. As the group eats, Mannix surmises that Warren's Lincoln letter is a forgery. Warren admits this, saying the letter buys him leeway with whites, outraging Ruth. Warren leaves a gun next to Smithers and provokes him into reaching for it by telling Smithers he tortured, raped, and killed Smithers' son. When Smithers pulls a gun, Warren shoots him as revenge for Smithers' executions of black soldiers at the [[Battle of Baton Rouge (1862)|Battle of Baton Rouge]].  While everyone is distracted by the confrontation, someone poisons the brewing coffee. Ruth and Jackson drink it, killing Jackson and seriously injuring Ruth. The dying Ruth attacks Daisy, but she kills him with his own gun. Warren disarms Daisy, leaving her shackled to Ruth's corpse, and holds the others at gunpoint. He is joined by Mannix, whom Warren trusts because he nearly drank the poisoned coffee. Warren executes Bob, deducing that he is an impostor who killed the lodge owners, as Minnie hates Mexicans and would never leave one to care for the lodge. When Warren threatens to execute Daisy, Gage admits that he poisoned the coffee. A man hiding in the cellar shoots Warren in the genitals. Mobray draws a concealed gun and shoots Mannix, who returns fire, wounding Mobray.  Hours earlier, Bob, Mobray, Gage, and a fourth man, Daisy's brother Jody, arrive at the lodge. They murder Minnie and five other bystanders, leaving only Smithers. Jody tells Smithers they plan to ambush Ruth to rescue Daisy, and that his gang will spare Smithers if he keeps quiet. The bandits dispose of the bodies, hide the evidence, and conceal guns around the lodge. As Ruth's stagecoach arrives, Jody hides in the cellar.  In the present, Mannix and Warren, both seriously wounded, hold Daisy, Gage, and the dying Mobray at gunpoint. They force Jody out of the cellar by threatening to kill Daisy. Jody surrenders and Warren executes him. Daisy claims fifteen of her brother's men are waiting in Red Rock to kill Mannix and ransack the town; if Mannix kills Warren and allows her to escape, the gang will spare him and let him claim the bounties of the deceased except her brother.  As Daisy and Mobray taunt Warren, Warren shoots them both, mortally wounding Mobray. Gage draws a hidden revolver, but is shot dead by Mannix and Warren. Warren then tries to shoot Daisy, but he is out of bullets. Mannix calls Daisy's bluff and rejects her offer, but faints from blood loss. Daisy hacks off Ruth's handcuffed arm and frees herself. As she reaches for Gage's gun, Mannix regains consciousness, shooting her. Warren persuades Mannix to hang her from the rafters inside the lodge in honour of Ruth. Afterward, as the two men lie dying, Mannix reads aloud Warren's forged Lincoln letter.

The noises awaken Jacob, who then attempts to settle things down. Adrian however rebuffed his concerns and blamed him to be a part of the prank while also, revealing that he overheard a conversation between Steve, Jack and Jacob that Jacob only "likes" Ella to make Megan jealous. The argument ensues into a violent fight which was stopped by an angry Ms. Gonzalez and Ms. Taas. As their punishment, the group was not allowed to attend the remaining activities in the retreat and instead serve detention by cleaning the whole vicinity.   The next night, Ella was haunted by the ghost of Jaime and ended up fainting in fright. Thinking it was another prank pulled by Megan, Ms. Gonzalez and the others made the group stay for another day in the mansion to work out their differences while their classmates and Ms. Taas went home ahead as a huge storm was on its way. Ella then confessed to Adrian that she has the ability to see ghosts and when she was younger, caused her father to be killed, to which she blamed herself for. That night, while Ms. Gonzalez, Father Anthony and the caretakers were asleep, Megan, Jessie, Allison, Jack and Steve decided to hunt ghosts, Jacob, Ella, Adrian and Faye warned them not to but they continued. They decided to leave Megan's cellphone plugged in a battery pack in the confessional in hopes that they will record The Black Lady's (Veronica) voice.   A storm hits the town and causes a power outage the next morning while water begins to flood the mansion. That night, Steve remembered Megan's phone and asked if she has already retrieved it. He goes to get it alone while the others were fixing candles and putting buckets in leaking areas. Father Anthony noticed Allison, Steve and Jack's disappearance and Jessie volunteered to look for them. A chandelier suddenly dropped on the floor and injured Father Anthony's legs rendering him immobile. On the confessional, Steve retrieves Megan's phone and decided to listen if there were voices recorded. He listened to the recording and was frightened when Jaime's ghost appeared pointing at something. He tried to escape but was caught by another violent ghost. His tongue was then severed and he was killed. Jessie found Jack who was revealed to be cheating on her with Allison. Jessie runs away but stumbles into Steve's dead body, which they carry back to the house. They find Megan's phone in his pocket which Mrs. Gonzalez uses to call for help. Faye and Jacob accompanied her. While making the call, Ms. Gonzalez accidentally listened to Veronica's voice recording and Jaime appeared pointing at something. Ms. Gonzalez suffered from an asthma attack and orders Jacob to grab her inhaler. Faye stays with Ms. Gonzalez and decides to listen to the voice recording as well. Jaime appeared once again pointing at something. Suddenly, the ghost who killed Steve appeared and threw Faye and Ms. Gonzalez to a wall injuring them severely. Ella and the others hear their screams and when they ran to help them, they find their corpses with their tongues ripped out. Jacob told everybody that he saw Ms. Gonzalez freaking out over something she heard from the phone. Father Anthony advises them to listen to the recorded message as they might learn something about the killings.   The recording turns out to be Veronica's confession, stating that she committed suicide not because Jaime raped her but that they fell in love. Veronica adds that Amara, a witchcraft practitioner, did not approve of their relationship as she had feelings for Jaime also. Due to her practice of sorcery, Amara influenced everyone to believe that Jaime raped her sister and burn him alive. This led to Veronica committing suicide as she lost the love of her life. Eventually, Amara died too.  Ella then realizes that Amara was the real killer. She also discovers that whoever heard Veronica's confession will be killed by Amara because she did not want anybody to know the truth while Megan concludes that everyone would suffer the same fate. Suddenly Jaime's ghost appeared and pointed at Amara's ghost approaching them. Ella, Adrian and Jacob carries Father Anthony to safety. Megan, Jack, Jessie and Allison flee the mansion. Selya and Anding are then killed by Amara, who blasts them through a glass door. Father Anthony asked the three to leave him behind stating that the Lord is with him no matter what. The surviving trio reluctantly leave him and Amara kills Father Anthony.   Megan and the others cross a flooded area outside the mansion wherein Allison is pulled down by an supernatural force. Jack and Jessie, who noticed her disappearance, are also pulled down and killed before they can warn Megan. Megan now alone encounters Amara surfacing up from the water feasting on the tongues of her three friends. Attempting to get to safety, Megan is captured by the spirit. As the three remaining friends hide, Adrian convinces Ella to use her abilities to ask help from Veronica and Jaime. Ella is drawn to a vision of the afterlife and is greeted by Veronica and Jaime; the former instructing her to destroy Amara's corpse before she takes human form. The trio head to a private tomb in the back area of the house to exhume Amara's corpse. Before Jacob could destroy the corpse, Amara appeared and captured him. A heavily injured Jacob asks Ella and Adrian to leave him before being killed by Amara. While on the run, Adrian is pulled down to the ground by the rotting hands of Amara, also killing him, leaving Ella all alone. She runs to the chapel wherein Amara's ghost confronts her. Using a crucifix, Ella stabs Amara in the mouth and takes out the latter's tongue. Ella is then blasted by the force backwards, injuring her head.  Sometime later, Ella was then seen with her mom and was greeted by her younger siblings. It turned out that Ella suffered from amnesia caused by the head injury as she did not recognize them at all. Ella's mother told her not to worry as her memory will be back some time. Three months later, Ella woke up in her home to find out that her memory has returned. A door opens by itself and Ella, suspecting it was her mother rushes out to tell the good news. However, the spirit of Amara appears once more and the two fight, resulting in Ella getting mortally wounded. As Amara tells Ella that her friends are waiting for her, Ella uses her strength to condemn Amara back to hell by placing a rosary around her neck. As Amara screams and vanishes, Ella collapses unconsciously to the floor. The camera pans up to her as she opens her eyes once more and the screen cuts to black.

Hardcore Henry
   Waking inside a laboratory on an airship, a man recalls bullies from his childhood. A scientist, Estelle ([[Haley Bennett]]), greets him and says his name is Henry, she is his wife, and that he has been revived from an accident that left him amnesiac and mute. After she replaces a missing arm and leg with cybernetic [[prostheses]], [[mercenaries]] led by the [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] Akan ([[Danila Kozlovsky]]) raid the ship, claiming all of Estelle's research is Akan's corporate property. He kills Estelle's scientists before attempting to murder Henry, but Henry and Estelle flee in an escape pod, landing in Moscow. Estelle is abducted by the mercenaries, who try to kill Henry.  Henry is rescued by a mysterious man, Jimmy ([[Sharlto Copley]]), who informs him that his cybernetic implants are running out of power, which will kill him if he can't recharge. Jimmy is killed by corrupt cops bought out by Akan, and Henry is forced to fight his way through both cops and mercenaries, sneaking onto a bus. He is joined by Jimmy — not dead, now an alcoholic, odorous bum — who informs him that one of Akan's associates, Slick Dimitry, has a cybernetic charging pump implanted, which Henry needs to recharge. The two are attacked by a [[flamethrower]]-wielding goon. Jimmy is incinerated, but Henry escapes, locating and chasing Dimitry throughout Moscow before capturing him; just as Dimitry promises him information, he is killed by a sniper. Henry removes the pump and receives a call from Jimmy, who directs Henry to a brothel.  Henry meets two more versions of Jimmy — a cocaine-addicted lothario and a shy, awkward geek — who replace his pump. The brothel is attacked by Akan's forces. Henry fights his way through, but encounters Akan, who taunts him with Estelle's kidnapping, revealing she is being transported by an armored convoy. Akan hurls Henry out of the brothel.  Outside, Henry encounters another Jimmy — now a marijuana-obsessed hippie-biker — who transports him to Akan's convoy. Henry finds Estelle - and Akan, who (seemingly) kills him and buries him in the woods.  Jimmy finds and resuscitates Henry, only to be shelled by a tank. After killing the tank crew, fending off a helicopter, and failing to ride a runaway horse, Henry finds another Jimmy — a gruff sniper in a [[ghillie suit]] — who leads him to an abandoned hotel, where Jimmy is headquartered in a hidden laboratory. Jimmy and Henry encounter a number of policemen surrounding a girl.  They are in the process of forcing her to perform oral sex on one of the cops. Henry kills them all.  Here, the real Jimmy — a quadriplegic scientist — reveals his motive for helping Henry: revenge against Akan, who crippled him after his own cyborg super-soldiers failed. He reveals the other Jimmys are dormant clones that he can control, through which he lives a vice-filled life. The clones attack Henry after Jimmy realizes that Henry has been unknowingly broadcasting his location to Akan, with a strike force closing in. Fending off Jimmy, Henry convinces him to help. Henry and the clones of Jimmy — ranging from a punk rocker to a posh WWII Colonel — fight their way out, killing the force by collapsing the laboratory on them.  Jimmy and Henry drive to Akan's headquarters. They fight their way into an elevator, but Jimmy is mortally wounded. Before dying, Jimmy thanks Henry for being the closest thing to a friend he had, and removes a memory blocker, gradually restoring Henry's memories. Henry fights his way to the highest floor, where he is greeted by Akan, revealing an army of cyborg super-soldiers being fed Henry's memories. One such soldier fights Henry, followed by the rest of the army, chasing Henry to the roof.  Henry wipes out the entire army. Akan arrives and severely wounds Henry. Shortly after, Estelle arrives as well. In reality, Estelle was Akan's wife, forming an elaborate ruse to field-test Henry and use his memories to manipulate cyborg soldiers into doing anything to "rescue" their "wife" — specifically, terrorist attacks and world domination as Akan's loyal slaves. The two leave Henry for dead, leaving in a helicopter. Henry blacks out, but is energized by an emerging memory of his father ([[Tim Roth]]) encouraging him to fight back against the childhood bullies seen in the intro. Henry manages to reach Akan, decapitating him with his cybernetic eyestalk. He jumps onto Estelle's helicopter, presenting her Akan's head. Estelle shoots him, but the bullet ricochets off his cybernetic hand and wounds her, leaving her hanging from the helicopter. Estelle pleads with Henry to save her, but Henry slams the door, sending her falling to her death.  Mid-credits, an answering machine message from Jimmy is heard, telling Henry there is "one more thing" to do.

According to an ancient custom, Mira is placed on a boat deck in her wedding finery to be sent across the water to her future husband, Igor.  As Igor pulls her boat toward him, his people sing an ancient wedding song.  In the middle of the wedding, a dragon captures Mira. She is held prisoner in a cave. There, Mira meets a strange young man who cannot remember his name.  Mira believes him another prisoner and calls him Arman (Matvey Lykov). Soon she discovers that Arman is the dragon who abducted her. He lives in human form, holding back the inner beast, but sometimes turns into a dragon against his will.  As a dragon, Arman is unable to control himself.  Arman shows Mira the island and a place for her to create a home.  He tells her that male dragons had long lived on the island.  As a dragon boy he was allowed to choose whether to stay human or become a dragon. He chose to remain human until a dragon slayer killed his father. In his grief and rage, he becomes a dragon gaining the knowledge of all dragons who came before him. Realizing that dragons were truly monsters, Arman isolates himself on the island to prevent himself from killing humans. Sensing the impending transition to dragon form, he went into the cave where the dragon could not escape and remained there until reverting to human form. He accidentally abducted Mira because of the ritual song sung at the wedding because dragons were believed extinct. The song caught Arman off guard and he did not have time to hide in the cave.  Arman wants to live as a man and crush his inner dragon because he is afraid of harming Mira. Mira talks with Arman and teaches him to live as a human. As they get to know one another, Arman and Mira fall in love although Mira is still afraid of the dragon.

While on the boat, Mira sings the ritual song to call the dragon. Arman hears the song as he is ending his life and changes into the dragon. He recaptures Mira and brings her to the island intending to burn her. Mira does not show fear to the dragon and confesses her love for him. This allows Arman to finally control himself as a dragon.  Years later, Mira and Arman live together on the island with their human daughter. Mira flies on her dragon-husband, he is no longer dangerous to her, and they live happily ever after.

Hell and Back (film)
 At a rundown pier carnival, idealistic promoter Remy ([[Nick Swardson]]) is desperate to bring in business. He is friends with the overweight and odd carnival repairman Augie ([[T.J. Miller]]) and the insolent assistant manager Curt Myers ([[Rob Riggle]]). After Curt discovers that the bank has foreclosed the carnival, a frustrated Remy heads down to the boat of a fortune-teller named Madame Zonar ([[Kerri Kenney-Silver]]), who is in possession of a crying [[Devil]] book. Seeing an opportunity to bring in business, Remy tells his friends that people would come around to see the Devil crying and sets the book up at [[The Gates of Hell]], the park's main ride attraction. When Curt requests a mint Remy has in his possession, Remy forces Curt to take a blood oath so he can pay Remy back with a mint only for Curt to callously admit that he doesn't have a mint. While Remy and Curt argue, Augie sees strange weather and soon, Curt is sucked into [[Hell]] itself through the ride and Remy and Augie take a car from the ride into the portal to rescue Curt.  After landing in Hell, they discover that it is full of green lost souls and aggressive demons. After being discovered, they are taken to the Devil ([[Bob Odenkirk]]) himself, who reveals to be an aggressive, if comical being, who is just coming from a meeting. He encounters the duo and while speaking with them, mentions the Greek legend [[Orpheus]] who has a reputation for bringing mortals out of Hell. He forces the duo to hide while meeting with an [[angel]] from [[Heaven]] named Barb ([[Susan Sarandon]]) with whom he is infatuated. When Barb mentions that she is aware of the mortals in his domain, he tries to show them to her, but discovers that they have escaped and calls out a search for them. Remy and Augie try to use a contraption to escape, but are discovered and are about to be apprehended by demons. Just then, a ship appears and captures them and a demon. On the ship, a mysterious figure disposes of the demon. When the duo tell the figure why they're here, the figure reveals herself to be a female demon named Deema ([[Mila Kunis]]) who Augie becomes infatuated with. She agrees to take them to Curt if they take her to Orpheus. They track him using the Devil's cell phone (which Remy and Augie snagged from his office).  Meanwhile, Curt meets the Devil and hits it off with him pretty swell, but when mentioned that he is being sacrificed for not living up to his blood oath, he persuades the Devil to not sacrifice him via a contract if he puts on a show to win the favor of Barb who had a fling with him while she was dating [[God]]. It was why God sent the Devil to Hell for this. Remy, Augie, and Deema locate the way to Orpheus which is guarded by Deema's mother Durmessa ([[Jennifer Coolidge]]), but they manage to make it past her. Before Deema passes through, Durmessa warns her that Orpheus isn't what she expects him to be. They use a submarine to find Orpheus and eventually locate him when he finds them through a giant robot. They discover that Durmessa was right about him as Orpheus ([[Danny McBride]]) reveals to be an eccentric slacker who is retired from bringing people out of the Underworld. Remy is the only one who seems to enjoy his lifestyle. After passing 2/3 of Orpheus's ridiculous tests, he reveals himself to be Deema's father, as he had a fling with Durmessa, but never came home. Annoyed with Orpheus, Deema leaves and Augie decides to go with her upon being fed up with Remy's selfishness. After sharing a romantic moment, they discover from the Devil's cellphone that Curt is being sacrificed at the crossroads and head out to save him.  When Remy finds out where Curt is via Orpheus's TV, he leaves to find him and uses a [[Purgatory]] boat to catch up with his friends and reconciles with them. The Devil goes back on his deal with Curt and decides to sacrifice him anyway. After the Devil retires to the bathroom after he ate Curt's contract, Remy, Augie, and Deema manage to make it past the Demons guarding Curt and reunite with him. They find themselves at the mercy of the demons and the Devil who decides to sacrifice them all. Having a change of heart, Orpheus attempts to rescue them while disguised as the leader of a demon band, but is also captured. Barb, who the Devil called and showed her the mortals, comes to Hell via a stripper's pole and she becomes attracted to Orpheus because of his song when he disguised himself. A jealous Devil tries to use a bazooka cannon full of T-shirts to kill Orpheus. When they are escaping, a T-shirt hits Barb, knocking her unconscious. While they are falling, Remy slaps Barb awake, but the group find themselves in the lower regions of hell full of living sex-offender trees. One sex-offender tree ([[H. Jon Benjamin]]) had raped Orpheus (which he mentioned multiple times earlier). Orpheus will forgive him if he rapes the Devil, which he does later on.  Remy, Augie, Curt, and Deema are caught and bounded by the trees and when Remy is eventually held down by roots, Curt, while hanging upside down from a tree, drops a mint onto Remy. Although upset at first about Curt keeping this from him, Remy is told that if he eats the mint, the blood oath will be paid. The Devil and a demon try to stop him, but Remy eats it reopening the portal that brought the mortals to hell, sending them back to the land of the living with Deema going with them. When the Devil asks them where Barb is, she eventually appears with Orpheus flying on her, telling him about their relationship, much to his distress. On the surface, the group discovers that Remy's idea to keep the park open is actually successful as people are lining up with coins in their hands to watch the Devil cry.  6 months later, Remy uses the money to renovate the carnival with attractions that are similar to what is seen in Hell, including an attraction called the "Gates of Heaven" with Orpheus and Barb in it.  The ending credits show a lost soul in Hell and a Demon who keeps misleading him (as he does this many times in the film) with the occurrences ending with the demon saying "Welcome to Hell".  
Helios (film)
 South Korea's top most wanted criminal, nicknamed "Helios" ([[Chang Chen]]), and his assistant, nicknamed "Messenger" ([[Janice Man]]), have successfully stolen a mass destruction weapon secretly developed by the South Korean military, the portable nuclear explosive device DC8 along with sixteen raw material spheres. The police forces of Hong Kong, China and South Korea were informed that "Helios" will hold an underground trading in Hong Kong.  An emergency response team was set up in Hong Kong. Its members, chief inspector Eric Lee Yan-ming ([[Nick Cheung]]) of the Counter Terrorism Response Unit, senior Chinese official Song An ([[Wang Xueqi]]), and two South Korean weapon experts Choi Min-ho ([[Ji Jin-hee]]) and Park Woo-cheol ([[Choi Siwon]]), work together to trace the whereabouts of the weapon. Lee also specially invites [[Physics]] professor Siu Chi-yan ([[Jacky Cheung]]) of the [[University of Hong Kong]] to serve as a special adviser for the operation.  Hong Kong, China and South Korea face the same objective, but with different purposes. Choi wants to hunt down "Helios" to take back the weapon to make sure not to divulge secrets of South Korea.

Heist (2015 film)
 Luke Vaughn, a man working in a Southern casino run by "The Pope", has a sick daughter in a hospital. The money he earns is not enough to pay the medical bills. Vaughn must pay for her treatment by Friday and desperately needs $300,000, but Pope refuses his plea for a loan and instead fires him, with his right hand man "Dog" beating up  Vaughn when he objects.  Vaughn is approached by Cox and agrees to rob the money, which the casino is laundering for the mob. After a $3 million heist, the masked thieves are intercepted by Dog's henchmen. A gun battle ensues, wounding one of the thieves. They are forced to hijack a city bus, number 657, after their getaway driver escapes in terror. Police Officer Kris Bajos is parked a half block from the bus stop. Kris hears the gunshots coming from the bus and pursues in her police vehicle.  Pope orders Dog to retrieve the money, resulting in Dog going on a murderous rampage to learn who all the thieves are, killing multiple people. While Pope is unsympathetic to Vaughn's situation, he is alienated from his own daughter, Sydney, so he orders Dog to leave Vaughn's sick daughter alone.  As the thieves commandeer the bus from its driver, Bernie, they take off the masks and Dog's henchmen identify them. As Kris chases the bus, Cox nearly shoots her. The rest of the police cars pursue and post roadblocks. To make Kris negotiate with them, Vaughn writes a passenger's phone number on a bus window. Vaughn warns her that Cox will kill some of the passengers, including the pregnant Pauline, if Kris doesn't order the police to clear the roadblocks. Kris rams the roadblock, allowing the bus to enter the interstate.  The next morning, the wounded thief is dying. Vaughn asks one of the passengers, a veterinarian student, to take care of him. Cox orders Bernie to head to [[Galveston, Texas]]; unfortunately, the bus is running low on fuel, so Vaughn calls for a fuel tanker.  Detective Marconi joins forces with Kris when she is about to be relieved from duty. Marconi monitors the bus via a police helicopter. Cox makes a call to Jono, an old man who aided them in planning the robbery, informing Jono that they have the money and are on the way. While refuelling, Vaughn allows two hostages (Pauline and a young boy) to be released. Kris discovers that Vaughn pulled the robbery because of his ill daughter. Meanwhile, Dog learns the location of Jono through a police radio scanner.  With the wounded thief suffering blood loss, Vaughn calls Marconi to come aboard the bus with a medical kit. He boards and takes a call from Pope, tossing the phone to Vaughn, revealing Marconi's affiliation with Pope. Shortly thereafter, a SWAT team attacks the bus and pops the bus tire, causing it to  crash near a bridge. Most of the passengers receive minor injuries.  With police surrounding the bus, Cox holds Bernie hostage in front of the cops and on live TV. Bernie is presumably shot dead by Cox, but it is revealed that Vaughn shot his partner Cox instead, saving Bernie. Vaughn receives a call from his daughter saying that the money has arrived to pay the hospital bills. Vaughn releases all the hostages and the bus departs once the tires are repaired. The police authorities follow the bus but find out Vaughn has escaped and only Bernie is inside.  Vaughn arrives at Jono's, but finds Dog has killed him. Dog takes Vaughn prisoner by knocking him out with a shot of rock salt from a shotgun and they are joined by Pope and Marconi back on the bus, though Pope soon kills Marconi. Vaughn shows them where the remaining $2.7 million is hidden on the bus, then explains that Pauline was not a pregnant passenger but is actually his sister, who hid the missing $300,000 in her "tummy". Kris had deduced what Pauline was doing and did not stop her from paying the medical bill. Dog is infuriated and is about to burn Vaughn alive, threatening to go after Vaughn's daughter next, when Pope shoots Dog dead. A grateful Vaughn is allowed to get away.

His bag contains memories of years gone by, which hold deep sentimental value to him.   Hector travels south, and tries to track down his sister Lizzie in Newcastle. He eventually finds Derek, her sister’s husband. A furious Derek berates Hector for coming back after so many years. After phoning Hector’s sister to tell her he was in town, Derek drives Hector out of Newcastle, offering him the bus or train station. Derek tries to give Hector money but Hector refuses. He tells Derek he’s heading down to London to spend Christmas with friends in a shelter. He asks if his brother Peter is still in London, and whether he has his number. Derek says no, and warns Hector not to come back.   Hector arrives at a service station and meets up with fellow homeless friends Dougie (who has a dog called Braveheart) and Hazel. Dougie tells Hector to spend the night in the disabled toilet in the services, as it was a cold night and he looked unwell. Hector accepts and when he returns to them the following morning, he finds that Dougie has died. Hazel runs away, leaving Hector to talk to the police. Braveheart is taken to the local dog pound.   Hector arrives in Liverpool and spends the night in a church. The vicar gives him a voucher to take to a backstreet café.

Sara finds Hazel a bed at a woman's shelter and organises transport.   Peter tracks down Hector at the shelter, and tells him he has travelled by bike to numerous shelters in the area to track him down, following a phone call from his sister. They go out for lunch. Peter tries to find out why Hector upped sticks and left his life behind. Peter jokes that Hector has become a ‘rent pensioner’ to make ends meet. Hector says that he was helped by a social worker to get his benefits and pension set up and he lives on that, whilst travelling through the UK. When he sees Sara back at the shelter later, he tells her he never felt out with Peter, but he ‘fell out with life’.   The next day, Hector goes out for a walk but feels unwell and heads back to the shelter. He sees a friend, Jimbo who shows him a page 3 tabloid photo of a young girl. Hector excuses himself and goes upstairs to lie down. Sara goes to check on him and Hector reveals that his wife and daughter were killed on this day many years ago by a drunk driver. This was what caused him to leave his home and live off the grid. He revealed he was sectioned following their death and left his old life behind following a stint in a halfway house.   Hector enjoys his Christmas dinner with friends. Jimbo misses dinner but returns drunk and starts a food fight in the dining room, which earns him an eviction.   Peter returns to the shelter and takes him to a car park, where their sister Lizzie and brother-in-law Derek are waiting. Hector tells Lizzie he blamed himself for his wife’s and daughter’s deaths as they had left after a row. Had the row not happened, they wouldn’t have left their flat and would still be alive. As they are talking, Peter and Derek start fighting, and Hector gets hit whilst trying to intervene.   The shelter starts to empty, and Sara says goodbye to Hector and hopes to see him again next year. He tells Sara that he’s going to stay with his sister for a while, and the plan is to do a family Christmas next year. Sara gives Hector some new footwear, and tells him to look after himself. Hector hitch-hikes back up north, presumably for his operation.

Heneral Luna
 President [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] (Mon Confiado) together with his [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]] [[Apolinario Mabini]] ([[Epi Quizon]]) and the whole presidential cabinet are debating the issue of the American presence in the Philippines. Felipe Buencamino ([[Nonie Buencamino]]) and [[Pedro Paterno]] ([[Leo Martinez]]) support a trade with Americans while  General [[Antonio Luna]] ([[John Arcilla]]) and General [[José Alejandrino]] ([[Alvin Anson]]) want to wage war to gain independence for the Philippines. Luna asks the cabinet to authorize a pre-emptive strike while the Americans have yet to land their ground troops. Aguinaldo however assured his cabinet that the Americans had promised to help win freedom from their Spanish overlords. Unfortunately, the Americans have invaded key cities in [[Metro Manila|Manila]], indicating a possible war against the Filipinos.  Luna and his trusted comrades – General [[José Alejandrino]], Colonel [[Paco Roman|Francisco “Paco” Román]] ([[Joem Bascon]]), Captain Eduardo Rusca ([[Archie Alemania]]), Captain José Bernal ([[Alex Medina]]) and Major Manuel Bernal (Art Acuña) – embark on an arduous campaign against the invading American forces. During an intense battle against American troops led by General [[Arthur MacArthur Jr.]] (Miguel Faustmann) and [[Elwell Stephen Otis|General Elwell Otis]] (E.A. Rocha), Luna asks for reinforcements from the Kawit Battalion but its commander, Captain Pedro Janolino ([[Ketchup Eusebio]]), refuses to comply because the order did not come from President Aguinaldo himself. Luna angrily rides to Janolino's camp, humiliates him in front his men, and dismisses the battalion for insubordination. Luna then assembles an army of 4,000 soldiers by declaring his infamous "Article One", ''stating that all who refuse to follow his orders shall be executed without the benefit of a trial in a military court''. He also recruits Lieutenant García ([[Ronnie Lazaro]]) after seeing his marksmanship skills, and makes him commander of his [[Luna Sharpshooters|elite unit of sharpshooters]].  As the war drags on, Buencamino and Paterno indicate their support of a proposal by the Americans for Philippine autonomy. Enraged by this, Luna orders their arrest. Luna’s campaign is undermined by General [[Tomás Mascardo]] (Lorenz Martinez), who opposes Luna's order for reinforcements, stating that he will only follow the President's direct orders. While the two generals are about to clash in [[Pampanga]], the Americans advance steadily as other Filipino generals like [[Gregorio del Pilar]] ([[Paulo Avelino]]) retreat to the north. Luna visits Aguinaldo and Mabini to file his resignation, knowing that Buencamino and Paterno had been set free. Aguinaldo refuses to accept his resignation, but agrees to let Luna establish a headquarters for the Philippine Army in the north.  Later, Luna is summoned by a telegram to the President’s headquarters in [[Cabanatuan]]. Although his officers are suspicious, Luna rides to Cabanatuan, bringing only Román and Rusca with him. Most of the soldiers had already left headquarters under Aguinaldo's orders, with the exception of some elements of the Kawit Battalion. Luna discovers upon arrival that Aguinaldo had already left and only Buencamino remains in the office. As they exchange heated words, a single shot is fired outside. Luna investigates and encounters Captain Janolino and his men, who attack him. Luna is shot, stabbed, and hacked repeatedly to death. Román is also killed while a wounded Rusca surrenders to the Kawit soldiers. Most of Luna's remaining loyal officers are arrested, while some are killed, including the Bernal brothers.  As ordered by Aguinaldo, Luna and Román are buried with full military honors by the Kawit Battalion - the same men who killed them. Mabini, who is among the mourners, notices a bloodied [[Bolo knife|Bolo]] of one of the soldiers; however, the Kawit Battalion would be exonerated thereafter.  While American newspapers quickly blame Aguinaldo for the death of Luna, after the war an aged Aguinaldo denies his involvement on the assassination; he acknowledges Antonio Luna as his most brilliant and most capable general. MacArthur and Otis acknowledge Luna as a worthy adversary, laughing at the fact that the Filipinos killed the only real general they had.  In the mid-credits scene, General [[Gregorio del Pilar]] makes ready to cover Aguinaldo's retreat to the north. He gathers Luna's remaining men and orders his aide to select 60 of them.

High-Rise (film)
 The film opens with Dr. Robert Laing ([[Tom Hiddleston]]) living in a ravaged [[tower block]], killing a white [[German Shepherd Dog|Alsatian]] and spit roasting it.  The film flashes back to three months ago. The forty storey high-rise tower on the outskirts of [[London]], built by esteemed architect Anthony Royal ([[Jeremy Irons]]), is the epitome of chic, modern living. The wealthy upper echelons of society live on the top floors, while more common families live on the lower ones. The high-rise provides its tenants with a swimming pool, gym, spa, supermarket and even a primary school. There is little reason to leave the building outside of working hours and its occupants gradually become isolated from the outside world.  Laing moves into an apartment on the 25th floor, after his sister dies. He begins a relationship with single mother Charlotte Melville ([[Sienna Miller]]) and becomes a fatherly figure to her son, Toby (Louis Suc). He also becomes friends with documentary filmmaker Richard Wilder ([[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]]) and his heavily pregnant wife Helen ([[Elisabeth Moss]]), who live in a low-level apartment with their children.  Laing works at a school of [[physiology]]. While he is cracking open a [[:wikt:sever|severed]] head, a student named Munrow ([[Augustus Prew]]) faints. Having taken a fall, he is given brain scans as a precaution. The next day, Laing is taken to the 40th storey penthouse to meet Royal, where he finds an opulent rooftop garden and is invited to a party being thrown by Royal's snobby wife, Ann ([[Keeley Hawes]]).  The party turns out to be an 18th-century [[costume party]] and Laing's everyday suit is ridiculed by Ann and other guests, including Munrow, who also lives in the building. Laing is thrown out of the party and becomes trapped in an elevator during a power outage. Such outages are becoming common, along with water being shut off and garbage chutes becoming blocked, much to the annoyance of the lower-floor residents. During a game of squash, Royal tells Laing that these are simply the growing pains of a new building.  Laing receives Munrow's brain scans, which come back clean. However, still angry about his humiliation, the vengeful Laing tells Munrow that they may have "found something", letting him think that he has a brain tumor. Another power outage in the high-rise leads to a night of decadent partying in the hallways and apartments. A drunken and distressed Munrow commits [[suicide]] by jumping off the 39th floor, crashing onto a parked car. Wilder finds it suspicious that no police showed up at the scene to investigate and becomes intent on exposing the injustices of the high-rise.  Law and order begin to disintegrate in the building due to the failing infrastructure and increasing tensions between floors. Violence becomes commonplace, food from the supermarket becomes scarce and the building devolves into class warfare between floors. It is implied that Royal has been bribing authorities to ignore the chaos within the high-rise. Feeling guilty about Munrow's death, Laing shows signs of mental disturbance, eventually barricading himself in his apartment and settling into the chaotic atmosphere, even having sexual intercourse with Helen.  Wilder, waking up from a fight with upper-floor residents, intends to find and kill Royal, believing him to be the cause of what has happened within the high-rise. Acquiring a gun from the Royals' former housekeeper, Wilder also learns that Charlotte is Royal's aide and that Toby is Royal's illegitimate child. Breaking into Charlotte's apartment, Wilder tortures and rapes her for information on Royal. The only resident who still leaves the building for work, upper-floor resident and television newsreader Cosgrove ([[Peter Ferdinando]]), is captured and killed by a gang of lower-floor residents.  Some upper-floor residents ask Laing to [[lobotomy|lobotomize]] Wilder, as they believe he is a dangerous [[agitator]] causing the majority of the chaos in the building. After Laing conducts a [[Mental status examination|psychiatric examination]], he refuses, saying that Wilder is "possibly the sanest man in the building". Laing is nearly thrown off the building to his death for this, but Royal steps in and saves him. Laing and Royal talk about the failure and arguable success of the high rise, that it is a "crucible for change" and could lead to "new developments", as well as giving the residents the opportunity to escape to a new life. The women at the top begin working on a plan to establish new management of the building, and Helen gives birth to her overdue baby. Wilder manages to make his way to the penthouse and shoots Royal dead after a scuffle. He is then killed by Royal's harem of women, as Toby looks on through his kaleidoscope.  The film ends as it began in the ravaged high-rise. Violence has abated somewhat now that many residents are dead, as well as many of the apartments in ruin. Laing appears to have gone insane, speaking about himself and to others in the third person and talking to the building. Laing then lies down with Charlotte, reflecting that what has happened will eventually reach the second tower of the high-rise development. The film ends with Toby listening to a radio broadcast of [[Margaret Thatcher]] saying that where there is state capitalism there can never be political freedom.  
Hey Bro
   
Hidden (2015 film)
  An unknown viral outbreak has devastated the area of the [[United States]]. A family of three, Ray ([[Alexander Skarsgård]]), Claire ([[Andrea Riseborough]]) and their daughter Zoe ([[Emily Alyn Lind]]), have taken refuge in an abandoned fallout shelter shortly after the catastrophe to hide from the monsters outside. Zoe wakes one night after having a nightmare of the 'Breathers'. The family has difficulty coping in their cramped environment but manage by having a set of rules, such as always keeping calm and never leaving the shelter. The three soon discover at dinner that their already dwindling rations are also being consumed by a rat and try to find and kill it. The family also discovers that the rat managed to sneak into the shelter through another opening other than the main barricaded hatch. They find a small air duct but Ray reassures Zoe that the Breathers wouldn't be able to fit through the duct. They believe they may be the only ones left alive. The Breathers have been actively hunting down the family, and have nearly located them multiple times. Claire and Ray's priority is to keep Zoe alive, regardless of what happens to them.  In a flashback, it is the beginning of the outbreak, 301 days ago. After the start of outbreak, Ray, Claire and Zoe drive along a highway fleeing their town, Kingsville, only to be stopped with many other people by the [[Center for Disease Control|CDC]]. Signs all around state that they are under quarantine.  Claire kills the rat but in the process, Ray accidentally knocks over one of their lamps, burning a wooden table. Having put out the fire, the family quickly realizes that the smoke produced from the fire is drifting up the air duct, giving away their position to anyone in the area. Later they discover that the smoke has left ash covered all above their shelter hatch, making their hiding place visible. Claire and Ray go to the surface to cover and hide their shelter but Zoe, using a homemade [[periscope]], spots a humanoid figure in the distance. Disregarding her mother's rules, Zoe climbs through the barricade to the surface to warn her parents of the Breather. She manages to warn them and they all go back into the shelter, but are followed. Claire, Ray and Zoe try to keep quiet but Zoe's doll, Olive, gets caught on a nearby pipe screw and activates, making noises. The Breather attempts to break in. Others join and finally break through the hatch and into the shelter. Claire and Zoe manage to escape through the air duct but Ray is caught and disappears, followed by a spatter of blood. Claire and Zoe run and end up on the highway where they were stopped by the CDC.   In another flashback, two fighter jets fly overhead and bomb the family's town. They rush to a nearby abandoned shelter as the rest of the town's population is decimated by the military. Claire accidentally cuts herself on a rusty piece of iron as she descends into the shelter and notices the flesh around the cut is discolored and her blood black. They deduce that the virus is airborne and they have already been infected.  In the present, on the highway, Claire and Zoe are caught in a net fired from a helicopter. Breathers, actually  American soldiers wearing night vision goggles and re-breather packs, surround them with automatic rifles. The soldiers test Claire and Zoe's blood and interrogate them to find out if there are any others in the vicinity. Afterwards, the soldiers prepare to execute them. Ray suddenly appears and kills one of the soldiers. Ray has black arteries and veins and bloodshot eyes. He incapacitates three more soldiers, demonstrating remarkable physical strength and agility, and is shot multiple times before falling. Claire and Zoe escape from their net, and an enraged Claire transforms like Ray, killing all but one soldier, who injures her. Before he is able to kill Claire, a transformed Zoe appears and exposes the soldier to the air by removing his re-breather, infecting him. Zoe, in her enraged state, almost attacks and kills Claire, but Claire reminds her of their rule to always keep calm. Claire and Zoe sit with Ray during his final moments. Claire notices the helicopter coming back and the two flee.  The two find a sewer system nearby and hide there. They hear someone approaching, who turns out to be Joe, Zoe's friend and next door neighbor. He has survived and leads them to others just like them within the underground sewers. Before Zoe and Claire join the group of infected survivors, Zoe notes how they managed to survive to day 302 while looking at the sun rising through a nearby window. Claire informs her it was not days, implying they are "miracles", something Ray called each day at the beginning of the film. Claire looks up into the window before climbing through the sewer hole, revealing her blood shot eyes.

Hitman: Agent 47
  47 ([[Rupert Friend]]) is an "agent", a [[Genetic engineering|genetically]] [[Human enhancement|enhanced]] [[supersoldier]] created decades ago by Doctor Petr Litvenko ([[Ciarán Hinds]]), a skilled [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] geneticist who had a crisis of conscience and disappeared before the Agent project's completion, leaving behind his daughter Katia ([[Hannah Ware]]). 47 works as a hitman for the ICA (International Contracts Agency) and has spent the last few years tracking down Katia as a means to find her father. His most recent targets were mercenaries led by Delriego ([[Rolf Kanies]]) who have been trying to find Litvenko in order to recreate the agent program for their own means.  Katia, living in [[Berlin]] under the name of Katia Vandix, has worked tirelessly to find her father, and is plagued by overwhelming anxiety and an acute awareness of everything around her, being able to see and hear things well outside a person's normal sensory radius. Katia is approached at a subway station by a man calling himself John Smith ([[Zachary Quinto]]). He tells her that 47 is on his way to kill her, and offers her protection, while alluding that he has information about her father. 47 finds and attacks the pair, who are able to escape, but not before 47 grazes Katia's arm with a sniper bullet. Smith and Katia hide out in a hotel room where the former explains that he is an operative for a corporation known as Syndicate International, and Katia shows him her map of clues to finding her father. Katia asks John to tell her whatever he knows about her father. John responds with Litvenko's age, medical condition ([[rheumatoid arthritis]]) and that he speaks several different languages - including [[Tamil language|Tamil]] which is quite uncommon. He also says that he has stage 3 [[lung cancer]]. With these facts, Katia figures out that her father would be living in a country which has a warm climate where [[Orchidaceae|orchids]] can grow, has Tamil as one of its official languages and where advanced medical treatments are available. Just as she is about to determine the country, 47 bursts through the door, shoots Smith in the chest, and knocks Katia unconscious. Elsewhere, 47's handler Diana ([[Angelababy]]) contacts another Agent with a contract.  Once Katia awakens, 47 explains to her that she too, is an agent, only Katia is more advanced than even 47 himself (he even explains that her real name is "quatre-vingt-dix"; which is [[French language|French]] for "90"). He shows her how to use her heightened senses in combat, as the two fight against Syndicate forces. They are confronted by Smith, who is revealed to have surgically implanted subdermal body armor, making him impervious to gunshots. Despite all these, Katia is not all pleased for being chosen to be a killing machine. Smith demands to know Litvenko's location. After a brief fight, 47 and Katia manage to escape. Katia makes 47 promise that he won't harm her father and finally reveals Litvenko's location: [[Singapore]].  Once there, they find Litvenko, who frequently needs an inhaler to breathe. He apologizes to Katia for abandoning her, saying that he only wanted to keep her safe. He refers to 47 as her "brother", saying that he had left her with family after all. Just then, Syndicate soldiers attack the group and they are forced to flee. During the escape, Litvenko is captured by the Syndicate but not before being slipped an explosive-rigged inhaler by 47.  At Syndicate International headquarters, Smith tortures Litvenko under the supervision of syndicate director Antoine LeClerq ([[Thomas Kretschmann]]). Litvenko still refuses to reopen the Agent program, while exposing LeClerq's plan to not make Agents as assassins, but as soldiers in a war against the ICA. It is also implied that LeClerq and Litvenko knew each other in the past as rivals. While Katia crashes a helicopter into the building, 47 infiltrates the headquarters disguised as a firefighter. The two fight their way through Syndicate security forces, and 47 is once again confronted by Smith. With Smith being impervious to bullets, 47 defeats Smith by electrocuting him. On the rooftop, 47 and Katia fight their way through the last of the Syndicate's security, but not before LeClerq escapes in a helicopter with Litvenko. In mid-air, Litvenko detonates the inhaler given to him by 47, ensuring that the syndicate will not come after Katia. 47 then calls Diana and confirms his first target (LeClerq) has been eliminated. When Diana asks about the second target (implied to be Katia), 47 drops his phone off the side of the building. As the two prepare to leave, they are confronted by Agent 48, an exact look-alike of Agent 47, who tells them "Diana says 'Hello'" before a gun battle begins between them.  A [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]] shows the electrocuted body of Smith, now with white hair and a ghostly pale complexion, as he jolts awake.

Gathering his old crew, he set out to find his body, he found it but the body was heavier than he thought, so he and his crew put some stones on him and removed the chain on his neck containing a message for his wife. Hong-gil after this event climbed the level 16th mountain with his bad legs believing Moo-taek was his legs and the people who died with him were his lungs and heart.

Home (2015 film)
 On the run from their enemy, the so-called planet-destroying Gorg, an alien race known as the Boov find [[Earth]] a suitable place to call "home". Led by Captain Smek ([[Steve Martin]]), they commence their "friendly" invasion of the planet, relocating the humans, whom the Boov deem as simple and backwards, to other parts of the planet while the Boov inhabit their homes in a quick and [[Bloodless war|bloodless conquest]]. One of the Boov, named Oh ([[Jim Parsons]]), is a more excitable, freethinking member of the species, who decides to invite the Boov to his apartment for a housewarming party, despite the race's [[antipathy]] towards him. Not far from Oh is a fourteen year old<ref></ref> girl named Gratuity 'Tip' Tucci ([[Rihanna]]), who drives away through her home city to find her mother Lucy ([[Jennifer Lopez]]) after being separated from her during the invasion, leaving her with only her [[calico cat]] Pig and fueling her hatred for the Boov.  Oh runs into the street to meet up with a Boov cop named Kyle ([[Matt L. Jones|Matt Jones]]), who, like the rest of the Boov, doesn't want to befriend him. Oh invites him to the party but accidentally sends a mass invite to every Boov on Earth. However, the "send all" button he pressed actually sends the invite to absolutely every alien race in the entire universe including the Gorg. Everyone, aggravated with Oh for revealing their location to the enemy, starts chasing him down. Oh runs into a convenience store to hide just as Tip and Pig enter the same store to grab supplies. They come across each other, and after Tip's car fails to start, Oh transforms it into a fantastical, hovering craft named Slushious to continue transportation. Oh hitches a ride with Tip when he promises to help her find Lucy, but unfortunately, they must go to the Boov Command Center in Paris and locate her from there.  After reaching the Boov Command Center, which is in the now-floating Eiffel Tower, Oh manages to get into his account, and deletes the message with just a second to spare before it reaches the Gorg. He then plugs in Tip's brain to help her find Lucy. They eventually trace her location to Australia, where she is also looking for her daughter. The other Boov then find the two and try to "erase" Oh, while Tip grabs the gravity manipulation system and flips it over, causing the whole Tower to tilt upside down.  As Oh and Tip head off to Australia, they see other Boov riding by them in fear, and realize that a Gorg ship is close behind them. Tip and Oh manage to knock it down, but in the process a chunk of it hits them and they lose their slushie fuel, causing the car to crash-land. They come across the fallen Gorg ship and find out that it is actually a drone. Oh recovers a special chip and uses it to get their car up and running.  Tip and Oh make it to Australia and see the Boov evacuating to their mothership. When they land the car, Tip immediately starts looking for her mother, but Oh insists on evacuating with the other Boov instead. Tip gets angry at him for trying to break their promise again, and she declares that he was never truly her friend. Heartbroken, Oh returns to the ship. The Gorg mothership comes close to the Boov ship, but Oh pulls out the Gorg chip and uses it to fly the ship further away from the Gorg. The Boov become astonished at Oh's plan, but Smek becomes upset and reminds everyone that he is the captain. However, after Oh tells the Boov about what he learned from Tip, the Boovs then [[mutiny]] against Smek and Kyle grabs Smek's "Shusher" (a scepter with a rock on top of it, which Smek stole from the Gorg) and gives it to Oh, declaring him the new captain, much to Smek's dismay.  Tip rushes aimlessly around the city to find Lucy, but in vain. Just when all hope seems lost, Oh returns to her side and helps her track down Lucy. The mother and daughter finally reunite and thank Oh. Suddenly, the Gorg mothership descends upon the planet, and Oh realizes that they want the rock on the Shusher, since Smek had previously stolen it from them. Oh runs to the ship to try to attract its attention, locking Tip and Lucy in the car for safety. Tip breaks out of the car and shines a light in the Gorg Commander ([[Brian Stepanek]])'s face to bring his attention to Oh as he holds the rock up. The Gorg Commander  halts the ship as it crunches down on the ground, with Oh directly in its path. Tip rushes to rescue him, but Oh is seemingly crushed beneath the ship until it backs up and reveals him uninjured. The Gorg Commander emerges from his armor to show that he is actually a harmless [[starfish]]-like creature. Oh returns the rock to him, which turns out to be an egg for millions of developing Gorg larvae; the next generation of Gorg, revealing that the Gorg Commander/"Father" had been the [[Endling|last of his kind]], alone and almost [[extinct]]. He thanks Oh and departs.  Two weeks later, the humans have returned to their original homes, and Oh finally gets to have his party at his apartment, with both humans and Boov in attendance. Tip plays her music and gets the rest of the Boov to experience dancing for the first time, while other Boov, including a reformed Smek, party on the moon, and thousands of ships from other planets, including the Gorg, head to Earth for Oh's party upon receiving his invite.

They go home to Melbourne for Christmas and John collapses while decorating the Christmas Tree. John is re-admitted. While exchanging Christmas presents, John confesses to Tim he was close to death and it felt so easy to let go, which deeply upsets Tim.  On 26 January 1992, Father Woods ([[Paul Goddard]]) approaches Tim while at the hospital and tells him he will include Tim during the funeral and refer to him as John's friend so as to not further alienate John's family. Tim angrily tells him that they've been together for 15 years and that John is his "husband." John dies shortly after and the funeral is held with students from Xavier College.

Hong Kong Trilogy: Preschooled Preoccupied Preposterous
 '''Jenny Suen''', the film's producer, spent over a year interviewing over a hundred ordinary people in Hong Kong as part of the casting process. She and Doyle then used those recordings as voice-overs to structure a loose narrative that the people were asked to act on-screen. The result is a visual poem in which Christopher Doyle's images run parallel with their words of the characters as they ponder how to live together and what society should be.  Doyle calls this  style "realidada," a free-flowing narrative form that owes just as much to the absurdity of real life as it does to the cinematic language through which it was interpreted.  In “Preschooled,” "Little Red Cap" tries to resolve the question “Why are there so many gods in this world? Is it because so many people need to be saved?” by evangelising all the world faiths to her schoolmates. “Vodka Wong” releases plastic turtles to redeem the bad karma that resulted from his parents’ neglect of him.  In “Preoccupied,” young people occupy the streets of Central, Hong Kong. They stop the city to think about what they want for their future. Twenty-eight-year-old “Thierry the Feng Shui Master” and her crew of underground rappers and artists give voice to their discontent.  “Lady Swim” and “Mister Li” look “Preposterous” as they go on a speed-dating tour of the city trying to reconcile their new energies and the obligations convention has imposed on them.  The characters of each generation wonder how to live, here and now. At the end of their journey, they find no answers. Yet what they do find is that they are not alone in asking the universal questions that everyone shares: who we are, how we fit in, and what the city wants to become together.

Cooper's name has become a verb synonymous with screw-ups, following incidents such as overreacting when the mayor's son yells "[[riding shotgun#Modern usage|Shotgun!]]", setting him on fire by [[tasing]] him while he carried an alcoholic drink. Her ineptness in the field has her assigned to the evidence locker.  Cooper's commanding officer, Captain Emmett, gives her a secret assignment to join Deputy US Marshal Jackson, protecting Felipe Riva and his wife Daniella. Riva must go to Dallas to testify against notorious cartel leader Vicente Cortez. At the Riva home, a pair of masked assassins and a different pair of Hispanic assassins kill Jackson and Felipe while Cooper and Daniella are upstairs. Daniella grabs one suitcase, containing many pairs of shoes, and the ladies flee in Riva's car. When Daniella later tries to run off, Cooper handcuffs herself to her.  The ladies are found by Cooper's fellow officers Dixon and Hauser. When Cooper notices a tattoo that reveals the officers are one of the assassin teams, they pretend that Daniella is having her [[menstruation|period]] so they can go to the bathroom. They escape and head for Dallas, where Daniella can testify against Cortez.  The ladies learn that Cooper is now labelled a fugitive, fleeing with Daniella. A truck plows into the car, spraying hidden [[cocaine]] everywhere. Cooper gets the truck driver to drop them at a clothing store, where the very stoned Cooper gets them to change their clothing. When the pair of Hispanic assassins show up, the ladies stow away in a trailer hooked to a pickup truck. When the truck stops, Cooper tries to steal it when the owner, Red, reappears with a gun. Daniella escapes, but comes back for Cooper and pretends to be her lesbian lover. She uncomfortably gropes Cooper, briefly distracting Red until he accidentally shoots off his finger. Cooper and Daniella grab the pickup and drive away.  The ladies continue bonding, with Cooper admitting that her rigid and by-the-books nature has made it difficult to find a man. They are surprised to find a man named Randy sleeping in the back of the truck. Randy is a felon with an ankle bracelet due to viciously assaulting his sisters' abusive boyfriends. Cooper agrees to take off the bracelet in return for Randy's help. Daniella is pleased to see Randy flirting with Cooper.  Stopping at a hotel for the night, Cooper cuffs Daniella to the bedpost while she goes to Randy's room for food. She walks in on him naked and eventually succumbs to his charms and kisses him. Cooper goes back to her room to find Daniella aiming Cooper's gun at her, upset that Cooper's notes reveal her doubts that Daniella would be smart enough to properly testify. Daniella explains that her bag of shoes which were thought to be studded with fake diamonds are in fact studded with $4 million in real diamonds, revealing Cortez' [[money laundering]] method. When Dixon and Hauser appear and shoot at the ladies, Randy attacks Hauser, allowing the ladies to run.  They escape on a tour bus, followed by both pairs of assassins, using the bus to bump the dirty cops' car off the road. Daniella knocks out Cooper &ndash; when she comes to, Cooper sees Daniella working with the hispanic assassins. Cortez killed Daniella's brother, she plans to now kill him at his daughter's [[Quinceañera]]. Daniella had arranged for the thugs to simply "kidnap" her so she could get Cortez then start a life on her own. She leaves Cooper to bring in Dixon and Hauser, earning praise from Captain Emmett, who only laughs when she tells him Daniella's murder plan.  Cooper sneaks into the Quinceañera as a man to get close to Daniella. She tries to get her to wear a wire so that they can get Cortez to confess to her brother's murder, but a woman walking into the bathroom mistakes Cooper for a pervert and throws her out. She gets back into the party, running into Emmett and learning that he is working for Cortez. He pulls a gun on her, but Cooper pours alcohol on him and tases him so he catches fire.  Daniella corners Cortez and reveals her intentions to kill him. Cooper arrives and stops Daniella, but when Cortez draws a gun Cooper shoots him dead. Daniella is angry at Cooper for stealing her revenge, until she sees that Cooper took a bullet for her in the arm.  Three months later, Cooper picks Daniella up from prison after an [[obstruction of justice]] conviction. Cooper is no longer a laughingstock and is praised for taking down Cortez. Outside, she presents Daniella with her shoes. They leave together, and Daniella sees that Cooper brought Randy with her.

Honourable Mention
 This film opens with a character called Dr. Das, a professor at Botanical Institute of India, Allahabad. He is standing on the bus stop and missed more than half a dozen buses as it was norm with him. He is a very dedicated researcher but never cares about his promotion and credits even if taken by someone else. He confesses, once before his assistants after hearing that one of the assistants fail to get success just by two marks, that he's never ever been fortunate in his life and missed everything what was in his way just by a narrowest margin possible. Even he could not own his beloved once from the brutal clutch of destiny. Even though, all three research assistants of Dr. Abhijit Das send a paper to the Seattle Conference, U.S.A., fifteen days before when it was planned, after forging Das's signature, but they too could not change their professor's destiny. His paper is considered just an 'honourable mention' there because of the theory that they propounded has already been anticipated by German scientists. Nonetheless, this film gives an optimistic note at the end when they were safeguarded by the fate itself, when a bus meets with an accident on the bridge that professor denied getting in.  
Hotel Transylvania 2
 Seven years after [[Hotel Transylvania|the first film]],<ref name=InquirerFacts /> Mavis and her new fiancé Johnny are finally married, with the approval of her father [[Dracula]], and the world becomes aware of (and unfazed by) the existence of monsters. A year later, Mavis reveals to Dracula that she is [[pregnancy|pregnant]] and gives birth to a baby boy named Dennis, who later befriends Wayne the Werewolf's daughter Winnie. Nearing his fifth birthday, Dennis has yet to grow his fangs and Dracula worries that his grandson might not gain vampire powers. Noticing the dangers of Transylvania, Mavis starts to consider raising Dennis in California where Johnny grew up, much to Dracula's disapproval.  Dracula tells Johnny, who also opposes leaving, to take Mavis to California to visit his parents, Mike and Linda, but to make sure to keep her distracted so that she will not move, leaving Dracula to "babysit" Dennis. Believing Dennis is a "late fanger", Dracula enlists his friends Frank, Wayne, Griffin the Invisible Man, Murray the Mummy, and Blobby the Blob to help train Dennis to become a monster, to no avail.  Dracula takes Dennis to his childhood summer camp, Camp Winnepacaca, where he learned to hone his vampire abilities and discovers that the camp is safer than it was when he went there. Dracula hurls Dennis from a tall, unstable tower to pressure the boy's transformation into a bat, but he does not transform, and Dracula has to fly and rescue him at the last second. The stunt is filmed by the campers and uploaded to the Internet, which eventually reaches Mavis and Johnny.  Mavis angrily transforms into a bat to fly her and Johnny back to Transylvania. Dracula and his friends reach the hotel a couple of seconds after Mavis. She confronts her father for putting Dennis in grave danger and his inability to accept that he is human, and states she will move out of the hotel after Dennis' fifth birthday the following Wednesday.  Mavis invites Vlad, her grandfather and Dracula's father, to Dennis' birthday party, in hopes that Dennis will meet him. As Vlad is much worse than he was when it comes to humans, Dracula tells Johnny to have the human party-goers disguise themselves as monsters. Vlad receives the invitation and arrives with his monstrous bat-like servant Bela. Meeting Dennis, he believes that fear will cause Dennis' fangs to sprout and possesses a stage performer dressed as Dennis's favorite television monster, "Kakie the Cake Monster", to scare Dennis, but Dracula shields his grandson at the last moment and exposes the deception to Vlad, who is outraged that Dracula has accepted humans as guests in his hotel, forcing Dracula to confront Vlad.  While the family argues, Dennis sadly flees the hotel and enters the forest with Winnie in tow, hiding in her treehouse. They are attacked by Bela, who mistakes Dennis for a human. When Bela injures Winnie and threatens to destroy the hotel, Dennis' anger causes him to instantly grow his fangs and his vampire abilities manifest. He begins to fight Bela, who calls his giant-bat minions. Dracula, Mavis, Dennis, Johnny, the rest of the monsters, and Johnny's family team up to defeat Bela's allies. A livid Bela then attempts to kill Johnny himself with a stake. Having been won over by Dracula's claim that humans are harmless now, Vlad shrinks Bela and tells him never to bother his family again.  With Dennis having vampire abilities, Mavis and Johnny continue to raise him in Transylvania, and they resume the party with his friends.  
The House on Pine Street
  
The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence)
  William "Bill" Boss ([[Dieter Laser]]), a [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]] prison warden, watches the end of ''[[The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)]]'' with his accountant, Dwight Butler ([[Laurence R. Harvey]]). Bill says that he hates the films as his feet are massaged by his assistant, Daisy ([[Bree Olson]]). Daisy replies that she enjoyed them. In response, Bill sucks his finger and [[Fingering (sexual act)|inserts it]] into Daisy's vagina, telling her that women should not be allowed to voice their opinions. Dwight interrupts, attempting to pitch a "brilliant idea" to fix the prison's horrible retention and violence rates, but he is interrupted by a phone call.  Bill and Dwight are then summoned to the scene of an assault within the prison. One of the officers has been stabbed by an inmate. As punishment, Bill decides to stomp on the arm of the prisoner ([[Tommy 'Tiny' Lister]]), exposing the bone and causing immense pain. He promises to do it again when his bones are healed.  Back in the Warden's office, Bill receives a mysterious package. After Dwight asks what it contains, Bill reveals that it is a jar of specially imported, dried African [[clitoris]]es which he eats "for strength." After eating a few, he receives a threatening prank phone call from one of the inmates ([[Jay Tavare]]). Bill [[Waterboarding|waterboards]] him with three buckets of boiling water, horribly disfiguring him. The inmate tells Bill that he has lost his soul.   Governor Hughes ([[Eric Roberts]]) arrives immediately afterwards, ordering Bill and Dwight to put a stop to the violence and promising that they will both be fired otherwise. In anger and retaliation, Bill orders a 'mass [[castration]]' of the inmates, and castrates one of the prisoners ([[Robert LaSardo]]) himself. He covers his face in the blood of the inmate and later eats the cooked testicles for lunch, calling it "Energy Food." Daisy is forced to perform [[fellatio]] on Bill while Dwight is in the room. Upon completing the act, Daisy eats one of the dried clitorises, mistaking them for candy.  Finally, Dwight is able to pitch his idea to Bill. He suggests that all of the prisoners are sutured together mouth-to-anus, forming a giant human prison centipede, claiming that it will be the ultimate deterrent for anyone considering a life of crime. Initially, Bill is opposed to the idea and dismisses it as impossible. However, Bill then has a nightmare about being attacked by the inmates, expressing weakness, and being raped in the kidney by the inmate he castrated. He then becomes visibly more desperate for a means of protection from his inmates.  When the director himself, [[Tom Six]], is summoned to the prison, Bill warms up to Dwight's idea after being assured that it is "100% medically accurate." Six gives the prison permission to use his Centipede idea, provided that he is permitted to witness the operation.  The first two films are then screened in the prison canteen, showing the prisoners what is about to happen to them. A riot breaks out, and several guards are injured. Bill and Dwight flee to the Warden's office as they are being chased by prisoners. Prisoners eventually make it to the office, where one inmate beats Daisy into a coma as another masturbates to the sight. Bill jumps out of the window just as backup arrives and manages to herd the prisoners back to their cells.  Bill then goes around each cell and shoots every inmate with tranquilizers, readying them for the operation. It transpires that some inmates are not compatible for the centipede; one inmate has a [[Stoma (medicine)|stoma]], and another is disabled, so Bill kills them both, by placing his gun inside the inmate's stoma and shooting him, and then shooting the disabled inmate in the head. They also discover an inmate with [[Crohn's disease]], who has constant diarrhea. Bill orders the castrated man who raped him in a dream to be attached to him as an added punishment. Bill and Dwight go and visit Daisy, who is now in a coma. Dwight reveals that he loves her as Bill rapes her motionless body, despite Dwight's protests.  Tom Six returns to the prison, where he is met by Bill and Dwight. Touring the cells, the trio discover a mentally unstable inmate who is [[Coprophagia|eating his own feces]] and wants to be sewn into the centipede. Not wanting anyone to enjoy the centipede punishment, Bill shoots and kills the inmate. Bill and Dwight observe the operation with Six, who vomits after seeing the death row inmates being dismembered for a "special project."  With the five-hundred person centipede now complete, Governor Hughes arrives and is disgusted at what he sees. Not only has a Human Centipede been created, but a 'Human Caterpillar' has also been created out of the inmates serving life sentences. This is the same as a Human Centipede, only the limbs of the victims have been removed, meaning they cannot move. It is revealed that Daisy has also been accidentally sewn into the Centipede. Hughes concludes that Dwight and Bill are insane and should receive the death penalty before leaving the prison in abhorrence.  Bill murders Dr. Jones ([[Clayton Rohner]]), and then Hughes returns to prison with a sudden change of heart, stating that the Centipede punishment is "exactly what America needs."   The film ends with Dwight and Bill celebrating their success. Dwight is then shot and killed for trying to take credit for the idea, even though it was his idea to begin with.  
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2
    [[Katniss Everdeen]] is recovering after being attacked by [[Peeta Mellark]], who has been brainwashed by the Capitol.  Despite her intention to kill [[President Snow]], Katniss is declined that request by [[Alma Coin|President Coin]] - as she is too valuable to risk losing. Instead Katniss volunteers to be sent to District 2, the final district under Capitol control. District 13’s air force launches a full-scale bombing on a mountain nicknamed The Nut, which houses the Capitol’s main weaponry and air force, with few survivors. Although Katniss manages to convince the district to join the rebellion, she is shot by one of the survivors, who is immediately fatally shot by Boggs; Katniss survives the gunshot wound due to her bulletproof Mockingjay suit.  At the wedding of [[Finnick Odair]] and [[Annie Cresta]], Katniss is convinced by [[Johanna Mason]] to sneak aboard a supply craft leaving for the Capitol. Unable to bring her back, Coin has her assigned to the “Star Squad”, which is led by Boggs and includes [[Gale Hawthorne|Gale]], Finnick, Cressida, Messalla, Castor, Pollux, Leegs 1 and 2, Mitchell, and Homes. They will follow in relative safety behind the actual invasion of the Capitol, providing video of their incursion for propaganda purposes. Boggs carries a holographic map (the “Holo”) to help them evade known [[booby trap|booby-trapped]] “pods” which line the streets of the Capitol. Coin also sends Peeta to join the squad, even though he has not fully recovered from the Capitol’s conditioning.  As they venture deeper into the Capitol, Boggs accidentally triggers a land mine and is fatally wounded, giving the Holo to Katniss before dying. The squad triggers another pod which releases a flood of lethal black tar. Peeta momentarily succumbs to his conditioning and attacks Katniss, killing Mitchell in the process. The group takes shelter in an abandoned building, where Jackson, the second-in-command, attempts to commandeer the Holo, until Katniss says that she is under secret orders from Coin to kill Snow. Katniss and most of the group escape just before a squad of Peacekeepers arrive and destroy the building, killing the Leeg twins after they had earlier stayed behind. The Capitol then broadcasts a message with [[Caesar Flickerman]] reporting Katniss’s death and Snow denouncing the rebellion, which is interrupted by Coin, who delivers an impassioned eulogy for her to rally the rebels.  Castor decides to have them go through the sewers to avoid being detected by Capitol forces, having Pollux show the way down. While entering the sewers, Capitol officials witness the intrusion by [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]]; upon discovering this, Snow orders a set of genetically engineered creatures called "mutts" to ambush the group. Jackson, Castor, and Homes are killed as the squad flees through the sewers. Finnick fights off the mutts with his trident and pocket-knife to allow the rest of the team to escape, but they overwhelm him. Katniss set the Holo’s self-destruct, killing the remaining mutts and Finnick to give him a merciful death. While running from pursuing Peacekeepers, Messalla is vaporized by a pod. The surviving team members reach the surface and take refuge in a shop, where Tigris, a former Hunger Games stylist and rebel sympathizer, hides them in her basement.  As rebel forces gain ground, Snow invites fleeing Capitol citizens into his mansion in the city's center for protection, in the process forming a human shield. Katniss and Gale join the crowd, posing as refugees. As rebels arrive and attack, Gale is captured. Peacekeepers herd Capitol children toward the palace gates, when a hovercraft with a Capitol insignia flies overhead and drops small parachutes. As people reach for the parcels, they explode, causing mass casualties. A team of rebel medics, including Katniss’s sister Prim, attempt to help the injured. As Katniss rushes forward, a second wave of bombs detonate, killing Prim and knocking Katniss unconscious.  Upon recovering, Katniss learns the Capitol has been conquered and that Snow is captured. Katniss confronts Snow in his greenhouse. He explains to her that Coin ordered the airstrikes on the mansion using Capitol aircraft, making it seem that Snow would kill Capitol children to delay his own capture, and eroding the last defenses for his regime. When Katniss accuses him of lying, Snow reminds her of their promise before the Quarter Quell to be honest with each other. She then realizes the attack matches a strategy Gale had developed earlier--bombing an area once, and then again with a delayed explosion to kill medics and survivors. When Gale cannot assure Katniss that the bombing was not of his design, Katniss abandons him in shock. Coin invites the surviving Hunger Games victors to a meeting, where she declares herself the interim President of Panem and tables a vote to hold a last Hunger Games using the Capitol's children as a symbolic gesture to avenge for atrocities against the districts. Peeta, Beetee and Annie denounce the idea, while Johanna and Enobaria side with President Coin. Katniss votes yes in exchange for the right to execute Snow for Prim’s death, having realized that Snow was telling the truth about Coin. [[Haymitch Abernathy|Haymitch]] sides with Katniss, figuring that she has good reasons for the barter.  At the execution, Katniss kills Coin instead of Snow by changing her aim at the last moment. A riot ensues. After Peeta stops her from committing suicide via pills, Katniss is arrested while witnessing Snow being beaten to death. While in captivity, Katniss receives a letter from [[Plutarch Heavensbee|Plutarch]] and is assured that she will eventually be pardoned, and will be able to return to District 12 once the dissension quiets. In District 12 she is joined by Peeta, who has recovered from his condition. Commander Paylor is elected the new President of Panem, and Katniss, Peeta, and Haymitch bond over their shared trauma.  In the epilogue years later, Katniss and Peeta play with their two children, and Katniss realizes she made the right choice when she tells her infant that "there are much worse games to play."  
Hundred Regiments Offensive (film)
 The story is based on [[Hundred Regiments Offensive]], a series of engagements involving CPC's [[Eighth Route Army]] under [[Peng Dehuai]] and both [[ Japanese Imperial Army|IJA]] and collaborationist Wang Jingwei forces under [[Hayao Tada]]. In [[Yan'an]], [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Zhu De]] talks about setbacks suffered by NRA in Japanese attacks. In the IJA HQ in [[Peking]], before beginning their advances against Soviet Union and Pacific Islands, the Chinese war must be finished first. Then the commanders are debriefed into Peng and Zuo's profiles then [[Yukio Kasahara]] enforce the [[Three Alls]] upon arriving on the train station. In Peng's position, Zuo told him that the Japanese are controlling the railways, building strongholds and relying on armor to ensnare them. He decided to act. The tactic was distributed to officers and Mao got the message through Zhu De.  In the [[Battle of Zaoyi]] where NRA forces was one-sidedly slaughtered by advancing IJA, Yao Shangwu was dragged away from [[Zhang Zizhong]], and the latter was killed. He was buried in full honors for his effort. He returned home, to find his village ravaged by Japanese Army's assault, massacring all except a mute villager, and his wife and baby killed. He was found by Liang Shan and her unit, when they go to the village. He joined the unit afterwards.  Meanwhile, in Wuxing Eighth Route Army HQ, Peng formulated an offensive with [[Zuo Quan]] to counter the Japanese attempts to ensnare them. He formed 22 Regiments worth, with more joining his plan, involving paralyzing 4 Japanese-controlled rail stations, bridges, mines and factories and forcing the enemies to act. He met Shangwu and Liang's unit to congratulate, revealing that Yao was graduated to [[Whampoa Academy]] and part of Zhang's army and accepts the mute guy's horse. The campaign started by derailing, assaults upon Japanese bases and outposts.  Initially, Shangwu's unit disrupt a train line and assaulted the depot in Niangziguan, suffering and inflicting casualties, but they were fooled by IJA into not touching a fake [[Red Cross]] train, the train dismounted Japanese troops and an [[armored train]] disrupts their attack, leading them to collide a train engine. The unit suffered casualties just to hold a rail switch. They are victorious in the effort. The unit was permanently honored.  In the IJA's headquarters, [[Hayao Tada]] berated Commander Okazaki for his failure and took away his medal. Meanwhile, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was listening to the broadcast in his house when [[Lin Sen]] talk to him about the history of anti-Japanese resistance of China. Mao also listens to the broadcast. Chiang later sends a commendation on the 8th Route Army.  Later, Tada commands a Collaborator to Okazaki to infiltrate the CPC's depot headed by Master Feng and returns his medal. Yao's unit was charged of defending the same depot which develops a new weapon made of chili. They also sent spies upon a Japanese armory depot in Xiyingwu, disguised as supplying Collaborrators. Peng also inspects several volunteers preparing clothes and explains to Zuo the importance of the offensive when 120th Division gives them telegrams. Yao's unit was charged of attacking the depot in Xiyingwu and the division was led by Zuo himself, but there are Japanese armor that serves as reinforcements and civilians as [[comfort women]] inside the depot. Another unit ambushed the armor convoy while Zuo's unit assaulted the depot. When the women were rescued, at the cost of Liu Zhu Zi, whose family hated him for being a 'traitor' and demoted from being a commander to an infantryman, they relentlessly killed all the Japanese soldiers they find. Mao took the telegram on its success. The mute man gave Peng shoes, but he gives it back.  Okazaki meanwhile assaulted the Huangyadong depot in Licheng with infantry and later, air support, but retreated when the news of the counterattack of the 8th was reached him. Master Feng, as well as the Collaborator died on the assault. Peng later honors the casualties and swears revenge upon Guanjianao, a major IJA stronghold and Okazaki's HQ.  Peng himself led the attack upon Panlong, Guanjianao. Casualties were rising on both sides, especially on the caves where Japanese are holed. With air support from Tada, Okazaki led the defense, Kuromon's cavalry was repulsed. The flanks were taking fire, until a squadron entered and eliminated the defenders on a side. The assault on the main peak started. Okazaki relays a message on Tada instead of Kasahara that air support must be directed to him and wears the medal he has. Liang's position was taken air strikes, but unharmed. They were charged to plant explosives under the main base. The mute man sacrificed himself while delaying the cavalry charge, Peng took the bloodied shoes. Yao was hit by airstrike, but unharmed while Liang's men are busy planting explosives. She saved Yao from an exploding bomb, knocked her unconscious. A soldier sacrificed his life while repairing the detonation cord and detonated, destroying the flanks, while Yao carries Liang to safety.  The battle ends in Peng's victory, taking the mountains. months later, Peng and Zuo debriefs his men when Yao approches Peng and told him that if not for Liang (she died of wounds), and Peng's words, he will not be encouraged. Peng told him that it's not him, but Yao's sacrifice made him. Mao made a speech praising Hundred Regiment Offensives and commanded the listeners to use this as inspiration. Near the end of the film, both CPC and NRA are mounting offensives all over China, Zuo Quan was killed in one engagement, until Japan surrenders on 1945. At Zuo's grave, he swore that until the war is over, he will not stop fighting. He completes his map, while Hayao messed his and cried.

Howl (2015 film)
 Down-on-his-luck Alpha Trax [[Conductor (rail)|train guard]] Joe Griffin ([[Ed Speleers]]) arrives at Waterloo Station in time to start his shift on one of the [[Caledonian Sleeper|overnight]] passenger train, which is scheduled to depart London at midnight under a full moon.  A group of passengers is introduced, consisting of Kate ([[Shauna Macdonald]]), Adrian ([[Elliot Cowan]]), Matthew (Amit Shah), Billy (Sam Gittens), Nina ([[Rosie Day]]), Paul ([[Calvin Dean]]) and Ged ([[Duncan Preston]]) and his wife Jenny ([[Ania Marson]]). While he checks the passengers for tickets, he meets his unrequited love, the tea-trolley girl, Ellen ([[Holly Weston]]), who consoles him for being turned down for a promotion. An hour after departure, the train is travelling through a remote and forested part of the English countryside, in a [[Mobile phone signal#Dead zones|mobile communication "dead zone"]]. Here the train is forced to undergo an [[Emergency brake (train)|emergency brake]] to prevent a derailment when a deer runs onto the track.  The train driver Tony ([[Sean Pertwee]]) goes outside to remove the body of the deer from the undercarriage. Whilst outside, Tony gets the deer's blood on him, and is suddenly eviscerated by a humanoid creature with phosphoric yellow eyes.  Meanwhile, the passengers inside the stranded Alpha Trax are all initially strangers, from different walks of British life, are passively-aggressive towards each other, and demand that Joe get the train moving. The already strained situation is deepened when the train's fuel lines are severed and the radio antenna gets destroyed in a series of attacks, and subsequently the passengers are cut off from the rest of the world. After Joe discovers that Tony is missing, he tries to convince everyone to remain calm, but Adrian convinces everyone that the best choice is to disembark and walk towards the nearest station. Joe leads the group away from the train, but soon discovers the disemboweled body of Tony. They all immediately rush back into the train as the howls begin. Jenny is bitten by the werewolf as they try to drag her into the safety of the train. The group scramble to help Jenny, then sit around debating what it could have been that attacked and wounded Jenny.  Kate goes to check on Nina when the werewolf attempts to get in through the door.  Suddenly Nina's phone begins to ring, and just as she answers it the werewolf smashes through a window, grabbing her and dragging her through much to Kate's horror as Nina is heard screaming from the roof of the train and blood begins to pour down a window.  Ged recalls a similar event happening in exactly the same spot - the Great Thornton Forest Rail Crash of 1963 - whereby all the passengers were found disemboweled and partially eaten the following morning. He motivates the remaining passengers to reinforce all the windows in the cabin to help prevent further break-ins by the werewolves. Paul is killed by the werewolf when it manages to break into the train, however it is killed by all of the other passengers fighting together. However, its deathcries manage to alert the rest of its nearby pack, who are now also drawn to the train. Billy offers to help repair the train, and is accompanied by Matthew to act as a lookout. However, Matthew is distracted by calls for help, and wanders into the forest, only to be confronted and killed by three werewolves just when he discovers the half eaten body of Nina up in a tree.  Billy manages to repair the train enough so that Joe can start the train. However, with the werewolves circling the train, Billy hides by pulling himself up into the undercarriage as the train starts moving. Kate is thrown out of the train by Adrian and killed by the werewolves. While trying to hold on, Billy accidentally pulls on the fuel line, which disables the train again.  Meanwhile, Jenny has transformed into a werewolf, kills Ged, and is about to attack Adrian when she is killed by Joe. As the other werewolves board the train, Adrian jumps off, leaving Joe and Ellen to fend for themselves. Billy arrives to help fend off the werewolves, but is eaten as Joe and Ellen escape into the forest. With the werewolves in pursuit, Joe decides to tell Ellen to keep running while he stands his ground to fight the werewolves. Joe is overwhelmed by the werewolves while Ellen makes it to the safety of the nearest station.  The final scene shows Adrian wandering through the forest, and encountering Joe, who has now fully transformed into a werewolf. Joe then attacks Adrian off screen and presumably eats him.

I (film)
 Lingesan ([[Vikram (actor)|Vikram]]) is a [[bodybuilder]] from [[Chennai]], whose main ambition is to become [[Mr India World|Mr. India]]. He wins the title of Mr. [[Tamil Nadu]], which gives him direct entry to the Mr. India pageant. He is [[infatuation|infatuated]] by Diya ([[Amy Jackson]]), a leading supermodel. Diya is soon blacklisted, with all her advertisement film contracts cancelled by John ([[Upen Patel]]), her co-star in all her advertisements, after she constantly rejected his advances. To save her career, Diya decides to replace John with Lingesan, whom she had earlier met at one of her shoots, as her co-star for her next advertisement. The shooting is to take place in China at the same time when the Mr. India paegant is to take place, but Lingesan agrees, sacrificing his Mr. India ambitions in the process.  Lingesan is given a makeover by Diya's stylist, a [[transgender]] woman Osma Jasmine (Ojas Rajani). The shoot initially does not go well as Lingesan is shy and awkward around Diya. On her director's advice, Diya pretends to fall in love with Lingesan so that he would loosen up and perform better during the shoot.The plan proves successful but Diya soon tells Lingesan the truth. Hurt he focouses on modelling instead of her. They both gradually excel in the modelling industry as the lead pair. As time passes, Diya reciprocates Lingesan's love for her and they soon get engaged.  In his journey from a bodybuilder to a top model, Lingesan makes many enemies, including John, whose modelling career was ruined due to Lingesan's rising popularity, forcing him to appear in local advertisements to stay afloat; Osma, who was [[infatuation|infatuated]] with Lingesan and proposed to him, only to be rejected; industrialist Indrakumar ([[Ramkumar Ganesan]]), whose company suffered losses when Lingesan refused to endorse their soft drink as it was reported to contain pesticides; and another bodybuilder Ravi (M. Kamaraj), who also competed for the Mr. Tamil Nadu title but lost to Lingesan. These four people conspire to take revenge on Lingesan and destroy his fame and modelling career.  Two days before his wedding, Lingesan slowly starts to experience hair and teeth loss and a skin disorder. He consults his friend Vasudevan ([[Suresh Gopi]]), a doctor who is also the guardian of Diya's family. Vasudevan claims that he is suffering from a rare and incurable genetic disease which results in premature ageing. Lingesan's condition worsens, with his face and body [[Deformity|deforming]], and eventually he becomes a [[kyphosis|hunchback]]. In his current condition, Lingesan decides to disappear from public eye and also from Diya's life by [[Faked death|faking his death]] in a car accident. Only his friend Babu ([[N. Santhanam|Santhanam]]) and Vasudevan know that he is alive. Lingesan asks Vasudevan to marry Diya as he is the only person who will be able to understand Diya's past and present situation. Vasudevan agrees and the wedding is fixed.  On the eve of Diya's wedding, another doctor reveals to Lingesan that, contrary to Vasudevan's claims, he is actually suffering from H4N2 influenza, caused by the "[[Orthomyxoviridae|I]]" virus, which can only be transmitted by injection. He discovers that John, Osma, Indrakumar, Ravi and, to his horror, even Vasudevan, are responsible for injecting the virus into his body. Vasudevan had an [[Pedophilia|insatiable lust]] for Diya since she was ten years old and was enraged when she chose Lingesan over him. Therefore, he sided with Lingesan's enemies and planned the entire operation to have Lingesan injected with the virus. Enraged and betrayed, Lingesan abducts Diya on her wedding day and keeps her safely in an old house without revealing his identity to her.  Aided by Babu, Lingesan starts taking revenge on those who had deformed him. He first immolates Ravi, who suffers severe [[burn]]s. He then prepares a paste which Osma applies on her body, causing her body to [[Hypertrichosis|sprout huge growths of hair]]. Next, he subjects Indrakumar to [[bee sting]]s all over his body. He fights John over a moving train and gets him [[electrocution|electrocuted]]. Finally, he gets Vasudevan to unwittingly inject a virus into himself, causing his whole body to [[Elephantiasis|swell up]]. After achieving his revenge, Lingesan reveals his condition to Diya, who, though initially taken aback, still loves him despite his deformity. They decide to live a secluded life together. Lingesan undergoes [[Ayurveda|ayurvedic]] treatment, yoga and physiotherapy for his condition and soon returns to normal.  
Hunterrr
 Mandar Ponkshe ([[Gulshan Devaiah]]), is an atypical youth, a sex addict and a player. In his early 30s, he is only interested in 'scoring' one night stands while his friends are all married with kids. The movie opens with one such scene where his friends tell him to get married as he is too old to screw around. In turn, Mandar explains his philosophy about sex as a purely physical act, somewhat akin to the satisfaction of the 'perfect' bowel movement. 'Its a physical need' he philosophizes, whereas love is a different ball game and isn't necessary for sex.  The narration now moves back several years to Mandar's early teenage years. The year is 1989, Mandar along with his cousin Dilip (nicknamed Yusuf as a tribute to the thespian) visits his village in [[Maharashtra]] where their cousin Kshitij is already waiting for them. 15 year old Kshitij is studying in a military school and is mature beyond his years in his views and aspects about marriage, love and sex. By the end of their vacation Mandar realises that he is no longer a kid. His life becomes more exotic as he starts to woo girls, watching adult films and fantasizing about ladies.  Later in the year 1995, Mandar is now grown up and is an engineering student in [[Pune]]. There also he is accompanied by his cousins Dilip and Kshitij; the latter is an army officer by now. Mandar stalks Parul (Veera Saxena) only for having sex with her. While making out in the hostel room, they are caught by the warden and Mandar gets expelled from the hostel, leading him to rent a small flat. There he meets a beautiful housewife Jyotsna ([[Sai Tamhankar]]) and sets his sights on her. The dapper Kshitij, in the meanwhile, beds a steady parade of stunning girls at Mandar's flat. In a side plot, one of Kshitij's many girlfriends has a friend Anju who is being sexually abused by her own father. Incensed on learning of this heinous act, Kshitij beats up the father and takes Anju and her kid brother away thus rescuing them. The ordinary looking Anju has a maturity and strength that gradually makes Kshitij fall in love with her. In an amusing scene, Mandar and Dilip talk about how Kshitij didn't fall for any of the pretty girls he was seeing, but fell in love with a dark complexioned plain girl. They both conclude with a racist joke that love is not only blind but color blind! Kshitij marries Anju and they eventually have a son.  Getting back to Mandar's dalliance with Jyotsana, their casual flirting gradually reaches a point where they start an affair. Hers is a marriage that has petered into nothingness, given her husband has let himself go out of shape and humour. Jyotsna needing sexual fulfillment finds it in Mandar. Their furtive affair carries on for a while, Jyotsana visiting Mandar's flat from time to time, before Deepak finds out. Once again Mandar is forced to shift residences and finally ends up staying with Dilip. In 1996, Mandar meets Parul again in order to keep in touch with her and is left heartbroken when he finds her with another guy, Alok.  After college, Mandar is shown working a full-time job but is involved in a [[booty call]] arrangement with an older married woman who goes by the name [[Savita Bhabhi]]. After years of loveless one night stands, he takes Dilip's advise and decides to meet some girls through matrimonial sites. His strategy of being honest about his past affairs upsets most potential matches who are orthodox, conservative girls. When he finally meets Tripti Gokhale ([[Radhika Apte]]), he is so smitten by her that he decides not be honest, but instead projects a holier-than-thou image. This almost backfires, as Tripti turns out to be a very open-minded girl who has no hang-ups about her own past and admits to having been in relationships before. Now stuck in a lie, Mandar has to continue projecting himself as an orthodox, colourless man. All the same, the two continue to meet and start liking each other.  In due course, Kshitij is killed in an encounter with insurgents in Kashmir. Mandar again is left heartbroken from losing his cousin and friend. This incident brings Tripti close to him as she comforts him. They eventually get engaged, but Mandar is having a tough time with the idea of monogamy. He has one last encounter with Savita Bhabhi. Worse still, while on an errand to pick up a distant relative (Rachel D'Souza) from the airport, Mandar assumes that the person hasn't turned up and instead tries to pick up an attractive woman who turns out to be the distant relative. Embarrassed and shamed, Mandar barely gets out of the situation by the skin of his teeth.  At this point, Tripti's ex-boyfriend Chaxx ([[Suraj Jagan]]) enters the equation. Cool, suave and charming, Chaxx is all that Mandar is not. That, and Tripti's history with Chaxx trouble him no end and make him insecure to the point where he assumes that Tripti is leaving him for Chaxx. Mandar decides to confess the truth about his sex obsession to Tripti and does so. Tripti also reveals that she got pregnant when she was with Chaxx and there was nothing between them as they have broken up. Tripti makes it clear to Mandar that Chaxx abandoned her when she needed him the most and therefore she can never take him back. She also tells him that Mandar is her present and she wants a future with him.  The film concludes with Mandar very happy as he is getting married to the girl he loves as he narrates the mishaps between Tripti and himself to his cousin Dilip.  
Hyena Road
 In [[Kandahar Province]], Afghanistan, the [[Canadian Forces]] are encountering resistance from insurgents as they construct "Hyena Road" deep into [[Taliban]] territory.   Warrant Officer Ryan Sanders, the leader of a sniper section, finds himself under heavy fire while on sentry duty on the road. After their assigned evacuation vehicles are unable to reach their location, the section moves on foot and reaches a Pashtun village. They are harboured by a tribal elder in his home, who sends the Taliban away after they attack the village while searching for the Canadians.  Sanders and his section evacuate the area and return to base, where his secret lover Captain Jennifer Bowman, a Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI) officer, is also stationed.  Meanwhile, Captain Pete Mitchell, an intelligence officer, carries out normal duties as the road is constructed, with little help from the Canadian's Afghan allies. When he hears Sanders' story of the Afghan elder, he decides to search for the man as a potential ally. He is helped in his search by a local asset assisting against the Taliban, called The Cleaner.  While a search of the village yields nothing, Sanders is able to remember that the elder has eyes of two different colours, with one being brown and the other blue. Mitchell is immediately able to identify the man as "the Ghost", a former fighter against the Soviets who gained his nickname for disappearing every time he was wounded, as his comrades would take him across the mountains into Pakistan, out of the range of the Soviets.   Mitchell eventually arranges a meeting with the Ghost, but he refuses to accept money as a deal for his help, stating that "Only a fool accepts a gift without knowing what it's for".  Meanwhile, the Canadians' Afghan ally, Bashir Daoud Khan (BDK) and his son, Karim, are double-crossing them and are working with the Taliban. Sanders' section sees this firsthand while observing the Ghost visit his son's home and granddaughters. The home was situated on land owned by BDK, while the crops had been destroyed by a Coalition airstrike some time in the past, leaving the Ghost's son with nothing to give BDK as his tithe for protection.  Soon after the Ghost leaves, BDK arrives with Taliban protection and instructs the Ghost's son to pay up his money. When the son states that the entire opium crop was destroyed, BDK kidnaps the Ghost's granddaughters. Sander's fireteam observe the whole scene, but Mitchell repeatedly instructs them to hold their fire as they do not fully understand local politics. While everyone in the Canadian intelligence group knows their Afghan allies are crooked, there is no alternative in the province and they need all the help they can get.  Meanwhile, Bowman reveals to Sanders that she is pregnant with his son, conceived while both were on leave. Sanders rejoices in this, despite it being a serious problem regarding military regulations prohibiting fraternization.  The Canadians follow the Ghost, who has declared a personal war against BDK in revenge for the kidnapping of the girls. With assistance from his tribe, the Ghost abducts BDK's son Karim and beheads him when he is unable to reveal the location of the girls. Following this, the Ghost arranges a meeting with BDK in an isolated house, at the same time when BDK is supposed to be with the Canadians as they commemorate the opening of Hyena road.  BDK agrees to exchange the girls for Karim. However, when BDK arrives with his bodyguards in a convoy, he demands to know the location of his son. The Ghost responds by opening a sack he has brought and holding up Karim's severed head, at which point BDK pulls out his pistol and threatens to kill the Ghost.  Sanders and his section, who have been observing the incident, fires on BDK as they have positive intent of violence. They do not, however, know that the Ghost desired to die having nothing else to live for, and only wanted to avenge his grandchildren who he assumed were lost forever.  As the section pulls out, dozens of Taliban insurgents arrive and they are trapped with the Ghost around the house. Although they fight off the insurgents, there is no support available and the Canadians are pinned down. After Travis, a member of Sanders' section, is shot in the head by a sniper, the section decides to relocate into the house under heavy enemy fire.  As they move, they run into an IED, incapacitating the section, with only Sanders and the Ghost surviving. Recognizing that there is no escape, Sanders calls for an artillery strike on his location to eliminate the insurgents. After apologizing for the last time to Bowman, who desperately tries to countermand the order, Sanders tells the Ghost that he was going to be a father, something the Ghost appears to understand despite him not speaking English. Moments later, the artillery rounds hit the house obliterating Sanders, the Ghost, and many of the Taliban insurgents around them.  Later, Canadian troops rescue numerous Afghan children including the Ghost's granddaughters from one of BDK's safehouses, having acted on the Cleaner's information and other assets. The film ends with the ramp ceremony for Sanders and his section as Mitchell talks about how things will eventually get better, in the long term.

I'll See You in My Dreams (2015 film)
  Widow and former songstress Carol Petersen lives alone in California with her dog, Hazel. Her life is very routine, especially since she has not had a serious relationship in the twenty years since her husband has died and has no desire to begin dating or marrying again. She has no grandchildren, and her only daughter Katherine lives in a different state. One day she is forced to put the elderly dog down, leaving her without her main companion outside of her friends Georgina, Rona, and Sally who all live at a retirement community. After coming home from the appointment, she finds a large rat in her house, which leads her to sleep outside for the night, at which point she meets her new pool boy, Lloyd. Though Lloyd initially offends her by implying that she seemed dead, the two begin an unlikely friendship after Lloyd asks to meet with her as friends.  While looking at vitamins in her local drugstore, Carol meets Bill, who flirts with her before leaving; she is clearly intrigued by him. Later, her friends convince her to go to a speed dating session for senior citizens. Though Carol is uninterested in the men she meets, she later encounters Bill in the parking lot, and he asks her for her number so that he can call her for a date. Carol goes home and calls Lloyd to go to karaoke. Though Lloyd is a mediocre singer, Carol impresses him with her singing ability. They go back to her house, and they discuss "living in the moment," which concerns Lloyd but is something that Carol dismisses. Lloyd reveals that he's not looking forward to anything in his life, and that he feels he has no real prospects outside of the responsibility he feels for his ailing mother.  The next day, Carol gets a message from her daughter Katherine (Kat), who hasn't visited in a while but decided spur of the moment to visit. She also gets a message from Bill, who wants to see her and asks that she meet him at the retirement community where he also lives. She meets with him and he takes her out on his boat, the "So What" - something, he says, he has never done with anyone else. The two quickly connect. Bill tells her that he is originally from Texas, but decided to move to California and buy a boat on a whim, as he did not want to be the sort of retiree who fell into boring, stagnated routines. After dinner, Bill drives her home, and they share a kiss; Bill says that he wants to see her again. Carol is giddy, until she sees the rat again.  Carol begins to open herself up to being more adventurous again, and she and her friends get high, steal a grocery cart after shopping, and evade a curious policeman. When she gets home, she has messages from Katherine, reminding her about her visit, and Bill, wanting to set up another date. After the date, she invites Bill to her home and the two have sex and talk intimately. Bill spends the night and it is obvious that they are very much taken with one another. Over breakfast, Bill asks Carol if she ever considered marrying again. Carol lightheartedly scoffs and says she hardly knows him. Their conversation is interrupted by a knock at the door. Carol opens it part way to find Lloyd standing there, and he tells her that he quit his job, though he did get a job as a pool cleaner at another business. Carol is obviously reluctant to invite Lloyd in, but Bill, in his T-shirt comes up behind her, introductions are made and Bill invites Lloyd to breakfast. Awkwardly, Lloyd says he just wanted to let Carol know about the new job and leaves.  Bill wants to see Carol again, but she tells him that she has to spend time with Katherine; he says that he'd like to meet her daughter someday, and Carol is noncommittal. They part ways affectionately. Katherine arrives, and notes that Carol seems different, in a good way: she seems more open, positive, and thoughtful. Carol tells her that she is seeing someone, which makes Katherine happy, and Katherine insists that she wants to meet him. However, Carol finds frantic messages from Rona on her answering machine when they get back home; Bill is in the hospital for an unknown condition.  Since only immediate family can see him, Carol is unable to be admitted, though the nurse promises that she will get a call about his condition. Sadly, she soon gets a call that he has died, and grieves that he has died, that she has lost someone again. She asks Katherine why people bother getting attached when death is inevitable, a sentiment she expressed to Lloyd earlier; Katherine points out all the good things that happened because of Carol taking chances and risks; she led a full life, and Carol says all those things are in the past. Kat tells her mother that she isn't in the past, that she is right there with her mother. Carol's grief is palpable, but after her daughter has returned to New York, she once again gets back to the routines of playing golf and cards with her friends. She makes a trip down to where Bill's boat is still moored, and in conversation over cards one of her friends askes about the boat, which Carol says is still there, that there was no one to leave the boat to, and that she'd asked Bill's lawyer if she could have something of Bill's as a keepsake. We don't learn whether there was anything given to her, but one day, as she is at home dusting the items on her fireplace mantel - framed family photos, a large urn (presumably containing her husband's ashes) and a little flower print tin containing her dog's remains - she finds a cellophane-wrapped cigar laying there, the type that Bill always had tucked in his mouth, unlit, an old habit he hadn't quite given up on.  Lloyd comes to visit Carol in his new uniform. The rat appears again and he manages to trap it, and afterwards Carol finally breaks down in tears over losing Bill. Lloyd comforts her and plays for her a poignant song that he wrote, "I'll See You in My Dreams." Later, Carol meets with her friends, and Sally insists that they should all go on a cruise together. Though the other friends are reluctant at first, Carol impulsively agrees, leading the others to join in. The film ends with Carol adopting an elderly dog and driving home with him, taking another chance at love.  
I Spit on Your Grave III: Vengeance Is Mine
 The film follows the life of [[Jennifer Hills]], continuing her story from ''[[I Spit on Your Grave (2010 film)|I Spit on Your Grave]]''. After Jennifer survived her assault and exacted revenge on the men who raped her, she avoided conviction for her killing spree and settled in Los Angeles. She is no longer an aspiring writer and now devotes herself between working as an assault hotline operator and going to group counseling under the assumed name Angela Jitrenka. She is also periodically shown attending personal therapy for her ordeal. Jennifer's scarring experience has left her highly distrustful and defensive towards most men, including her colleague Matthew, who has a seemingly genuine interest in her.  While in group counseling, Jennifer develops a bond with one of the girls in the group, Marla, who also does not trust men. The duo began their own personal crusade, by exacting poetic justice for victims of sexual assault. However, just as Jennifer begins to enjoy life, Marla dies under mysterious circumstances and no one is found guilty of her death. She becomes acquainted with Detective McDylan, an investigator to Marla's death who, however, fails to bring justice for Marla nor closure for Jennifer. Distraught and enraged at how the law could not help Marla nor the rape victims in her support group, she decides to get revenge for them.  One by one, Jennifer stalks and lures the unpunished rapists to a private place to torture and kill them. Her first victim is Marla's estranged boyfriend and alleged murderer, soon followed by the stepfather of a teenage member of the group. After befriending Oscar, the only male member of the support group who lost his daughter to suicide after a sexual assault, Jennifer tracks down his daughter's rapist. The man manages to overpower her as she tries to attack him, until he is shot dead by the police, whose attention Jennifer had been drawing through her actions. The police take Jennifer in for questioning, revealing their knowledge of her real identity in an attempt to obtain a confession. However Oscar, who had grown sympathetic to Jennifer's cause, walks into the police station after slashing his own arms, and publicly admits to the murders before dying from his wounds.  No longer the prime suspect, Jennifer is released but stays under police watch as a person of interest. She has a nervous breakdown, becoming further disillusioned with society and no longer able to discern well-meaning men from sexual predators. Clad in a suggestive red dress in order to bait men, Jennifer leaves her home, evading the police watch. First she unsuccessfully attacks Matthew and scares him away, then she tries to lure a local thug who had been harassing her. As Jennifer is about to kill him, she is shot and arrested by McDylan, who had been trailing her the whole time.  It is now revealed Jennifer's personal therapy sessions were part of her mandatory treatment following a two-year sentence for attempted murder, lacking evidence of the murders she actually committed. After completing the final session before her release, Jennifer leaves the doctor's office and switches the "therapist" sign on the door to read "the rapist". She then runs into two inmates and imagines killing both as well as her therapist, revealing that her fantasies of killing are not over and have extended beyond the motive of avenging rape victims.

The Idol (2015 film)
 ''The Idol'' tells a fictionalized version of the life of [[Mohammed Assaf]], wedding singer from a refugee camp in Gaza who went to win 2013's ''[[Arab Idol]]'' singing competition.  The film starts out in 2005 in Gaza. Mohammed is a young child, playing in a band together with his [[tomboy]] sister Nour and two friends. Recognizing the possibilities Mohammed's incredible voice has to offer, they set out to become a real band and are soon asked to play at weddings. Nour, however, collapses during a performance and is found to have [[kidney failure]], requiring her to undergo weekly dialysis or for her family to buy her a kidney transplant. As the transplant is far too expensive, Mohammed makes it his goal to raise enough money as a singer to purchase it. He takes singing lessons and befriends a girl named Amal, also suffering from kidney disease, during Nour's dialysis sessions. In spite of treatment, Nour dies, and Mohammed is left disillusioned and depressed.  Seven years later, in 2012, Mohammed performs with a band for the show ''Palestinian Idol'', but the travel restrictions on Gaza prevent him from actually going to the studio in [[Ramallah]] and force him to perform over Skype. The poor conditions of Gaza electricity affect the performance, frustrating Mohammed, who wants to quit singing until he meets Amal again. She inspires him, and with the support of his family, Mohammed decides to audition for ''[[Arab Idol]]''. Crossing the border from Gaza into [[Egypt]], where the auditions will take place, is near impossible, and Mohammed gets caught with a fake passport at the [[Rafah Border Crossing]], but after performing a religious song for the border clerk, he is admitted through, with a warning that it may be difficult for him to ever return. In [[Cairo]], Mohammed finds the auditions already underway and all the slots taken, forcing him to break into the building where a young singer offers Mohammed his slot after hearing him sing on the toilet. Mohammed successfully auditions for the show and is soon is allowed a pass to [[Beirut]] to take part in the main competition.  As the show progresses, Mohammed's reputation grows among the Palestinians, who are shown to be ecstatic that a Palestinian man is performing so well and winning such acclaim, emboldening the Palestinian national pride and inspiring hope and optimism. The pressure of this gets to Mohammed, who has a [[panic attack]] right before an important rehearsal. With the support of one of the audition judges and Amal (over the phone), Mohammed picks himself up and gets back to performing. The film ends by switching to real-life footage of Mohammed Assaf winning the ''Arab Idol'' title, followed by a brief overview of Assaf's life after the finale.

In the Heart of the Sea (film)
 In 1850, author [[Herman Melville]] visits innkeeper [[Thomas Nickerson]], the last survivor of the sinking of the whaleship ''[[Essex (whaleship)|Essex]]'', offering money in return for his story. Nickerson initially refuses, but finally agrees when his wife intervenes.  The story turns to 1820: a [[whaling]] company in [[Nantucket]] has refitted the ''Essex'' to participate in the lucrative [[whale oil]] trade, and 14-year-old Nickerson signs on as a [[cabin boy]]. The owners hire veteran whaler [[Owen Chase]] as first mate, though he is disappointed not to receive a captain's commission. The captain is [[George Pollard, Jr.|George Pollard]], an inexperienced mariner from an established whaling family who envies Chase's skill and popularity. Chase and Pollard clash, leading Pollard to sail into a storm against Chase's advice. The two agree to put their differences aside, rather than risking their reputations by returning to port without profit, and soon, the crew kills their first bull sperm whale.  Three months pass with no further successes, and Pollard realizes that the [[Atlantic Ocean]] holds no sighting of whales. The ''Essex'' sails past [[Cape Horn]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], hoping for better luck in catching one. In [[Atacames]], [[Ecuador]], the officers meet a Spanish captain who tells them his crew found the bountiful "Offshore Grounds" 2,000 miles to the west, but claims that a vengeful "white whale" destroyed his ship, killing six of his men. Denying the story as a myth, Pollard and Chase lead the expedition west. They find the undisturbed grounds, but when they launch the whaling boats, the white whale, a massive [[Albinism in biology|albino]] bull [[sperm whale]] attacks, damaging the boats and turning on the ship.  Chase [[harpoon]]s it from the ''Essex''s deck, but the whale staves the ship in half, killing two men. The crew abandons the sinking ''Essex'' in the three intact whaling boats, and must sail hundreds of miles to shore with very limited supplies. The whale follows and attacks again, but they escape to the tiny [[Henderson Island (Pitcairn Islands)|Henderson Island]]. While gathering food, Chase discovers the corpses of earlier castaways, and concludes that the crew will soon die on the island before another ship passes by. Four men decide to stay, while the rest set sail again on the boats with hopes to find land. Soon after, one of the men dies, and the remaining crew reluctantly decide to [[Cannibalism|cannibalize]] him.  The older Nickerson is overcome by emotion and stops his story; however, when his wife comforts him, he feels encouraged enough to finish. Back in the 1820s, the three boats separate and one is lost. The other two further resort to cannibalism to survive, with Pollard's cousin Henry Coffin sacrificing himself.  The whale returns, and Chase gets into position for a final attack. The whale breaches for a moment, allowing Chase to observe a portion of his previously thrown harpoon still embedded in the whale's skull. Chase hesitates, and stares into the whale's left eye. He decides not to attack. Following this encounter, the whale swims away peacefully, and is never seen again.  A passing ship rescues Pollard's boat, but Chase's boat continues to drift with no food or water. Finally, with the survivors on the verge of death, they reach land. The survivors return to Nantucket and finally reunite with their distraught families. The ship's owners ask Pollard and Chase to cover up the story to protect the industry, but after Chase refuses to go along, Pollard reveals the truth in the inquiry.  Nickerson relates that a ship was sent to Henderson Island to rescue the surviving men there, Chase continued sailing the seas and became a merchant captain, and Pollard led another expedition to kill the whale, but the ship wrecked and he was forced to retire. Melville departs, to compose his novel, ''[[Moby-Dick]],'' beginning by writing its first line: "[[Ishmael (Moby-Dick)|Call me Ishmael]]".

Indru Netru Naalai
 In the year 2065, a scientist ([[Arya (actor)|Arya]]) invents a time machine. To prove its capability, he sends it back in time to 2015, programming it to return within forty seconds. However, the machine does not return.  The time machine is seen by three people in 2015&nbsp;— Elango ([[Vishnu Vishal|Vishnu]]), a budding entrepreneur whose ideas are rejected by all and who is struggling to maintain his relationship with his rich girlfriend Anu ([[Miya (actress)|Miya]]), who is embarrassed at the fact that Elango is unemployed; Elango's best friend Pulivetti Arumugam ([[Karunakaran (actor)|Karunakaran]]), a fake astrologer; and an inventor Giridhara Parthasarathy ([[T. M. Karthik]]), who makes a living by repairing home appliances. The three of them are involved in an accident and witness the time machine while recovering from the shock. While Parthasarathy decides to keep the time machine for himself, he suffers an electric shock and ends up in a coma, prompting Elango and Arumugam to steal the time machine from Parthasarathy's shop. The duo use the time machine to make Arumugam's astrology practice extremely successful by going back in time and finding things lost by people under the guise of astrology. Elango further uses the machine to impress Anu's industrialist father Rajarathinam ([[Jayaprakash]]) by going to the future, obtaining the stock market results and successfully "predicting" them in front of Rajarathinam and his company's board of directors. Rajarathinam soon approves the marriage of Anu with Elango.  Things go smoothly until Elango and Arumugam inadvertently thwart an encounter to kill Kuzhandaivelu ([[P. Ravi Shankar]]), a dreaded gangster and extortionist who is targeting Rajarathinam, during one of their trips to the past to find yet another item of one of Arumugam's clients. In the present day, Kuzhandaivelu is plotting to kill Rajarathinam for his role in planning the encounter and also Elango and Arumugam for (unknowingly) attacking him in a parking lot. Elango and Anu's marriage is postponed indefinitely as a result.  Elango and Arumugam go back to the past to fix their mistake, but Kuzhandaivelu accidentally shoots the time machine while fighting a police officer during the encounter, damaging it. The duo find Parthasarathy, who has woken up from his coma but doesn't remember them, and ask him to fix the time machine. While Parthasarathy manages to fix the time machine, due to a lack of specific parts which have not yet been developed, it can only take the user to a specific time in the past (when Kuzhandaivelu damaged the time machine) and also as the date cannot be changed, the user cannot return to the future. Therefore, the duo decide not to use it. Later, Kuzhandaivelu spots Elango, Arumugam and Anu at a mall and pursues them. He opens fire during the chase, killing Anu. To ensure that Anu remains alive, Elango decides to use the time machine to return to the past and kill Kuzhandaivelu, even though he cannot return. But Kuzhandaivelu spots the duo and while fighting them, all three of them fall into the time machine and go to the past. In the past, Kuzhandaivelu destroys the time machine, but Elango manages to kill Kuzhandaivelu. Then, Elango and Arumugam stop themselves from finding the time machine by thwarting the accident involving them and Parthasarathy.  The next morning, Elango wakes up in a bed, remembering only the events of the previous night. He soon finds out, to his surprise, that he is in a marriage hall and that he is getting married to Anu on that day. He does not remember, to Anu's bewilderment, any of the events which had occurred in the past two months as a result of his usage of the time machine during that period. He finds out that, without finding the time machine, he got a job and managed to impress Rajarathinam with one of his business ideas, leading to his marriage with Anu. Arumugam, who also doesn't remember anything over the past two months, is happily married. Elango and Arumugam soon find out that Kuzhandaivelu had died two months ago. They also run into Parthasarathy, who does not recognise them as they had never met.  Since the time machine was never seen, it returned to 2065, making it a success.

Infini
 In the early 23rd century, an emergency is declared on a mining station ''O.I. Infini'' and a search and rescue (SAR) team is sent in using [[Slipstream (science fiction)|Slipstream]], a form of teleportation that allows near instantaneous travel. The location of ''O.I. Infini'' is proximal to a number of black holes meaning the mission operatives will experience severe time dilation. A team sent returns 30 seconds later in a berserk rage. Whit Carmichael, a new member of West Coast SAR, on his first day, teleports to ''Infini'' using an illegal teleporter after West Coast HQ activates a lethal lock down to contain the crisis. Before leaving for work that day, his wife tells him to do whatever it takes to return safely.  Less than a relative hour later, East Coast SAR is informed about the outbreak and the destruction of the West Coast SAR. They are informed a payload of something from the station has been programmed by a deranged survivor to teleport soon to Earth, which will destroy the planet. The SAR is ordered to halt the payload and recover the one surviving member of the West Coast SAR, Whit. Arriving, they find a frozen slaughterhouse, eventually reuniting with Whit, who has had a week to figure out how the station operates. Whit explains that the mining staff slaughtered each other, tearing off their skin and killing one another. Whit is able to shut down the payload, but the deranged survivor suddenly attacks. Everyone is sprayed with the survivor's blood after he is shot and becomes violently enraged. Whit hides from the others, then searches the station for remaining SAR personnel and anything he can learn about the infection. Finding a lab, he discovers a medical log that reveals the planet is entirely composed of alien organic material that when thawed forms a so-called "primordial ooze". It is capable of infecting, mimicking, and finally dominating any biological tissue. He further discovers the ooze is aggressive, predatory in nature, and driven by self-preservation.  Suffering mentally from infection, Whit attempts to solicit help from the remaining members of the team, but they are suffering through advanced stages of the infection, which he is resisting better. They either attack each other, kill themselves, or attack Whit. This leaves Whit the last surviving human on the station. He records a message to the ooze which plays on a loop over the loudspeakers, criticizing it for harnessing only the violent instincts of humanity, instead of working with humans. He tells it that it failed and commits suicide. The ooze moves onto the bodies, and they awaken unharmed and no longer crazed, but clearly disturbed by what has happened. They agree to teleport back and keep their story simple.  As they begin to teleport, Whit sees several humanoid forms made of ooze, silently watching them go.  One of them holds the picture of Whit's wife he carried with him.  Returning to Earth, the team is scanned and asked if they are free from biological contaminants. They answer in the affirmative, and the scan clears them all.  Whit returns home to his wife, who had been told he was not coming back.

Inside Out (2015 film)
   Riley Andersen is born in [[Minnesota]]. Within her mind's Headquarters, five personifications of her [[Emotion#Basic emotions|basic emotions]] — Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger — come to life and influence her actions via a control console. As she grows up, her experiences become memories, stored in colored orbs, which are sent into [[long-term memory]] each night. Her five most important "core memories" (all happy ones) are housed in a hub; each powers an aspect of her personality which takes the form of floating islands. Joy acts as a ''de facto'' leader, and since she and the other emotions do not understand Sadness' purpose, she tries to keep Sadness away from the console.  At the age of 11, Riley and her parents move to [[San Francisco]] for her father's new business. Riley has poor first experiences: the new house is cramped and old, the moving van with their belongings is misdirected, and her father is under stress from his business. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness accidentally causes Riley to cry in front of her class, creating a sad core memory. Joy, panicking, tries to dispose of it, but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters and taken to the maze-like storage area of long-term memory.  Anger, Fear, and Disgust try to maintain Riley's happiness in Joy's absence with disastrous results, distancing her from her parents, friends, and hobbies. As a result, her personality islands gradually crumble and fall, one by one, into the "Memory Dump", an abyss where memories are forgotten. Finally, Anger inserts an idea into the console, prompting Riley to [[Runaway (dependent)|run away]] to Minnesota.  While navigating through the long-term memory region, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong, Riley's childhood [[imaginary friend]], who suggests riding the [[train of thought]] back to Headquarters. En route to the train station, Bing Bong tearfully watches his rainbow wagon rocket being thrown into the memory dump along with other unused childish artifacts. The three eventually catch the train, but it halts when Riley falls asleep, then derails entirely when "Honesty Island" collapses due to Riley's theft of her mother's credit card. In desperation, Joy abandons Sadness and tries to ride a "recall tube" back to Headquarters, but the ground below the tube collapses, breaking it and plunging Joy and Bing Bong into the Memory Dump.  At the bottom of the abyss, Joy begins to lose hope and breaks into tears, but then discovers a sad memory of an [[ice hockey]] game that turned happy when Riley's parents and friends comforted her. Joy finally realizes Sadness's purpose: to induce [[empathy]] in others, prompting them to reach out to Riley when she is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help. Joy and Bing Bong try to use the wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump. After several tries, Bing Bong, who is already fading away, jumps out to allow Joy to escape and is forgotten.  Joy reunites with a despondent Sadness and takes them to Headquarters, only to discover that Anger's idea has disabled the console, rendering Riley [[apathy|apathetic]]. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, who is able to extract the idea, reactivating the console and prompting Riley to return home. As Sadness re-installs the core memories, turning them sad, Riley arrives home to her parents and tearfully confesses that she misses Minnesota and her old life. Her parents comfort her and admit they, too, miss Minnesota as much as she does. Joy and Sadness work the console together, creating a new amalgamated bitter-sweet core memory in Riley's Headquarters; a new island forms, representing Riley's acceptance of her new life in San Francisco.  A year later at the age of 12, Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, and returned to her old hobbies while adopting a few new ones. Inside the Headquarters, her emotions all work together on a newly expanded console with room for them all.  
Insidious: Chapter 3
  Several years before [[Insidious (film)|The Lambert Haunting]], retired [[demonology|demonologist]] Elise Rainier reluctantly uses her abilities to contact the spirit of teenager Quinn Brenner's mother, Lillith, who died a year prior.  However, she urges Quinn not to try and contact her mother again after sensing a malevolent force.  After auditioning for a school for the performing arts, Quinn sees a mysterious figure waving to her from the distance on the street.  Distracted, she is accidentally hit by a car, having both of her legs broken in the process.  Now stuck in her home with her father Sean and brother Alex, Quinn begins to experience increasingly disturbing [[paranormal|paranormal phenomena]], including seeing visions of a dark spirit wearing an [[oxygen mask]] known as the "Man Who Can't Breathe" - the same figure that caused her accident.  Sean later tries to convince Elise, who like him is still grieving after the loss of her husband Jack, to help his daughter, but Elise declines, stating that her previous visits to the dark spiritual world of the "Further" made her realize that an evil spirit is hunting to kill her.  However, she is convinced by her friend and former colleague Carl to continue using her spiritual ability, reminding her about her successful [[Insidious: Chapter 2|case involving Josh Lambert]] in 1986, and stating that she is stronger than any spirits or demons because she is living and they are not.  Due to Elise's refusal, Alex suggests Sean call on alleged demonologists Specs and Tucker, who have built a following on the [[internet]].  During their investigation, Quinn's possession grows increasingly worse as she, now briefly possessed by the demon, breaks through her leg braces and attempts to attack Sean, Specs, and Tucker.  Realizing that Specs and Tucker are scammers, Sean prepares to kick the duo out until Elise arrives.  Deducing that the demon's goal is to lure potential victims to "the Further" so it can eat their life force, Elise decides to enter the spiritual world with Specs and Tucker recording any activities and words she spells out.  With the help of a spirit who likewise is a victim of the "Man Who Can't Breathe," Elise enters the Further and after a brief encounter with the evil spirit that haunts her (a mysterious [[Insidious: Chapter 2|"Bride in Black"]]), she meets with the spirit of Jack, whom she realizes is the "Man Who Can't Breathe" in disguise.  After managing to briefly escape him, Elise returns to the material world and realizes that Quinn has to defeat him on her own. Though Quinn is at first at a disadvantage, Elise reads a message that the Brenners' late neighbor had tried to tell Quinn of: that Lillith left her with a letter to read before she graduated High School, but never found it.  Lillith's spirit then appears and helps Quinn fully take control of her body and defeat the "Man Who Can't Breathe," after which Quinn is finally able to escape the further for good.  Elise leaves after giving parting words to the family, including words of encouragement from Lillith's spirit.  Following the Brenner' successful case, Elise decides to come out of retirement and work with Specs and Tucker.  She arrives home and notices a figure watching her from outside.  Thinking that it is Jack at first, Elise realizes that it is something malevolent before the [[Insidious (film)|Lipstick-Face Demon]] suddenly appears behind her.  
The Intern (2015 film)
 Seventy-year-old widower Ben Whittaker, a retired executive from [[DEX One]], applies to a senior citizen intern program, after retirement has become too boring for him. He applies to About The Fit, a fast-growing [[e-commerce]] fashion startup in [[Brooklyn]]. Founder and CEO Jules Ostin had previously agreed to a community outreach program where seniors would intern at the firm. Ben impresses everyone and is one of four hired.  Ben is assigned to work with Jules, who is somewhat skeptical at first. Initially frozen out by her, Ben slowly wins over co-workers with his congeniality and gets into Jules's good graces. Ben heads to work one day extra early to organize a messy desk that Jules had complained about previously. After work, Ben notices Jules's chauffeur drinking, convinces the driver to leave and drives Jules home himself, a role he retains in days to come.  Ben eventually reveals that he once worked in the very same building where About The Fit is now based. He develops a romantic relationship with the in-house massage therapist, Fiona, and becomes something of a father figure to several of the younger workers: by offering advice about issues such as love, clothes sense and work/life balance. He provides another with a place to stay at his [[brownstone]] after being evicted by his parents. Ben becomes very committed to Jules, and even breaks into the house of Jules' mother to delete an embarrassingly scathing email, narrowly avoiding getting arrested in the process. Ben also gets to know Jules' family. Her husband, Matt, gave up his own career to be a [[stay-at-home dad]] to their daughter, Paige (JoJo Kushner), when About The Fit started to take off. However, their marriage is slowly breaking apart as the couple grows more distant.  Meanwhile, Jules is under pressure to give up her post of CEO to someone outside of the company as her investors feel that she is unable to cope with the workload, having grown About The Fit from a startup founded in her kitchen to a 220-employee juggernaut in only eighteen months. Believing it will give her more time at home with her family, Jules is willing to consider the proposal. When driving Paige home from a party, Ben discovers that Matt is having an affair with another parent at Paige's school. While on a business trip in [[San Francisco]] to interview a potential CEO candidate, Jules reveals that she knows about Matt's cheating, but did not confront Matt about it because she was not ready to deal with it.  In an effort to buy herself time to save her marriage, Jules decides to hire a prospective CEO. When Jules goes to Ben's home the next day, Ben greatly encourages Jules to think about how much this will change her authority and how her creativity may be hindered and also reminds her of her passion for her company. Matt unexpectedly drops in at the office and urges her to reconsider, saying that he is sorry, ashamed, and wants to support her in her dreams. Jules goes out looking for Ben, wanting to tell him that she has changed her mind and finds him enjoying his [[Tai chi|Tai Chi]] exercise group. She finally lets herself relax and joins him.

Shortly after, while cutting down a tree in the forest, the girls' father has an accident and cuts his leg with a chain saw. Before dying he tells the girls to take care of each other and love one another.  The girls struggle onwards for two months as they run low on food. They are surprised one night by a knock on the door that turns out to be Eli, who walked there looking for Nell. He tells the sisters that he had searched the surrounding houses and they are all abandoned. Nell and Eli sleep together several times and he finally tells her that he heard that out east there is still electricity, internet, and order. He convinces Nell to go with him, but Eva chooses to remain behind. Nell briefly leaves but then turns back after a night away from home, unwilling to leave Eva.  Reunited, the girls begin to do research on the plants in the forest and use it to collect berries and other edibles. One day, after Nell gets her period and realizes she is not pregnant, she encourages Eva to celebrate by getting drunk with her, and the two use some of their gas on the generator and watch home movies of their deceased parents, and Eva dances to music for the first time in half a year.  The following day Nell goes to collect berries while Eva stays behind and chops wood. She is approached by Stan, who rapes her. As a result, the girls become more reclusive, boarding up the house and refusing to go outside. Nell tries to help Eva with her depression, playing her a song and revealing that she had actually hidden some of the gas and that Stan did not take all of it.  Eventually Eva realizes she is pregnant, which helps to jolt her out of her depression. Though Nell encourages her to try to abort the baby, Eva insists on keeping it, saying that she doesn't want to lose anyone else. During her pregnancy Eva states that she'll have a boy and Nell believes she'll have a girl. The two bet on the gas, saying that whoever correctly predicts the baby's gender will win the remaining gas.  During a storm several beams of the roof break and Eva begins to have contractions. The two sisters flee for a hollowed out tree stump that once served as their playhouse, where Eva gives birth to a baby boy. Returning to their now destroyed home, Eva decides to use her prize (the gasoline) to burn-down the remains of the house, so that passersby will think that they died in a fire and they will be safe from stragglers.  Rescuing a few precious items, the sisters burn down the house and then relocate to their new home, deep within the forest.

Will and Eden divorced while trying to cope with their young son Ty's accidental death. Eden met David at a grief support group, and their party will be the first time any of their friends have seen the couple in over two years. On the way, Will strikes and mercy-kills a coyote.  Will and Kira arrive. David and Eden's other dinner guests are Tommy, Tommy's boyfriend Miguel, and friends Ben, Claire, and Gina. Gina mentions that their other friend Choi is running late. Eden introduces Sadie, a girl she and David met while in Mexico who now stays with them.  Throughout the evening, Will wanders in his former home alone and relives memories related to Ty's death, including Eden's attempted suicide. In the kitchen, Will witnesses Eden slap Ben when he makes a joke about her New Age ideas on expelling pain. Eden and David's mysterious friend Pruitt arrives. Will notices that David locked the front door. Will later goes for firewood and spies Eden hiding a pill bottle through her bedroom window.  David and Eden tell their guests about a group they joined along with Pruitt and Sadie called "The Invitation" to work through grief using spiritual philosophy. David shows everyone a video in which group leader Dr. Joseph comforts a terminally ill woman as she takes her last breaths. David turns away unseen visitors and explains they were strangers looking for a party nearby. The group play a game of "I Want" where Sadie kisses Gina, Pruitt confesses to accidentally killing his wife, and Eden kisses Ben. David stops an unsettled Claire from leaving, making Will think David is keeping the guests inside. David changes his mind, and Claire leaves, accompanied by Pruitt, whose car is blocking Claire's.

Presuming that David and Eden must have done something to Choi, Will publicly confronts the couple about their apparent cult brainwashing. Choi enters unexpectedly, explaining that he was called away by work. Will is embarrassed, but the others assume his residual grief over Ty’s death is causing Will to behave irrationally.

Will, Kira, and Tommy flee and hide in the house.

Ip Man 3
 In 1959, [[Ip Man]] is settling into his low-profile life in Hong Kong. His elder son, [[Ip Chun]], has returned to [[Foshan]] to study, leaving him with his younger son [[Ip Ching]] and his wife Cheung Wing-sing in Hong Kong. A young [[Bruce Lee]] visits Ip and asks to become one of his students, saying he would be his greatest disciple. After Lee demonstrates his speed, Ip neither accepts nor rejects him, but insinuates for him to leave by opening the door.   After Ip Ching gets into a fight with his schoolmate, Cheung Fung, their teacher, Miss Wong, asks the parents to come to the school, though only the Ips arrive. As an apology, the Ip family invite Cheung Fung to their home for dinner. At Ip's house, Cheung Fung displays rudimentary yet impressive [[Wing Chun]] skills. When Ip asks the boy who his mentor is, he says that it is his father, Cheung Tin-chi, a poor rickshaw puller who shows up to pick up his son shortly after. Although he interacts cordially with Ip Man, he secretly envies Ip's wealth and popularity and seeks to surpass him, participating successfully in underground fights to earn extra money.   The organiser, Ma King-sang, a local [[Triad (organized crime)|triad]] leader, also works for Frank, an American property developer and highly proficient boxer. Frank orders Ma to acquire a piece of land occupied by the school where Ip Ching and Cheung Fung study. Ma asks for a month for it to be done, but is threatened into assuring that it will be done within two weeks. The next day, when Ip goes to pick up his son from school, he witnesses Ma and his men coercing and beating the headmaster, who refuses to sell them the school. Ip interferes and restrains Ma, but is forced to let him go. Ip seeks help from Sergeant "Fat Po", a close friend of his and a local police detective. Fat Po agrees to help Ip, but claims a shortage of manpower and influence. Ip then decides to guard the school alongside his students.   That night, they fend off an attack by Ma's men, who attempt to set fire to the school and kidnap the headmaster. Cheung, who happens to pass by, helps fight off the invaders and rescues the headmaster. Cheung's skills impress Ip, and he thanks Cheung for his help. Tin Ngo-san, a local martial arts master and Ma's former mentor, is enraged by Ma's unscrupulous acts, and accompanied by Ip, confronts Ma at the Hong Kong shipyard where he humiliates him in front of his men. Ma retaliates with a hidden knife, but Ip is able to stop him. Fat Po arrives and keeps the situation at bay, but Ip eventually lets Ma go again to de-escalate the situation. Ma finds Cheung and offers him a large sum of money to get revenge against Tin on his behalf. Desperate to open his own martial arts school, Cheung accepts the offer and is able to put Tin in the hospital. Ip receives a call from the hospital and visits Tin.   Upon learning that Tin did not call him, Ip realises that it was a set-up by Ma to lure him away from the school, so that his gang could kidnap some of the students, including Ip Ching and Cheung Fung. Ip arrives alone at Ma's shipyard, where Ma holds Ip Ching at knife point and threatens to sell the children into slavery if the headmaster refuses to surrender the school. Upon learning that his son was also kidnapped, Cheung arrives and is allowed to leave with his son due to being an associate; but after his son tells him that they still have his friends, he returns and fights alongside Ip. Ip and Cheung are able to hold their own until a troop of policemen led by Fat Po comes to arrest the gang, while Ma flees. After the incident, Frank dismisses Ma and sends a Thai boxer to go after Ip instead.  Returning home, Ip learns that Wing-sing has been diagnosed with [[cancer]] and may only live another six months. While taking Wing-sing home from a medicine shop, Ip is attacked in an elevator by the Thai boxer, who is defeated before the elevator reaches the ground floor. Fat Po later tells Ip about Frank, who wants to eliminate Ip at all costs for obstructing his plans. Ip decides to confront Frank in his office, where he engages Ip in a three-minute fight, promising to leave him alone if he can just last the three minutes. Ip is initially overwhelmed by his opponent's sheer muscle and force but begins turning the tide when he attacks Frank's lower half and they fight to a draw after the three minutes pass. Ip leaves the office and Frank keeps his promise, seemingly impressed.  Cheung, with the money he obtained from Ma earlier, opens his martial arts school, and claims that his Wing Chun is genuine while Ip's is not. Cheung proceeds to build his reputation by defeating a number of martial arts masters. Finally, he challenges Ip to a battle that will decide who is the true Grandmaster of Wing Chun. Meanwhile, Ip spends more time with his ailing wife, ashamedly feeling that he had neglected her earlier. On the day of the match, Ip chooses not to attend, but instead goes out dancing with Wing-sing, instructed by Bruce Lee, whom Ip finally accepts as a student. Owing to Ip's failure to attend, Cheung is declared the winner, although he seems unsatisfied by Ip's refusal to fight him. Wing-sing, despite being happy about Ip's decision to accompany her, makes an appointment with Cheung for another match on Ip's behalf, as she guesses that Ip would have attended if not for her condition.  Wing-sing accompanies Ip to the fight. After a battle with six and a half point poles, [[butterfly sword]]s and an empty-handed fight, Ip eventually overpowers Cheung with a [[one-inch punch]]. Accepting defeat, Cheung destroys the banner that proclaimed himself to be the Grandmaster. Ip tells him that their closest ones are more important than competing and leaves. In the epilogue, it is revealed that Wing-sing died in 1960, and that Ip helped make Wing Chun well known internationally and left a legacy.

Jackrabbit (film)
 Twenty-five years after an unspecified cataclysm known as "The Reset", tech company Vopo Technologies rebuilds society in City Six.  Although Vopo has access to modern technology, which they use to maintain control, the people scavenge for 1980s-era parts.  Simon, a computer technician, learns his best friend, Eric, has committed suicide.  At the funeral, he observes Max.  Max later sells scavenged computer parts to a shop where Simon works.  Though Max brushes off Simon's attempts to make conversation, he later comes back to request aid in decoding an encrypted message Eric sent him.  Max is disappointed to learn that Simon has quit his job to work for Vopo, as he believes Vopo to be untrustworthy.  Unbeknownst to Simon, at several points in the film Max is contacted on his computer by a mysterious remote user, sexybeast666, who repeatedly asks him if he has salvaged anything from 'the outside'. Max regards this as irritating but not serious, and at one point responds by saying that 'this game is getting old', to which sexybeast666 responds with 'this is not a game'.  Simon easily accesses Eric's message.  After watching cryptic video footage together, Max kicks out Simon to further research the matter alone.  Simon returns the next day and insists Max allow him to help, pointing out that his Vopo contacts could prove useful.  Max agrees, and they leave the city to visit the house of a woman seen in the footage, disguised as Vopo technicians.  The woman knows nothing, but in her house, Max and Simon find clues that lead them to a fellow computer hacker, Steven, who was working with Eric.  Overhearing from a Vopo security officer who has come to visit the house that Steven has died, they contact his girlfriend's sister, Grace, who works at a hospital.  Grace explains she has been searching for her missing sister.  She leads them to a safe house said to frequented by anti-Vopo hackers, though they find little information.  When a curfew passes, they hide from a Vopo patrol and crash at Grace's house.  There, the three get to know each other better.  Simon says he drifted apart from Eric once Eric began hanging out with computer hackers who opposed Vopo, and Max reveals that he met Eric at a juvenile detention center, where Eric taught him how to hack computers.  The others press Max to plays a tape, which they believe to be music; instead, it is a recording of his mother, who Max believes was killed by Vopo.  Simon dances with Grace, eventually telling her that Steven has died.  After they leave Grace's house, she dies after falling from a balcony - it is implied she took her own life (she takes a handful of pills just prior to her death).  Though shaken, they continue their investigation.  At work, Paul Bateson, the co-founder of Vopo, speaks to Simon.  He says he knows of Simon and Max's investigation, saying Simon reminds him of  himself and his idealistic partner, Tom, a talented computer hacker who, for reasons left unexplained by Bateson, is no longer with Vopo.  Urged by an anonymous computer hacker, Max and Simon uncover a hidden message left by Tom in which he expresses regret with how Vopo and the city have turned out, inviting anyone who can decode his message to join him searching out other surviving cities.  Later, while discussing this with Bateson, Bateson stresses the need for stability and safety over idealism.  Bateson reasons that even if any other settlements existed – which he discounts – they would only raid City Six if they knew of its success.  Simon and Max leave the city, violating a curfew by bluffing their way through a guard post via Simon's Vopo credentials and hacking Vopo's computer surveillance.  Outside the city, they find a wide desert.  Overjoyed by their newfound freedom, Max encourages Simon to leave City Six with him.  Simon reveals that he informed on Eric to save himself when Eric was sent to juvenile detention, and Max says he already knew this.  Max repeats his offer, but Simon declines, saying he has chosen to ally himself with Vopo.  He urges Max to flee from Vopo's security and says he will no longer be able to help him beyond this point.  As a drone approaches, Simon watches Max flee.  In the final scene, we see Max's empty apartment. Max's computer comes back to life and a screen message says a remote user is connecting (like when sexybeast666 used to connect). After connecting, the prompt on the screen is that of Max himself.  
Jai Ho Democracy
  First of all it is not a comedy movie. A freak incident in an Indian camp along the LoC triggers a war of words with their Pakistani counterparts on the other side of the no-man’s land. News of this standoff between the two camps gets leaked to a super-enthu news reporter and in no time, news spreads on national television that India and Pakistan are on the brink of a war.  This sensational disclosure, with no concrete evidence whatsoever, takes both the public and the government by surprise. The international bodies are alarmed, too. The Home Minister, in a bid to buy time, sets up a committee meeting to discuss the situation, submitting that they will decide whether India should go for war or not.  Chaired by an ex-Supreme Court Judge, the committee consists of members from the parliament, ex-servicemen and NGO workers. What follows is a series of hilarious events in the committee meeting, where the members, relying on silly excuses of so-called parliamentary rules and etiquette, go full throttle to tear each other apart. Within no time, the actual matter for discussion is lost in the chaos and they indulge in unbelievably petty and personal ego clashes. All this… even as the army, the government, the public and the world bodies wait with bated breath for their decisions. Till finally, the venue of the committee meeting turns into a battlefield, with the members going for each other’s throats.  The film takes a comic look at the way the powers-that-be love to procrastinate and maintain status quo, unfazed by the gravity of situations at hand. It explores the hilarity of the levels to which the media can go to sensationalize issues. It also gives a message of hope to peace through a glimpse of a Utopian possibility, albeit momentary, between the armies of the two neighboring nations.

The felon is Niyaaz Shaikh ([[Chandan Roy Sanyal]]) who is convicted for the rape and murder of a young woman named Sia ([[Priya Banerjee]]), and the case against him is set for judgement in four days. The kidnapper keeps track of Anuradha very closely to make sure that she complies with all demands.

The case against Niyaaz is being closely monitored by powerful politician Mahesh Maklai ([[Jackie Shroff]]). Mahesh asks renowned public prosecutor ([[Atul Kulkarni]]), who has been defeated by Anuradha in the past, to take up the case as rape is a critical issue the current government is fighting.

Da Peng tells them about the script he wrote, named ''"[[Jianbing|Jian Bing]] Man"'' (Pancake Man). The titular character is a superhero who fights against a large global crime organization that has kidnapped many people, including his beloved.

JeruZalem
 In 1972, two priests are called to record an event at Jerusalem. It is revealed that [[Jewish]], [[Muslim]], and [[Christian]] priests were all called to perform an exorcism on a woman who died three days before. Her son claims she was calm at first when she returned from the grave to his home, but became violent later, injuring her husband. After failed attempts to cure her, the priests decide they have no choice but to kill the woman. In a final attempt, the woman screams while sprouting leather wings, just before a priest kills her with a [[derringer]]. The narrator states that the strange events of 1972 were the "first proof" of a gateway to Hell in Jerusalem.    In the present, two Jewish American tourists, Rachel Klein (Yael Grobglas) and Sarah Pullman (Danielle Jadelyn), plan a vacation to [[Tel Aviv]]. Sarah's father gives her a [[Google Glass]], and the rest of the movie is taken from the Glass's [[POV shot|POV]]. On the plane, they meet a fellow American student named Kevin Reed (Yon Tumarkin). Kevin is fascinated by religious mythology, especially the Jinns  of Islam, the [[Golem]] of Jewish mythology, and the undead or [[zombie]]s, which he believes to all be manifestations of the same evil. He suggests that Rachel and Sarah join him on his journey to Jerusalem, and mentions that he wants to spend [[Yom Kippur]] there. Sarah becomes infatuated with Kevin and convinces her friend to go to Jerusalem. On their way to the hostel, they meet a local who believes that he is [[David|King David]]. The local warns them to leave the city because it's dangerous, warning that something terrible will happen on Yom Kippur, but the friends believe he is insane.   In the hostel they meet Omar (Tom Graziani) and his father Fauzi, who run the hostel. The local news channel reports of a murder that has taken place in the Old City with a massive amount of blood found on the street, but no body. While Rachel starts an affair with Omar, Kevin and Sarah grow closer. The four friends enjoy their time in Jerusalem, party, and tour the city. When Sarah gets lost in the Old City at night, she is frightened of an unearthly growling and screams she hears. Kevin shows Sarah a documentary he found on the internet with film footage of the 1972 exorcism.     When they visit the [[Western Wall]], Sarah wishes for her recently dead brother Joel to return. As soon as she [[Placing notes in the Western Wall|puts the paper into the Wall]], a swarm of black birds fly overhead. The four friends leave to tour [[Zedekiah's Cave|Solomon's Quarries]]. There, Kevin sees drawings of black angels on the wall, feels nervous, and leaves to research the drawings in the city's archives. While Sarah joins him, Rachel and Omar stay at the quarries. After investigating, Kevin warns Sarah to leave the city, because after this day "there won't be a tomorrow." Sarah also thinks that there is something strange going on, but Rachel refuses to leave.  Kevin insists on leaving, but Omar and his father believe that Kevin is [[Jerusalem syndrome|crazy]] and send him to a [[mental asylum]]. Later at night, Sarah witnesses Israeli military planes bomb parts of the city. The local media reports it as a potential terrorist attack and that the inhabitants should leave Jerusalem. Sarah tries to rescue Kevin from the asylum, but Rachel and Omar, being escorted by two Israeli soldiers, refuse to stop and insist that they keep moving. Sarah convinces the soldiers to help her free Kevin.  In the asylum, Sarah finds and frees Kevin. She also meets the man who claims to be King David, who reveals himself to be the son of the possessed woman who was killed in 1972. They manage to escape and meet Omar, his father, and Rachel at the city walls. However, the gates are closed and the city is under quarantine. Anyone who tries to leave is brutally shot down. The four friends don't want to give up on their escape, and Omar's father suggests sneaking out through underwater caves he knew as a child.  On their way there, they are met by demons who attack the civilians, biting and/or scratching to infect them as well as eat their flesh. Kevin believes that the doors to hell have somehow been opened and that the [[End time|End of Days]] has begun. Sarah soon realizes that Rachel has been infected as well when she is scratched by a demon. Kevin warns Sarah that Rachel's condition is contagious and that she will eventually change and attack them. However, Sarah convinces Kevin to take Rachel with them and have her see a doctor once they escape from the city.  In the caves, Rachel's condition worsens. Demons begin to attack the friends and Rachel transforms, her eyes turning black. Sarah falls down and Rachel regains control over herself, warning Sarah to run before killing herself. Sarah accidentally kills Omar's father with a sword taken from a statue, and when Omar realizes what happened, he commits suicide rather than being changed into a demon or be eaten alive by the creatures, leaving Kevin and Sarah alone. They meet a creature with white wings who turns out to be Sarah's brother Joel returned as an angel. Joel leads them from the caves. Upon reaching the other side of the wall, Sarah realizes that she has many scratches similar to Rachel's on her legs and arms. She turns into a demon and flies into the air, while Kevin looks on in horror.  In the final shot, thousands of demons are seen flying above Jerusalem as military helicopters surround the scene and fires burn throughout the city.<ref> Jeruzalem Movie</ref>

Jupiter Ascending
 Earth and countless other planets were established by families of [[transhuman]] and alien royalty for the purpose of later "harvesting" the resulting organisms to produce a type of [[youth serum]] for the elites on other planets. After the death of the [[matriarch]] of the House of Abrasax, the most powerful of the alien dynasties, her children, Balem, Kalique, and Titus, quarrel over the inheritance, with Balem inheriting an enormous refinery on Jupiter and Titus spending his inheritance on a lavish spaceship.  Jupiter Jones narrates that her father, Maximilian Jones, met her mother, Aleksa, in Saint Petersburg, Russia. After Maximilian is killed in a robbery, Aleksa names their daughter Jupiter, after his favorite planet, and they move to Chicago to live with Aleksa's family.  Many years later, Jupiter Jones cleans the homes of wealthy neighbors. To buy a telescope, Jupiter agrees to sell her [[egg cell]]s with the help of her cousin Vladie, under the name of her friend Katharine Dunlevy. At Katharine's house, Jupiter and Katharine are attacked by [[Grey alien|extraterrestrial 'Keepers']]; and when Jupiter photographs these, they erase both of their memories of the incident. Jupiter stumbles upon the strange photograph on her phone while waiting at an egg donation clinic, but cannot recall anything about it. During the procedure, the doctors and nurses are revealed to be Keepers sent to kill her, and she is saved by Caine Wise, a former soldier sent by Titus to bring her to him.  While Caine and Jupiter ascend to a ship, it is destroyed by a squad of Keepers who then attack them. Caine fends off the attack and manages to kill the Keepers and hijack one of their vehicles while protecting Jupiter. Afterwards, Caine realizes that Jupiter must be of great significance to both Titus and Balem, who is revealed to have sent the Keepers to Earth to capture her. He takes Jupiter to the hideout of Stinger Apini, another former soldier living in exile on Earth. As Jupiter discovers that she can control the bees in Stinger's residence, she is revealed to be galactic royalty. Stinger agrees to help Jupiter, but a group of hunters who initially were hired by Balem but bribed by Kalique capture her and take her to Kalique's palace on a distant planet, where Kalique explains that Jupiter is genetically identical to the dead matriarch, and therefore the Earth's rightful owner. Supported by Captain Diomika Tsing of the [[Aegis]] (an intergalactic police force), Caine retrieves her from Kalique, and takes her to the planet Ores (the intergalactic capital planet) to claim her inheritance.  In another attempt to lure Jupiter to him, Balem sends Greeghan to kidnap Jupiter's family. On the way back to Earth, Titus's henchmen capture Jupiter and detain Caine, as punishment for not bringing Jupiter to him as promised. Titus reveals to Caine his plan to marry and kill Jupiter and claim Earth. He then throws Caine into the void of space; he attempts to seduce Jupiter, declaring his intention to dismantle the youth serum trade, of which Earth is the next intended source.  Caine survives being spaced and returns with Stinger to save Jupiter at the altar before she completes the marriage contract. Jupiter asks to return home, but learns that her family has been taken hostage by Balem. In his refinery in the [[Great spot|Great Red Spot]], Balem demands Earth in exchange for Jupiter's family. Realizing that Balem can "harvest" Earth only with her permission, Jupiter refuses. Caine infiltrates the refinery and damages its gravity hull, causing the refinery to begin collapsing. While the occupants evacuate the refinery, Tsing's ship moves in and rescues Jupiter's family.  Jupiter survives the collapsing structures, only to land at the feet of Balem who tries to kill her; but she fights him off, and is rescued by Caine while Balem falls to his death. As the refinery is in its final stages of collapse, Tsing opens a portal to Earth and prepares to evacuate, potentially leaving Caine and Jupiter behind. However, she is relieved to find that they have survived and crossed the portal along with Tsing's ship. Jupiter's family is returned home with no memory of their disappearance, while Jupiter secretly retains ownership of the Earth. Caine's rank in the Legion is restored, and he and Jupiter begin a relationship.  
Joy (film)
 In 1990, [[Joy Mangano]] is a divorced mother of two, working as a booking clerk for [[Eastern Airlines]]. She lives with her two young children, her mother Terri, her grandmother Mimi, and her ex-husband Tony in working-class [[Peconic, New York]]. Her parents are divorced, and her mother and father fight whenever her father shows up at her home. Joy's older half-sister, Peggy, is an [[overachievement|overachiever]] who constantly humiliates Joy in front of her children for her failed marriage. Peggy and Joy's father Rudy are very close. Terri spends all day lying in bed watching [[soap opera]]s as a means of escape from her life, leaving Joy to run the household. Only Joy's grandmother and her best friend Jackie encourage her to pursue her inventing ambitions and become a strong successful woman.  After divorcing his third wife, Joy's father starts dating Trudy, a wealthy Italian widow with some business experience. While on Trudy's boat, Joy and her family drop their glasses of [[red wine]], and she attempts to mop up the mess.  While doing so, Joy cuts her hands on the broken glass while wringing the mop. Joy returns home and creates blueprints for a [[Joy Mangano#Miracle Mop|self-wringing mop]]. She builds a prototype with help from the employees at her father's shop. She then convinces Trudy to invest in the product. They make a deal with a company in [[California]], owned by a man in [[Dallas]], to manufacture the mop's parts at a low price. In order to avoid a potential lawsuit, Joy also pays $50,000 in royalties to a man in [[Hong Kong]] who supposedly has created a similar product. When the company repeatedly bills Joy for faulty parts they create, Joy refuses to pay the fees and tells her father, Trudy, and Peggy not to pay them.  Joy needs a quick, easy way to advertise her product, and is able to meet with [[QVC]] executive Neil Walker, with the help of Tony, who despite being divorced from Joy, remains close with her. Neil is impressed and shows Joy his infomercials, where celebrities sell entrepreneurs' products through a [[telethon]] system. Neil tells Joy to manufacture 50,000 mops. Joy is advised by Rudy and Trudy to take out a second mortgage on her home, in order to pay her costs. The first infomercial fails, due to the celebrity Neil chose to advertise the product having no clue how the mop works properly, but the next day she goes straight to QVC and convinces Neil to let her do the infomercial. Once the second infomercial is done, Joy and her product become an overnight success. Things look up for the family, with the mop earning thousands of dollars on QVC, and Terri falls for Toussaint, a [[Haiti]]an plumber Joy hired to fix a leak in Terri's bedroom, something Terri has not done since her divorce with Rudy and other than watching her soap operas.  Joy's grandmother dies suddenly, after the running success. Rudy and Trudy send Peggy to California to conduct Joy's company business. Afterwards Peggy tells Joy that she paid the excessively raised production fees, despite Joy telling them not to pay them. She now claims to Joy that she and Rudy have a product of their own to send to QVC which they believe will be better than Joy's. Joy is angry and travels to California to meet with the manufacturer, who refuses to pay her back. Joy discovers that the manufacturer is about to fraudulently patent her design and claim that they were the ones who originally created the mop. Trudy's lawyer reveals that there is nothing they can do to prevent this, since Peggy paid the excessive fees and Joy is forced to file for [[bankruptcy]]. Joy discovers that the manufacturers have been defrauding her the entire time she has dealt with them. Upon learning this, she travels to Dallas to confront the owner, Derek Markham.  She reveals to Markham that she made a call to the man she supposedly paid the royalties to in Hong Kong, to explain about the product, but that he told Joy that he had no knowledge of the mop being made or of any royalties being paid, proving that Markham and the manufacturing company are committing fraud and embezzlement, which forces Markham to pay Joy back. In the following scene, Joy is seen standing underneath a [[Snowmaker]] in Dallas, looking confident. She smiles, and slowly walks away, as [[Cream (band)|Cream's]] "[[I Feel Free]]" plays in the background.  Several years later, Joy is a wealthy, successful businessperson who helps other young inventors develop their ideas. Jackie and Tony remain her most valued advisors. Joy continues to take care of her father, despite him and Peggy having unsuccessfully and wrongly tried to sue her for ownership of her company. Terri is the only family member who does not live off Joy, finally finding stability through her relationship with Toussaint; and as Neil had predicted, he and Joy became "Adversaries in Commerce," with her move to HSN, but they remained personal friends.

Ju-On: The Final Curse
 Like previous films in the series, ''Ju-on: The Final Curse'' is told in an [[anachronistic]] order through eight vignettes titled after characters featured in the story. They are, in order: Mai (麻衣), Reo (玲央), Ena (絵菜), Madoka (まどか), Toshio (俊雄), Midori (碧), Sota (奏太), and Kayako (伽椰子). The synopsis presents a rough chronology of the film's plot.  Reo, a fatherless high school girl who lives with her mother, gets to live with her maternal cousin, [[Toshio Saeki]], who has recently lost his parents. Ever since Toshio moves into her house, strange things begin to happen, including hauntings by Toshio's mother, [[Kayako Saeki]], experienced by both Reo and her mother. Reo's friend, Midori, is disturbed after a creepy encounter with Toshio and decides to do a [[karaoke]] while mourning for her older sister, Yayoi, who went missing about a decade ago. Her karaoke screen distorts into a freakish image and when she returns from the restroom, Midori sees apparitions of Yayoi and a meowing Toshio. Yayoi then grabs Midori and kills her by throwing her upwards, making her head stuck in the ceiling. Reo's other friend, Madoka, searches about Toshio and finds the truth about the deaths of his parents, Reo's uncle [[Takeo Saeki|Takeo]], and Kayako. Just after she uploads the information to Reo, Madoka sees Toshio's ghost, who boils her from the inside.  Reo sneaks into Toshio's room and finds him motionless. When she is grabbed by another Toshio, Reo freaks out and falls down the stairs. She and her mother board themselves from Kayako, but the latter realizes that the ghosts will never let them go. She heads into the kitchen to arm herself with a knife and gets killed by Kayako. Swearing revenge, Reo heads upstairs with the knife and attempts to kill Toshio, but Kayako kills her by breaking her back.  Meanwhile, Mai Shono, a hotel staff member, is concerned about her younger sister, Yui, whom she had lost contact with since a year before. She meets apparitions of Yui who tells her that Toshio did this to her. Receiving Yui's belongings, Mai finds Yui's former teacher book and searches for Toshio's address but learns that the Saeki house has been demolished and barred from being built again by Kyosuke Takeda, who had lost his wife and sister-in-law to the curse. Mai asks Kyosuke for Reo's address but finds her house empty. Mai's boyfriend, the train station guard Sota Kitamura, questions Ena, a psychic girl living near Reo's house who had been recording Toshio's activities. Experiencing her telepathic visions, he goes to the house but is strangled by Toshio. Ending up killing him but survived, Sota becomes paranoid and is eventually killed by Kayako in his and Mai's apartment.  Deciding to end the curse, Mai arrives at Reo's house again and meets with the ghosts of Reo and her mother. They present the possessed Ena as Toshio. Seeing Toshio leaving Ena's body, Mai frantically tries to escape but is cornered by Kayako. Kayako suddenly changes into Yui, but at the last second, laughs at her sister and morphs back into Kayako, her mouth now cut and hanging wide open. The film ends with Toshio sitting at the kitchen and Mai whispering, "Help me."  
Jurassic World
  Teenaged brothers [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Zach_Mitchell|Zach]] and [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Gray_Mitchell|Gray Mitchell]] visit Jurassic World, a functioning dinosaur theme park and resort on [[Isla Nublar]], the original [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]] site, for [[winter]] [[School holiday|holiday]]. The trip is arranged by their mother for the boys to spend quality times with their aunt, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Claire_Dearing|Claire Dearing]], who is the park's operations manager, while their parents are in the middle of divorce. The boys are disappointed when Claire assigns her assistant, Zara, as their guide while she is busy, but the boys evade Zara to explore on their own.   Elsewhere on the island, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Owen_Grady|Owen Grady]], a [[United States Navy|Navy]] veteran, has been training the park's four ''[[Velociraptor]]s'', Charlie, Delta, Echo and Blue while also researching their intelligence. Based on the raptors' ability to follow commands, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Vic_Hoskins|Vic Hoskins]], the head of [[Jurassic Park#InGen|InGen]] Security, believes the animals can be weaponized, an idea Owen and his assistant, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Barry|Barry]], strongly oppose.   Prior to its opening, park owner [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Simon_Masrani|Simon Masrani]] and Claire inspect the park's newest attraction, the ''[[List of cloned animals in the Jurassic Park series#Indominus rex|Indominus rex]]'',  a [[Genetic engineering|genetically-engineered]] dinosaur created by geneticist [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr._Henry_Wu|Dr. Henry Wu]]. Claire has Owen evaluate the enclosure; they had previously gone on a date but it did not work out because of their differing lifestyles. Owen warns Claire that the ''Indominus'' lacks social skills from being raised in isolation, making it more dangerous and unpredictable. When it appears that the ''Indominus'' has escaped, Owen and two park workers enter the enclosure. Able to camouflage itself and [[Multi-spectral camouflage|mask its heat signature]], the ''Indominus'' suddenly appears. Owen survives the attack, but it kills the other two men before escaping into the island's interior. Owen tells Masrani to have the ''Indominus'' killed, but protecting his company's investment, Masrani instead dispatches a [[Private military company|specialized unit]] to subdue it with [[Non-lethal weapons|non-lethal weaponry]]. After most of the unit is wiped out, Claire orders the island's northern sector to be evacuated.  While exploring in a gyrosphere vehicle, Zach and Gray enter a restricted area. The ''Indominus'' arrives and destroys the sphere, but the boys get away. Finding the ruins of the original Jurassic Park visitor center, they repair an old [[Jeep Wrangler]] and drive back to the park resort. As Claire and Owen search for the boys, they barely escape the ''Indominus''. Masrani and two troopers hunt the ''Indominus'' by helicopter, but the ''Indominus'' breaks into the park's [[aviary]] to avoid the gunfire, releasing the [[pterosaur]]s ''[[Pteranodon]]'' and ''[[Dimorphodon]]'' that collide with the helicopter, causing it to crash and killing Masrani in the process. Gray and Zach find Owen and Claire at the park as armed personnel shoot down swarming pterosaurs with [[Sedative|tranquilizers]]. Zara is carried off by several pterosaurs before falling into the park's lagoon and being devoured by its ''[[Mosasaurus]]''.  Assuming command, Hoskins orders that the raptors be used to track the ''Indominus''; Owen, forced to comply, leads the raptors by motorcycle. Upon finding the ''Indominus'', the animals begin [[Animal communication|communicating]] with one another. Owen realizes that the ''Indominus'' has ''Velociraptor'' [[DNA]], and it becomes the pack's new [[Alpha (ethology)|alpha]], usurping Owen's dominance. The ''Indominus'' escapes as troops fire on it. The raptors wipe out most of the troops, but one raptor is killed. Hoskins has Wu and the dinosaur [[embryo]]s helicoptered off the island to protect Wu's research. Owen, Claire, and the boys discover Hoskins packing up the remaining embryos at the lab, but a raptor breaks in and kills him.  Outside, Owen re-establishes his bond with the three raptors before the ''Indominus'' reappears. The raptors attack the ''Indominus'', but two are killed. Claire releases the park's ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' and lures it into battle with the ''Indominus''. The latter gains the upper hand until Blue, the surviving raptor, joins the fight. Overwhelmed, the ''Indominus'' is cornered at the lagoon's edge, where it is dragged underwater by the park's ''Mosasaurus''. Isla Nublar is abandoned once again, and the survivors are evacuated. Zach and Gray are reunited with their parents; Owen and Claire become involved romantically.

Black Manta uses a craft disguised as a submarine to attack Atlantis using the stolen missiles to frame the humans. Batman and Superman locate Shin's home and his destroyed research. Superman finds a photograph of Curry and a letter revealing Arthur is half-Atlantean. Shin meets Arthur but he is killed by Atlantean soldiers sent by Black Manta. Arthur is blasted out of his collapsing house; Mera saves him and dispatches the soldiers using her water-controlling powers.   Citizens of Atlantis and Orm demand war following the attack on Atlantis, though Atlanna disagrees. Arthur wakes up with gills on his neck in underwater Atlantean ruins. Mera explains that Atlanna is his mother, though as a royal, Atlanna could not be with his father or Arthur. Now, Atlanna believes Arthur can help bridge the gap between the two worlds. Mera dresses him in the king's royal garb, though Arthur leaves wearing only the orange and green Atlantean bodysuit. They are attacked by [[The Trench (comics)|the Trench]] at the surface. The creatures overwhelm Arthur and the League helps defeat the Trenchers. Black Manta reports to Orm that the Trench failed to kill Arthur.   When Orm and Atlanna argue over starting a war, she reveals that she knows he attacked Atlantis. Orm stabs her to death from behind, and takes over as the new king of Atlantis. Arthur, Mera, Superman, Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern learn of Atlanna's death once in Atlantis. Orm (now using the mantle "Ocean Master") uses the trident to restrain the team in pods. The group is sent to be consumed by the monstrous Dark Trench, while Ocean Master leads Atlantis' army to the surface. Arthur taps into the power of the trident to destroy his pod, and with Superman's help, they save the rest and defeat the monster. A massive tidal wave conceals the Atlantean army's arrival in Metropolis. Superman saves [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|John Henry Irons]], and Wonder Woman saves [[Lois Lane]] and [[Jimmy Olsen]]. Black Manta attacks Arthur and reveals that he wants to overthrow Ocean Master to take Atlantis for himself. Arthur summons a [[shark]] to attack him.  Mera and the League battle Ocean Master, with little success.

Justice League: Gods and Monsters
 In an [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|alternate universe]], the [[Justice League]]Batman ([[Man-Bat|Dr. Kirk Langstrom]]), Wonder Woman ([[Bekka]]), and Superman ([[Chris Kent (comics)|Hernan Guerra]], son of [[General Zod]]) is a brutal force that maintains order on Earth. The lack of accountability for the League is challenged following the suspicious deaths of three scientists: [[Mr. Freeze|Victor Fries]]; [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]]; and [[Silas Stone]], along with his young son [[Cyborg (comics)|Victor Stone]]. When suspicion falls on the Justice League, President [[Amanda Waller]] asks that they cooperate with the government's investigation. Wonder Woman speaks to [[Steve Trevor]] to learn what the government knows while Superman invites [[Lois Lane]] to the Tower of the Justice, where he tells her of his goals to help humanity, and reveals how little he knows about [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] or his heritage.  Batman discovers an email sent to Silas Stone and a number of scientists, including Dr. [[Will Magnus]], Kirk's best friend who helped with his transformation. He asks Magnus, and his wife Tina, about "Project Fair Play", which involved all the scientists under [[Lex Luthor]]'s employ, but Magnus reveals nothing. The League locates the remaining scientists (consisting of [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|John Henry Irons]], [[T. O. Morrow|T.O. Morrow]], [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Michael Holt]], [[Pat Dugan]], [[Professor Hamilton|Emil Hamilton]], [[Bumblebee (comics)|Karen Beecher]], [[Doctor Sivana|Thaddeus Sivana]], [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Kimiyo Hoshi]], and [[Stephen Shin]]) who are meeting at a house. Just then, the remaining scientists are attacked by three robotic assassins who travel via [[Boom tube]]. Despite their efforts, the assassins leave Magnus as the sole survivor of the attack.  The League takes Magnus to the Tower to recover, while Superman flies to Lex Luthor's satellite orbiting the moon. Luthor reveals Project Fair Play is a weapons program to destroy the League if necessary. He also reveals he has the true information about Krypton, including Zod. As Superman leaves, a robotic assassin booms in and destroys the satellite, seemingly killing Luthor. Steve Trevor shows satellite footage of the explosion and Superman's presence to Waller, and she retaliates with Project Fair Play, which consists of troops and vehicles armed with energy weapons powered by red solar radiation like Krypton's sun.  Superman and Wonder Woman face the army while Batman stays inside the Tower, where he activates the forcefield, thinking Magnus can clear the League. Tina subdues Batman before shape-shifting into a liquid metal robot and revives Magnus with an organic nanite serum similar to Batman's, which physically enhances him and gives him regenerative healing powers. Magnus reveals he orchestrated the framing of the League, with his robotic assassins actually being the [[Metal Men]] armed with 'Boom Tube' technology and red sun energy. Magnus tells Batman he intends to detonate a Nanite Bomb, with microscopic Boom Tubes teleporting nanites into every person on the planet, to forcefully link humanity together into a [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]]. He confesses he killed the real Tina in a fit of rage and replaced her with a robotic duplicate named Platinum, capable of mimicking human flesh, and joined Fair Play, intending to use its resources to fund his secret Nanite Bomb project.  As Magnus prepares his weapon, Luthor, who escaped the explosion, teleports into the middle of the battle outside and tells everyone he has discovered Magnus' plan. Batman frees himself and seizes the opportunity to drop the forcefield. With Batman fighting Magnus, Wonder Woman faces Platinum, and Superman takes on the Metal Men, who quickly merge into a single, more powerful entity. Wonder Woman uses her sword's boom tube to send Platinum to the sun, while Superman destroys the Mother Boxes inside the Metal Men to keep them from 'Booming' before taking them underground and melting them inside molten rock. The League destroys the bomb (at the cost of Superman's Kryptonian escape craft) and, after being defeated by Batman, a remorseful Magnus commits suicide by disintegrating himself with nanites.  A week later, the Justice League has been cleared of all wrongdoing, and the world, along with Lois Lane, views them differently. Bekka decides to leave the Justice League to face her past along with Lex Luthor, who wants to explore other universes after growing bored with this one. Before leaving, Lex Luthor gives Superman all the data on Krypton and tells him to be a "real hero". The film ends with Superman and Batman deciding to use the data to help humanity.

Kabaddi Kabaddi
 Kabaddi gave a story of the unrequited love of Kaji (Dayahang Rai) for his soltini Maiya last year. As it was a good film with ample humour, the thoroughly entertaining film got all the love from the audience. One year has passed in Naurikot, Mustang and Kaji is back with Kabaddi Kabaddi. His love for Maiya has not changed, but Maiya is no different. She doesn’t reciprocate her feeling. She has a new admirer, Kaji’s rival—Bum Kaji. Both the Kajis compete with each other to win Maiya. The nearly two-hour-long entertaining journey unveils the winner.<ref>THE HIMALAYAN TIMES (2015). [https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/movie-review/laugh-riot-in-kabaddi-kabaddi-2/ ''Laugh riot in Kabaddi Kabaddi''] The Himalayan Times. N.P., 2015. Web. 28 Nov. 2015.</ref>  Kabaddi Kabaddi is the continued story of Kabaddi’s Kaji and Maiya. Retelling the same unrequited love story and romance of the two could have been dull but Rambabu Gurung has written the story brilliantly and articulately, and with intrigue and has directed with the same passion. As such the story has evolved along with the characters. The screenplay by director Gurung and Upendra Subba is also noteworthy.  The character of Bum Kaji, politics and sub-plots of Kaji’s two friends with tidbits of music and action have been mixed to the love story.  Also, the message of how politics works and how a husband and wife should be is nuanced.  However, there are a few things that don’t add up. Maiya is the same and hasn’t matured despite going through a lot in the first film. Bibek’s character (Nischal Basnet) again makes an appearance as Bum Kaji’s friend but their relationship hasn’t been explored to rest the curiosity of the audience. Perhaps, there is room for another Kabaddi film.  Kabaddi Kabaddi poster ''Maiya'' has less screen presence but has done fine as a chirpy village girl. Meanwhile, Bijay Baral and Buddhi Tamang, who play Kaji’s friends, have complemented the film.  Malla as Bum Kaji is the icing on the cake. The brilliant actor has pulled off his quirky character of a musician who is also a lover boy. He has shown great comic timing.  Nonetheless, the film’s USP is humour—right from the first scene where one of Kaji’s friends is writing a love letter for Kaji with blood (of chicken!) to Maiya while another friend roasts the same chicken with the beautiful backdrop of mountains till the end of the film. Humour is not just limited to dialogues and activities but expressions and demeanour. The take on humour is very natural and has the touch of everyday life which makes the scenes more relevant.

Mathimaran and his fellow policemen never get any cases as a result, much to his irritation.  Mathimaran falls in love with Divya ([[Sri Divya]]), who works as a nurse in a hospital, but hides his occupation from her as her family hates police officers. With her help, he finds out about an illegal organ donation racket orchestrated by Durai ([[Vijay Raaz]]), a politician, and Dr. Devasagayam ([[Yog Japee]]), who is the chairman of the hospital where Divya works.

Mathimaran first confronts Devasagayam, who commits suicide, but not before admitting his role in the scam and giving detailed information about it. He then decides to confront Durai and get him arrested, but the problem is there is not enough evidence against Durai except Devasagayam's word, and Devasagayam is dead. He tries to get more information about Durai's role in the scam incognito. Unfortunately, Durai soon finds out that Mathimaran is after him and a cat-and-mouse game begins between the two.

In the chaos that ensues, he shoots Durai in the leg and gives him the same treatment which had been meted out to the North Indian workers: administering him carbon monoxide and then harvesting his organs after he is declared brain dead. Durai's death is covered up as a terrorist attack. Mathimaran is eventually promoted to Inspector in reward for his efforts in thwarting the organ donation scam. He also gets accepted by Divya's family, despite being a police officer, and marries Divya.  
Kaay Raav Tumhi
 Kay Raav Tumhi revolves around three friends in their 60s and a young couple. The theme and the plot of the story carries the main crux of its treatment. It depicts the way how the things can change when one unexpected turn comes in between events, and how fantasies and plans come to an end in a totally satirical form.  It deals with [[Off-color humor|saucy humor]], and plots which change form according to the situation. The plot also shows how various literates of the society ([[landlord]], captain, doctor) plan events according to their fun and need, and how they fall prey to their own planning. The humor involved also has various [[Double entendre|double meanings]], saucy comments which are enjoyable only according to the situation.  The treatment is simple yet the situation confuses the characters, who from within are somewhat unaware of what is actually in store for them, and are mentally prepared according to their smartly made small fun cum plan, the events that occur in the life of the protagonists, and that keeps them unaware of the reality. As they slowly come to know the reality, and how they fall prey to their own plan, they realize but laugh it off.  They also pass somewhat weird comments at each other just to prove their own selves right, which in reality does  not happen and they have to accept the fact that some one else can also be much more smarter than them in  doing plannings and making them face the reality, where earlier they think that people around them are good but not the best, it then dawns upon them later that they are best than them too.  The story finally shows the mental state of the smarties when their lie comes to an end and they are caught in  a [[cat and mouse]] situation, where they feel awkward, funny, but great after all the ruckus comes to an end and  the confusing situation that was seeming to them as difficult to handle, also takes a clear and a happy turn, and then they realize the value of some who are actually true but only to set a right track for people like them  they timely turn their true self and not for any wrong intention, the satire of the whole story then takes a pleasing and a final turn.

Initially, Sarah refused to adapt to her grandfather's traditional cultural practice, such as eating [[Chicken feet#Chinese cuisine|chicken feet]] for breakfast, and the local community who she thought were disgusting. Despite the best efforts of her grandfather to re-create a familiar environment for Sarah by recreating western dishes that Sarah is familiar with using local substitutes, Sarah only ate [[Potato chip|chip]]s that she brought over from New York and refused to communicate with her grandfather.  Defeated, Sarah's grandfather turned to Ah Bao, a neighbour who claims to speak English, to translate his instructions in Chinese and Cantonese to Sarah. Annoyed but later amused at his poor command of English, Sarah starts to take an interest in the surrounding neighbourhood. She also reveals that she can actually understand and speak Chinese, much to her grandfather's relief. Slowly, she starts interacting with the children around the neighbourhood, who included her in their activities, and starts adapting to the local environment.

She disregarded his advice and ran away from home, never contacting him for decades while perusing a career as a fashion designer whilst balancing her role of a single mother after Sarah's father abandoned her.  Over time, the bond between Sarah and her grandfather deepened, despite occasional tension created by differences between her contemporary, [[social media]]-influenced lifestyle and her grandfather's conservative values. Sarah had warmed to the community so much that as the time draws closer to her departure, she became reluctant to leave. Above all, she did not want to leave her grandfather alone, as she had learnt of his various health ailments that he had hid from everyone over the years. Sarah thus prodded her grandfather to embrace new media so that she could communicate with him overseas and also tried desperately to get her mother and grandfather to reconcile.  Before Sarah's departure, Sarah's grandfather got Ah Bao to film a video to give to Sarah's mother when he dies. Inside, he apologized for not being a good father, his admiration for raising Sarah single-handedly as well as him bequeathing assets to her and Sarah. Ah Bao, defying his promise to keep the video secret, sends the touching video to Sarah's mother. Touched by his words, Sarah's mother hurriedly returns home and reconciles with her father after many years of estrangement.

When Patel notices Shanaya grooving to music with a band, he gets extremely upset and bawls at her, “When you have time to do all this, you have time for parties, you have time for your co-actor, why don’t you have the time for me? Have you ever asked me if I’m okay or not, even once?”Shanaya feels insulted and gets outraged, and packs her suitcase to leave his house. She explains, “If we were together, would you be able to adjust to the lifestyle of an actress. Would you be able to control yourself when people stare at me? No. Because you’re insecure. It takes a strong, secure man to marry an actress.” She leaves the house.  When Patel gets back from work, he is surprised to see a wedding is being arranged for him and he is groom. He is very confused and assumes he is about to get married to Shanaya. Shanaya gets that “Kenyan” woman and asks Patel to marry her.

With their bare hands, the boys are forced to perform the dangerous work by Rasmussen. They are warned not to expect any sympathy from the Danes, who resent their former occupiers. Rasmussen shares this contempt and he is determined to treat the young prisoners  without sympathy.  Rasmussen is rude to and contemptuous of them and the neighbouring household treats them with hostility. After marching his squad onto the dunes, he promises that they will return home in three months, if they can each defuse six mines per hour. Rasmussen begins to grow conflicted in his feelings and Sebastian Schumann, leader of the boys, attempts to remain optimistic; the boys discuss their plans for when they return home.  The POWs are not given food due to postwar shortages and some begin to suffer from [[malnourishment]]. The optimistic Wilhelm's arms are blown off and he dies in a [[field hospital]]. After stealing food from the nearby farm, the boys are poisoned by rat droppings and Rasmussen forces them to purge themselves with seawater. Afterwards, he begins to treat them more kindly, stealing food from the base for them and reporting that Wilhelm has survived, to maintain morale. He also allows the boys to use a device invented by Sebastian to improve productivity. While clearing the beach, one of the boys forgets to separate a mine's plunger from the detonator.  After Rasmussen stops a group of Allied soldiers from abusing one of the boys, he is accused of being overly sympathetic towards the Germans by Ebbe. Werner is blown to bits after encountering landmines buried one above another and his twin brother, Ernst, who is in [[denial]], is comforted by Rasmussen.  After a casual game of [[soccer|football]], Rasmussen's dog is blown up in a supposedly safe zone of the beach.  This causes Rasmussen to snap and begin abusing the boys again. He forces them to march together across the cleared zones of the beach to confirm that they are safe. He relents after seeing Ernst save a little girl from the minefield and then commit suicide by walking onto the uncleared sand.  He reassures a grieving Sebastian that they will soon be able to return. While four of the boys clear the beach of mines, a live landmine is accidentally tossed on a truckload of deactivated mines, killing the other seven. Only Sebastian, Ludwig, Helmut and Rodolf remain.  Although the boys had been promised that they would be sent home after defusing all of the mines, Ebbe informs Rasmussen that he has ordered the surviving four to be sent to another area, to join a team defusing landmines without the aid of a map. Rasmussen argues with Ebbe but he refuses to rescind the order. Rasmussen rescues them, drives them within 500 meters of the [[Denmark–Germany border|German border]] and orders them to run to their freedom.

Last Knights
 Bartok, an ageing nobleman, watches over his estate—a vassal kingdom to a great empire. Protecting the Bartok clan is Commander Raiden and his elite soldiers, who also serve Bartok. Raiden is surprised when Bartok tells him he is to be his heir, and gives him a sword. The empire has become corrupt and the evil minister, Geza Mott, humiliates Bartok by beating him with a stick for failing to provide an adequate bribe, until Bartok retaliates — which is treason against the crown. Bartok is put to trial where he speaks openly of his disdain for what honour has become in the empire. He is sentenced to death and Raiden is ordered to execute his own master. Bartok's estate is divided and the Bartok clan is disbanded. Geza Mott suspects Raiden will demand vengeance, and has his trusted warrior, Ito, watch Raiden to ensure there is no possibility of revenge.  A year passes and Raiden is now a drunk. Geza is still highly fearful of Raiden's wrath and demands half his father-in-law's troops to safeguard him while he completes construction of his newly fortified estate, with more soldiers than the emperor's own security detail. Raiden's wife, Naomi, couldn't bear to be with him as he had fallen so low, with Raiden even selling his sword for more drink. When Bartok's virgin daughter is offered to Raiden in a whorehouse, he shows no concern for her but leaves the premises. Geza finally lets his guard down and stops watching Raiden. It is now revealed that Raiden and the Bartok clan soldiers sacrificed everything for the illusion of a complete defeat, and have been waiting for the right time to group and together regain the clan's honour by avenging their master's death.  Raiden's men have been working in secret, building up contacts and connections, and gathering intelligence about Geza's estate - even secretly altering his estate to help them in their cause. As Raiden's men infiltrate the estate, Auguste has secretly made a pact with Raiden to help him, in exchange for Raiden's help to free his daughter from her marriage to Geza Mott. Geza has always mistreated Auguste's daughter which, along with Bartok's execution, causes Auguste to see that his vicious son-in-law has no honour. Raiden and his men successfully infiltrate Geza's estate, are discovered, and need to face a large number of soldiers.  Raiden's men fall one by one as they enter deep into Geza's estate. Ito takes responsibility for his complacency and duels with Raiden. Ito's sword fails and Raiden kills him. Raiden breaks into Geza's bedroom and decapitates him. With Geza dead, Raiden's surviving group rescues Bartok's daughter and tells her that Bartok's honour is restored. When word reaches the Emperor, he discusses with his council on how to deal with Bartok's soldiers, who caution him against the risk of turning the people against the crown. They realise that the public view Geza's death as a righteous one, and widely support the Bartok clan. The council advises that any judgment should restore their honour, rather than make them martyrs. Raiden asks that he be the only one executed for Geza's death.  The crown publicly admits the righteousness of the Bartok clan, but also reminds the crowd that killing a high council member is still the same as an attack on the emperor and Raiden is next to be executed for his defiance. Before his execution, Raiden charges Lt. Cortez to take control of the surviving Bartok clan. In a flashback, he sees Naomi one last time to apologize for her suffering before making peace with his own life. Raiden lowers his head with his eyes closed, and as the executioner draws his sword back, Raiden's eyes suddenly open wide and the screen goes to black.

The Last Witch Hunter
 Eight hundred years ago, the Witch Queen unleashed the [[Black Death|Black Plague]] to wipe out humanity. A band of knights, including a widowed Kaulder, whose family had died in the plague, storm her lair and in the ensuing battle, Kaulder manages to defeat her. Before dying, the Witch Queen cursed Kaulder with [[Immortality|eternal life]].  In the present day, Kaulder prevents a teenage witch from unintentionally destroying an airplane with weather controlling runes stored in her luggage. Kaulder is revealed to be working as a witch hunter for the Order of the Axe and Cross, an organization which aims to keep the truce between humans and witches (allowing witches to live freely providing they do not use magic on humans) and either executes or imprisons the witches who break the law. He is aided by a priest called "Dolan", a tradition carried from the first priest who fought in the battle to destroy the Witch Queen.  The 36th Dolan tells Kaulder that he is retiring from his duties and has chosen a new Dolan for him. The former apparently dies in his sleep that night. Kaulder and the 37th Dolan deduce that 36 was murdered by a witch. While tracking down the witch, Kaulder finds traces of old dark magic, not seen since before he killed the Queen. It is revealed that 36 is not dead but, rather, under a dark magic spell that can only be broken if the witch that cast it is killed.  Using clues that 36 left behind, Kaulder goes to a witch bar, owned by Chloe and Miranda, to buy a memory spell to help him remember how he died and came back. Chloe eventually agrees to perform the spell. During the process of reliving Kaulder's memory, the bar is attacked by a witch, the same one who cursed the 36th Dolan. He later attacks Chloe at her apartment, though Kaulder saves her by pulling her through a portal into his own apartment. Dolan the 37th and Kaulder work together to determine the hostile witch's name - Baltasar Ketola, though he goes by the name Belial. Shortly after, Kaulder convinces Chloe to try to make him another memory potion, but since Belial destroyed her stash at her club, she needs to visit Miranda's warehouse. After it is discovered that the plant they are there for hasn't sprouted yet and the rest stolen by Belial, Kaulder and Chloe discover Miranda's body as Belial taunts them through Chloe's phone. Chloe immediately agrees to help Kaulder get what he needs to kill Belial.  In order to get the rare ingredient to create another memory spell, they visit another witch, Danique. However, Danique casts an endless memory spell on Kaulder, planning to entrap him in his dream forever. Chloe, revealed to be a dream-walker, is able to enter his trance and free his mind and the pair escape. Kaulder asks Chloe to enter his mind and pull out the memory. He discovers that, though the Queen's body burned to ash, the first Dolan chose to spare the Queen's heart, having realised Kaulder's immortality is tied to the Queen's heart, which if destroyed, would cause Kaulder to die. They deduce that the 36th Dolan was attacked because he knew of where the heart was hidden and was tortured into revealing its location. They also realize that Belial's real plan is to revive the Queen.  Leaving Chloe and the 37th Dolan behind, Kaulder goes to face Belial and the Queen to prevent her from returning. Though he kills Belial in a confrontation, Belial had already revived the Queen, who then steals back Kaulder's [[immortality]]. The 36th Dolan, who is recovering, encourages Kaulder to continue fighting.  The members of the Witch Council, who guard the Witches' Prison, are killed and the Queen plans to release another plague curse using the imprisoned witches as a coven, since even the Witch Queen isn't powerful enough to cast it alone. Using her dream walking ability, Chloe manages to kill one of the weakest prisoners, severing the connection of the Queen to the prisoners and temporarily stalling her plan. Kaulder fights the Queen, and appears close to killing her, until the 37th Dolan attacks him, revealing he is the non-magical son of witches who Kaulder killed when he was five years old. He asks the Queen to give him magical powers. She states that despite her power, "clay cannot be turned to gold" and kills him, before turning to Chloe and linking her mind to complete the connections between the witches for the plague curse to form again. Kaulder manages to summon lightning to his sword (using the weather runes he confiscated from the young witch on the plane) and throws his sword into the Queen, burning her to ash. Kaulder prepares to kill both the Queen's heart and himself, but Chloe dissuades him, stating that there were things in the darkness worse than the Witch Queen that he needs to continue fighting.  The 36th Dolan agrees to delay his retirement and stay by Kaulder's side. Chloe does as well, and the three form a new team, free from the Axe and Cross. The heartbeat of the Queen is heard within Kaulder's weapon stash in his apartment.  
The Lazarus Effect (2015 film)
 Medical researchers Frank ([[Mark Duplass]]) and his fiancée, Zoe ([[Olivia Wilde]]), have developed a serum, code-named "[[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]]". It was intended to assist coma patients but is shown to actually be able to bring the dead back to life.  With the assistance of their friends, Niko ([[Donald Glover]]), Clay ([[Evan Peters]]),  and videographer Eva ([[Sarah Bolger]]), they run a successful trial on a recently deceased dog. However, they notice that the dog is behaving differently than it did when it was alive: its cataracts disappear, it loses its appetite, and it demonstrates other strange abilities. Tests reveal that the serum, instead of dissipating, is constructing strange new synapses within the dog’s brain.  When the dean of their university learns of their underground experiments, their project is shut down. They are also informed that a major pharmaceutical corporation has bought out the company that funded their research. The company and their attorneys confiscate everything associated with the project.  Frank and his team sneak back into their lab to duplicate the experiment so that they can prove that they created the serum. During this attempt, things go horribly wrong and Zoe is fatally electrocuted. Unwilling to let her go, Frank uses the serum to resurrect her. Initially, the procedure appears to be a success, but the team soon realizes that something is wrong with Zoe. She claims that when she died, she went to her version of [[Hell]], which was a nightmare originating from her childhood: during a fire in her apartment building, she witnessed trapped neighbors burning to death. She also begins to demonstrate unusual psychic abilities.  The serum causes brains to "evolve" incredibly rapidly, giving Zoe superhuman powers such as telekinesis and telepathy. It also causes increased aggression and insanity. Niko walks into a room and is surprised by Zoe. After he refuses to kiss her, she uses telekinesis to throw him into a locker and crush it with him inside, killing him. Using her new abilities, she cuts the power to the entire lab. When Clay demands to know where Niko is, she kills him as well by lodging an [[e-cigarette]] into his throat, resulting in him choking to death. Later, Zoe kills Frank after he attempts to inject her with poison. Zoe then injects herself with an entire bag of the serum, making her abilities stronger than before.  Eva, who is still alive and trying to locate Zoe to inject her, is left in the dark. Zoe eventually finds Eva and sends her into the Hell that she went to when she died. Inside the nightmare, it is revealed that Zoe was the one that caused the fire in the building, causing her to go to Hell upon death. Eva is able to escape and inject Zoe with the syringe, but that only happened in her mind and not reality; Zoe then kills Eva. Afterwards, she injects Frank with her own blood (which is saturated with the serum) in an attempt to bring him back from the dead, which successfully works for her.

Lazer Team
 [[File:RTX 2015 - Lazer Team suit (19823024694).jpg|thumb|right|180px|The suit of power on display]] In 1977, the government has secretly decoded a [[Wow signal|transmission]], sent by the alien Antareans, which warns of a deadly race known as the Worg, coming to destroy Earth. To help defend Earth, the Antareans have sent a powerful battle suit for the "Champion of Earth" to wear. The government begins training a boy named Adam from birth to be the Champion. Thirty-eight years later, Officer Anthony Hagan arrests Zachary "Zach" Spencer for causing trouble at a party and begins to drives him away, only to find Woodrow "Woody" Johnson and Herman Mendoza shooting unauthorized [[fireworks]]. Herman defiantly launches a massive rocket which strikes an incoming UFO and causes it to crash nearby.  The UFO opens to reveal the battle suit, and the four men each take a piece of it. The suit activates when all four pieces are worn, and each piece becomes irreversibly and genetically locked to its wearer. Zach discovers that his arm-cannon can shoot energy projectiles, Hagan's gauntlet can create an energy field, Woody's helmet increases his intelligence over time, and Herman's boots can make him run at superhuman speeds. The military shows up and apprehends the group. Angry that their preparations have been jeopardized and that Zach has posted a [[selfie]] with the suit (calling the four "Lazer Team"), Colonel Emory gives Adam orders to train them in only four days, after which time the Worg are scheduled to arrive. Meanwhile, a group of soldiers are possessed by small robotic insects sent by the Worg, and begin to hunt down Lazer Team and possess Mindy, Hagan's daughter.  The officers in charge decide to try and amputate the suit from the team, but when brought to the hospital, they escape using the suit's abilities. They are intercepted by Adam, but they work together to create a strong energy shield and knock him unconscious. After escaping, they hide out in Hagan's ex-wife's cabin. Zach calls the Worg-controlled Mindy on [[Skype]] and gives her his location. She arrives and attacks the group, but they subdue her and Woody communicates with the Worg through the device on the back of her neck. Before they can finish negotiating, Zach rips the device off and it self-destructs, destroying the cabin. They are then pursued by the possessed soldiers, but escape.  The team goes on their way to Zach and Mindy's high school, where they find out that an Antarean ship has landed over the town's football field, creating a giant forcefield around it. The Worg transmit a message, calling the Champions of Earth to battle. Lazer Team is once again ambushed by the possessed soldiers, but uses teamwork to kill all four of them. With the pressure of saving the planet weighing down on them, they all decide to hide except for Hagan, who turns himself in to the military. However, seeing the full potential in the team, Adam frees Hagan and they sneak to the stadium where a crowd has formed around the UFO. They find the rest of the team there and regroup. They hijack a police car and ram it into the forcefield, successfully reaching the football field.  The Worg warrior arrives in an identical suit of armor. Woody intercepts a transmission from the ship, revealing that rather than a war they are part of an [[elimination tournament]] where the Antareans destroy the losers' planets until one remains. Lazer Team proves unsuccessful at defeating the Worg by themselves, so Adam begins a distraction using riot gear from the police car. Adam is killed by the Worg with a dark matter beam, indirectly teaching the team how to achieve this with the suit. Lazer Team and the Worg fire dark matter beams into each other, creating a vortex. The four separated suit pieces malfunction and Lazer Team is blown clear of the forcefield, but the Worg and the Antarean ship are consumed. The team is greeted by a huge crowd outside. Emory arrives and states that the war isn't over, and that Lazer Team is going into space.  
Legend (2015 film)
 In the 1960s, Reggie Kray is a former boxer who has become an important part of the criminal underground in London.

Reggie uses threats to obtain the premature release of his brother, who is rapidly discharged from hospital. The two brothers unite their efforts to control a large part of London's criminal underworld. One of their first efforts is to muscle-in on the control of a local night club, using extortion and brutal violence.  Reggie enters into a relationship with Frances, the sister of his driver, and they ultimately marry; however, he is imprisoned for a previous criminal conviction, which he cannot evade. While Reggie is in prison, Ron's mental problems and violence lead to severe setbacks at the nightclub. The club is almost forced to close after Ron scares away most of the customers. When Reggie is finally released from prison, the two brothers have an all-out fist fight on the first night after Reggie's release, but they manage to partially patch things up.  The brothers are approached by [[Angelo Bruno]] of the [[Philadelphia crime family]] on behalf of [[Meyer Lansky]] and the [[American Mafia]], to try to interest them in a crime syndicate deal. Bruno agrees to a fifty-fifty deal with Reggie to split London's underground gambling profits in exchange for local protection from the Kray brothers. Initially, this system is highly lucrative for the Kray brothers. However, Ron barely concealed volatility results in him publicly murdering George Cornell, an associate of the [[The Richardson Gang|Torture Gang]], rivals of the Krays. [[Scotland Yard]], as a result, opens a full investigation of the Kray brothers.  Reggie beats and rapes Frances and she leaves him. Reggie then approaches her to start afresh offering her a holiday to [[Ibiza]]. However, she is soon found dead after committing suicide with an overdose of prescription drugs. The brothers' criminal activities continue and Ron pays petty criminal, [[Jack McVitie]] to kill Leslie Payne, Reggie's partner who controls the legal side of the Kray's operations. He only wounds Payne, who then turns the brothers over to Detective Superintendent [[Nipper Read|Leonard "Nipper" Read]], the head of the investigation. Reggie finds out and brutally stabs McVitie during a party hosted by Ron. The testimony given by Payne means that Ron is arrested and charged with Cornell's murder. The final scene shows a police squad breaking down the door to Reggie's flat in order to apprehend him for McVitie's murder.  The closing captions indicate both brothers receiving criminal convictions for murder. They died five years apart, Ron from a heart attack in 1995, and Reggie from cancer in 2000.

When Pepper asks a doctor if he has [[dwarfism]], the doctor tells him, "For now, Pepper, let's just say you're a 'little boy'," this expression would become Pepper's nickname. He would learn to despise those two words and always make a problem when someone would call out his nickname.  However, when [[World War II]] begins, Pepper's older brother is declared ineligible for military service because of [[flat feet]] and his father joins in his place, which devastates Pepper.<ref></ref> Not long after his father leaves for war, Pepper hears the Bible verse, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move" (Matthew 17:20), he becomes determined to get enough faith to bring his father home.  Nevertheless, as his friend and mentor Father Oliver tells him, faith is useless to anyone who harbors hatred. Father Oliver tells Pepper to befriend a Japanese man named Hashimoto.  At first, the [[anti-Japanese sentiment]] Pepper has internalized - which has become prevalent in his society - makes him hesitant to follow this advice, but as he gets to know Hashimoto, he begins to value their friendship and learns from Hashimoto to stand up to those who bully him about his height.

Later that day, a spokesperson from the Army arrives to tell her that her husband didn't die after all. The man that actually died had stolen Pepper's father's boots, with his dog tags attached to the laces, when he fell after being shot, so he was misidentified as Pepper's father.

The Little Prince (2015 film)
 An ambitious young mother imposes a [[Coaching|life plan]] for her daughter that leaves no time for leisure, all for her to enroll in the prestigious Werth Academy. The girl, however, becomes distracted by her elderly retired aviator neighbor, who tells her the story of the "Little Prince", claiming that he encountered him in the [[Sahara]] after crash-landing there. The aviator recounts the Little Prince asking him to draw a sheep. Lacking skill, he drew a box instead, explaining that a sheep was inside, satisfying the Little Prince.  The girl and the aviator continue to read and play together without the mother's knowledge. The aviator tells the girl about the Little Prince's home, "[[Asteroid]] B612", covered in [[Adansonia|baobab sprouts]]. He states that after clearing away the sprouts, the Little Prince found and nurtured a [[Rose]] into maturity. Despite becoming his friend, she was rather selfish, which caused the Little Prince to travel to elsewhere with a flock of birds. After meeting some adults on other asteroids, he eventually landed on Earth, meeting and taming a [[red fox]]. After a while, the fox bid goodbye to the Little Prince, advising him to always see with his heart. The aviator gives the girl a [[Stuffed toy|stuffed]] fox as a gift, telling her that he will leave soon to go find the prince.  The two decide to go out for free "birthday" pancakes; when pulled over by a police officer, the aviator is revealed to have no [[Driver's license|license]] and the officer returns the girl home. Realizing that she has not been following the plan, her mother redoubles her daughter's assignments. Nevertheless, the girl continues to read the story of the Little Prince, secretly visiting the aviator to find out the story's ending. The aviator tells her that the Little Prince had succumbed to a [[venomous snake]] bite in order to be reunited with his beloved Rose. Although the aviator assures the girl that he firmly believes the Little Prince succeeded, she is so upset by the dark twist to the story that she wishes she had never met the aviator or heard the story.  Towards the summer's end, the aviator is hospitalized. Wanting to put things right, the girl sets off in search of the Little Prince. Escaping through the gutter, the girl falls into the aviator's yard and blacks out. After she awakens, the girl, accompanied by her now-conscious stuffed fox and the Little Prince's story pages, flies the aviator's plane into space. They find all the stars mysteriously gone, all the while landing on an asteroid populated by workaholic adults owned by the "Businessman" from the Little Prince’s story, who captures and holds all the stars to power his asteroid and belongings. After encountering a police officer and an [[elevator operator]] – the "Conceited Man" and "the King" from the story – they finally find the Little Prince, who has become an adult named "Mr. Prince" and works as a janitor for the businessman, having no recollection of his past.  Mr. Prince accordingly takes the girl to an "academy" where she is to be "reconditioned" as an adult by a machine by a tall, slim, sinister Teacher. Recognizing the sheep's box from the book's pages (due to his amnesia, he believe that it might be important), Mr. Prince recovers his memories and saves the girl from the same fate that he had. They escape together and liberate of all of the stars from the Businessman's glass vault, which return to their rightful place in the sky. The girl and the fox then take Mr. Prince back to B612, which is overgrown with baobabs. They find the Rose dead, but seeing her image in the sunrise, the baobabs disappear and Mr. Prince turns back to his younger self, giving him renewed hope.  The girl and the fox return home, accompanied by another flock of birds. The next morning, the girl and her mother visit the aviator in the hospital. The girl presents him the formerly loose pages bound together as a book, along with all the formerly missing parts filled in.

The Lobster
  David ([[Colin Farrell]]) is escorted to a hotel after his wife has left him for another man. The hotel manager reveals that single people have 45 days to find a partner, or they will be transformed into an animal; the dog accompanying David is his brother. David chooses to become a lobster, due to their life cycle and his love of the sea. David makes acquaintances with Robert, a man with a lisp, and John, a man with a limp, who become his quasi-friends. John explains that he was injured in an attempt to reconnect with his mother, who had been transformed into a wolf.  The hotel has many rules and rituals: [[masturbation]] is banned, but [[sexual stimulation]] by the hotel [[maid]] is mandatory, and guests attend dances and watch [[propaganda]] extolling advantages of partnership.  Robert is caught masturbating, and the hotel manager burns his fingers in a toaster. Relationships require partners to have a distinguishing trait in common. John is told a woman has arrived with a limp, but he says she limps from an injury that will heal and is not a suitable match.  Residents can extend their deadline by hunting and tranquilizing the single people who live in the forest; each captured "loner" earns them a day. On one hunt, a woman with a fondness for biscuits offers David sexual favours, which he declines. She tells him that if she fails to find a mate, she will kill herself by jumping from a hotel window.  John then wins the affections of a woman with constant nosebleeds by purposely smashing his nose in secret. They move to the couples section to begin a month-long trial partnership. David later decides to court a notoriously cruel woman who has tranquilized more loners than anyone else. Their initial conversation is interrupted by the screams of the biscuit-loving woman, who has severely injured herself jumping from a window. Although troubled by the incident, David pretends to enjoy the woman's suffering to gain the heartless woman's interest. He later joins her in a jacuzzi, and she begins choking; when he does not attempt help, she decides they are a match. The two are shifted to the couples' suite. When David wakes up one morning, he finds she has kicked David's brother (in dog form) to death. When David cries in response, she concludes their relationship is a lie and drags him to the hotel manager to have him punished by turning him into an animal that no one likes. However, he escapes and, with the help of a sympathetic maid, tranquilizes and transforms his partner into an unspecified animal.  Escaping the hotel, David joins the loners in the woods. In contrast to the hotel's rules, they forbid any romance, with mutilation as punishment. The hotel maid is a mole for the loners, planted in the hotel to sabotage it. The leader of the loners ([[Léa Seydoux]]) takes loners to visit the city to get some supplies.  The loners launch a mini-raid to sabotage the hotel's work. David reveals to the nosebleed woman that John has been faking. John forces David to leave. Other loners hold the hotel manager and her husband at gunpoint, tricking him into shooting his wife to save himself, but the gun is not loaded, leaving the couple to face each other.  Soon David, who is [[Near-sightedness|shortsighted]], begins a secret relationship with a shortsighted woman ([[Rachel Weisz]]). They develop a gestural code for communication. They plan to escape together, but the mole who is now with the camp finds the shortsighted woman's journal and discovers her plan to escape with David. She takes the woman to the city, ostensibly to have an operation to cure her shortsightedness, but blinds her instead. In anger, the woman kills the hotel maid, thinking she is killing the leader.  She tells David about her blindness. They try to find something else they have in common, to no avail. He says they'll figure it out, and tells her to continue with their plan. Early the next morning, David overpowers and ties up the leader, leaving her in what appears to be his grave. He and the blind woman escape to the city, stopping at a restaurant. Seeking to reestablish sameness, David goes to the restroom and prepares to blind himself with a steak knife. The now blind woman waits at the table for him to return as the waiter tends to her.

The Lives We Lead
 Chronicles the lives of four friends, whose lives are consumed by the unfair attitudes and values imposed upon them as children. The Lives We Lead spans over 50 years, following these distinct characters from childhood to old age, as they grapple with the effects of their very different attitudes towards life, love and fulfillment as circumstance and the actions of others influence their decisions and shape their futures.  The film opens with the assembly of a photo album and transitions to a playground and introduces the characters as children, each developing their personalities amid their strained family dynamics.  Pamela and Edith are two competitive sisters who enjoy taunting each other. Their widower father dotes on Pamela for her confidence and extroverted personality, often shaming Edith for being more introverted and studious. This results in Pamela developing a narcissistic [[Cinderella complex]], while Edith rebels amid strong feelings of inadequacy.  Gavin, the new kid, comes from a very well-to-do family and is amply provided for, but his parents communicate through barbed [[Passive-aggressive behavior|passive aggression]] and all but overlook Gavin, their only child. He is to be seen, not heard. Later when his [[homosexuality]] is established and his mother runs off to seek her own happiness, Gavin's father rejects him as the greatest disappointment he has ever known, citing his friends the root of Gavin's outspoken need for belonging.  Kerrod, another local boy, is the third of three boys from a working class family, living adjacent to Pamela and Edith. He is taught to be a provider and a hardworking tradesman.  Upon graduating high school, Pamela and Kerrod are shown to be dating. She is pursuing acting and he has an electrician apprenticeship. 16-year-old Edith has become a rebellious aspiring writer, possessing a distinctly bitter world view, while Gavin is shown attending a gay social event at which he meets Michael, a talent agent.  Gavin and Edith make a pact to be one another's companion safety net, should they be unlucky in love. Edith rejects Gavin's suggestion of someday seeking IVF together; refusing to sacrifice her dream career for family or the needs of others.  Coincidentally, Kerrod and Pamela unexpectedly fall pregnant. The fierce backlash is quickly overshadowed by the sudden death of Kerrod's father, closely followed by their [[shotgun wedding]]. Pamela visits a palm reader who points out that she does not appear to have a life purpose. Pamela storms away, infuriated.  Gavin's relationship with Michael turns sour and he stays with Kerrod and Pamela, who is struggling with [[postpartum depression]]. Edith's writing career takes off, freeing her from the obligation to her father and the rest of her family. Gavin and Pamela both attend a spiritual retreat, from which they both return to their former lives with a stronger sense of self. Pamela cites time being the main struggle in her life and resolves to live her life to the fullest while she is still young; Gavin cites men as his greatest weakness and promptly returns to Michael for one more try at their relationship.  Two years later, at the birthday party of Kerrod and Pamela's son, Gavin drunkenly kisses them both and Edith defuses the situation by taking him to a private room in the house. Overwhelmed by a sudden rush of inadequacy and jealousy, Edith sexually assaults Gavin and falls pregnant to him.  In a moment of [[deja vu]], the news of Edith's pregnancy coincides with the death of her own father. Stranger still, Pamela also announces she is expecting again. Gavin attempts to mend ties with his father, but is rejected once more. Edith, conflicted with exactly why she wants to have child in the first place, has a chance meeting with a respected publisher and is given a great career opportunity. Her subsequent decision to have an abortion effectively breaks Gavin's heart and their friendship is terminated.  Six years later, Pamela's sense of purpose has begun to wane in the shadow of Edith's success and her marriage to Kerrod begins to fracture under the stress of parenthood. Through a montage, seen primarily from Pamela's point of view, the extent of their financial difficulties is made apparent, as is Pamela's shame at not achieving with her life as she had wanted, made worse still by Edith's ability to lift the family out of debt.  On their 15th anniversary, Kerrod shoves Pamela during another quarrel. Overcome with guilt, Kerrod retreats to Gavin's house. He is distressed and inebriated upon arrival and Michael encourages Kerrod to pursue his own happiness but also indecently assaults him. Kerrod violently defends himself and Gavin breaks up with Michael and leaves with Kerrod.  Struggling with her marriage breakdown, Pamela indulges in some casual sexual encounters before the next leap in time.  Over the next 20 years, Kerrod raises his sons on a country property far away from Pamela. Gavin was there with him for a while but eventually found a new outlet for his acting career, which becomes wildly successful and he moves to the [[United Kingdom]]. He is seen calling his father to postpone some social plans, but mentions his new partner and his appreciation at how his parents are working out their differences. Gavin's parents are then seen, well into their 80s or 90s, tenderly holding hands.  Kerrod suffers a heart attack and his acute condition reunites Pamela, who is now a B-grade thespian and cabaret performer, with Edith, a successful best-selling author. Gavin is unable to make it back to Kerrod before he dies, but both Pamela and Edith are able to bury the hatchet with each other at his funeral. They agree that their naivete and [[sibling rivalry]] were the root of their poor life choices but also that there is ultimately nothing to forgive. Edith graciously soothes Pamela's bitterness over the sense that her life is without purpose, explaining that this means she can do whatever she wants with her life. She speaks philosophically about wisdom and regrets and the two feuding sisters are able to find peace together.  Many years later, Gavin and Edith have passed away and Pamela reflects on her long and family-oriented life. She sits alone and wistful, closing a photo album and shedding a tear, before we dissolve to a view of the playground at sunset and a clock pointing sharply at 12.

When they open the casket, they discover the gold is missing.  Around the same time, Jayanthi ([[Andrea Jeremiah]]) arrives in Kochi from Mumbai in search of her missing husband, Ramesh ([[Ashvin Mathew]]), an [[Indian Revenue Service]] officer who frequently disappeared from home for various reasons, but is now a suspect in the gold smuggling. Jayanthi arranged for a taxi to drive her to various locations in her quest to find Ramesh. The taxi driver Raju ([[Mohanlal]]) appears to have an interest of his own in the circumstances surrounding Ramesh's disappearance. At Jayanthi's bidding, Raju drives her to the home of her mother-in-law ([[K. P. A. C. Lalitha|KPAC Lalitha]]) where he cooks for them and interacts in such a way to earn their trust. Jayanthi then asks Raju to drive her to Kochi to the office of her friend, Chandrasekharan ([[Vijayaraghavan (actor)|Vijayaraghavan]]), assistant commissioner of police. Chandrasekharan promises Jayanthi he will investigate the disappearance of Ramesh. After leaving Chandrasekharan's office, Raju drives Jayanthi to see Chandrasekharan's wife, Advocate Rekha (Muthumany), who is also her friend. During their chat, Jayanthi receives a surprise phone call from Ramesh. He explains that he is in Kovalam for an official meeting but will return home the next day, and insists that Jayanthi return home as well. Chandrasekharan later informs Jayanthi that the phone number Ramesh called from was actually in Kochi, not Kovalam. It is also revealed that Sudheer, Ramesh's brother is involved in the smuggling operation.  Meanwhile, Unni, Babu, Shaji, Shenoy, and MLA meet atop an apartment building to discuss the circumstances surrounding the gold they smuggled into Kozhikode and lost to an ambush while in transit from the airport. They suspect Ramesh is involved since he disappeared right after the incident. They devise a plan to kidnap Jayanthi in order to force Ramesh to return the gold. An unsuspecting Raju and Jayanthi become the targets of their surprise attack in which Jayanthi is rendered unconscious. Raju draws his concealed handgun and foils the kidnapping by shooting at his assailants. He collects the unconscious Jayanthi and transports her to a safe place. When she awakens, she finds herself surrounded by strangers. She also discovers that Raju is not just a taxi driver rather he is part of an investigation to find Ramesh and the missing gold. Raju explains to her that Ramesh was involved in the smuggling, and has since become the target of the criminals. Jayanthi returns to Rekha's home for safety, and Chandrasekharan begins investigating Raju who, in a turn of events, has raised suspicion.  Raju and his team, now disguised as [[Sabarimala]] pilgrims, rent a van hoping to catch Jayan. Raju's teammate, Ameer Amanulla ([[Abu Salim (actor)|Abu Salim]]), pretends to be an informer for Arif Bhai ([[Joy Mathew]]). He lures Jayan into a trap by telling him a gift from Arif is waiting for him in the van. Jayan is captured and interrogated by Raju who questions the 30,000 Dirham Jayan received from Arif in Dubai, as well as the circumstances surrounding the death of Rafeeq. Jayan reveals that Rafeeq was purposely pushed off a building to his death as part of Arif's master plan to transport the gold, thinking no one would suspect the gold was hidden in his casket. The trail leads Raju to the home of Ramesh's parents where Ramesh has been hiding under the protection of his mother, who is also aware of the smuggling. Raju takes Ramesh into custody along with others involved in the crime but he lets Ramesh go. It is eventually revealed that co-smuggler Shaji ([[Suresh Krishna (actor)|Suresh Krishna]]), a young politician had deceived Unni and took the gold for himself.  After Raju and his team retrieve the gold, they are detained by local police. Raju identifies himself as a [[Research and Analysis Wing|RAW]] agent and his team as intelligence officers from various agencies of India. He discloses his real name as Rajeev Sathyamoorthy. The police release them so they can complete their investigation and allows them to go back to Mumbai. Near the end of the film, it is revealed that Raju and his team are the actual smugglers.

Loev (film)
 Sahil (Ganesh), a young Mumbai-based musician, plans a weekend getaway to the [[Western Ghats]] with his childhood friend, Jai (Pandit), a successful New York-based businessman. The trip coincides with the latter's business meeting in Mumbai. The duo drive to [[Mahabaleshwar]] overnight and upon arrival decide to visit the local market. While at a [[music store]], Jai is impressed by Sahil's skill as a guitarist and suggests that he pursue a career as a full-time musician.  Throughout their trip, they argue about their past failure to maintain a relationship. Sahil is irked by Jai's increasingly indifferent behaviour and his workaholic nature. Jai, on the other hand, is disgruntled with Sahil's continuous complaints. One night, Jai makes a pass at Sahil, who is initially hesitant but eventually responds to his advances. The next morning, the two visit the Ghats as Sahil had intended. Sahil takes Jai to an overhanging cliff, with a scenic view of Mahabaleshwar, where the two kiss. They later return to a hotel in Mumbai for Jai's scheduled business meeting. At the hotel room, the two admit to their mutual attraction, just before Jai has to leave for his meeting. Sahil interrupts the meeting and embarrasses the businessman with a romantic gesture witnessed by everyone present. This leads to a confrontation between the two back in the hotel room, during which Sahil accuses Jai of being scared of [[coming out]]. Jai counters by blaming Sahil for not reciprocating his affection from the beginning. The two kiss, but when Sahil tries to pull away, Jai rapes him, only to immediately regret it. Jai apologises and tells Sahil that he need not stay any longer if he doesn't want to. Sahil stays, but refrains from conversing with Jai.  As planned, the two meet Alex (Menon), Sahil's boyfriend, who is accompanied by a friend, Junior (Chaddha). The group discuss their lives over supper, which is cut short by an argument between Alex and Sahil over the former's irresponsible behaviour. The four head back to the hotel room to collect Sahil's belongings, as Jai plans to return to New York later that night. Alex notices the guitar and insists that Sahil play for him; Sahil obliges with an original song. Alex dances with Jai, who is completely smitten by Sahil by this point. Alex offers to take back Sahil's belongings and give the two some more time together. When he leaves, Sahil and Jai embrace, but do not talk about the rape.  At the airport, Jai is overwhelmed with guilt and asks Sahil to leave. He rejects Sahil's efforts at reconciliation, and tells the musician that they can never be together because they have vastly different lives. When they eventually part ways, Jai sends a text message to Sahil saying that he loves him. Alex arrives at the airport to pick Sahil up, much to his surprise. He tries to make up for his mistakes by offering Sahil a heartfelt apology as the two drive back to their apartment.  
The Longest Ride (film)
 Luke Collins ([[Scott Eastwood]]) is a bull rider on the [[Professional Bull Riders]] (PBR) tour, who is seriously injured one night while performing. A year later after recovering, he starts riding again and meets Sophia Danko ([[Britt Robertson]]) after she attends the show. She is an art lover living at a sorority house with an internship secured in New York City. On the way home from their first date, they spot a car crash in the woods and help rescue an older man who is stuck inside. Sophia also pulls a wicker box from the vehicle.  While in the hospital, Sophia continuously visits the 91-year old man she and Luke rescued, Ira Levinson ([[Alan Alda]]). He explains that there are letters in the box, which he wrote as a teenager, and she offers to read them to him. They tell the story of how he met his late wife, Ruth ([[Oona Chaplin]]), on April 10, 1940. Their stories start to interweave. Luke finds an old photograph of Ira and Ruth that fell out of the box in his car and takes it to him at the hospital. In flashbacks, Ruth tells a young Ira that she wants a big family and, eventually, he proposes to her before leaving to fight in World War II. However, Ira is shot during an attack and is later informed by the doctor that he can no longer have children, news that causes distance between him and Ruth when he returns; as he knows how much she wants to be a mother. They decide to make it work regardless and move in together, decorating the house with many paintings that he and Ruth love more than anything.  Luke continues riding bulls, no matter the risk of being hurt again, while he and Sophia fall in love. Ira is now out of the hospital and has been moved to a nursing home, where Sophia continues to visit. She gets a call from her boss in New York asking her to attend an art exhibit in Charlotte the following week, which she invites Luke to. While they're there, Luke makes a rude comment to Sophia's boss, which causes an argument between them. They talk about how their worlds are so different and Luke doesn't feel that their romance will work out because of it. Back home, Sophia goes to Ira for advice. He then tells the story of how they made their situation work. Ruth was a school teacher who became very attached to a young boy named Daniel McDonald in her class. Because Daniel lives with his uncaring half-brother and his wife, she and Ira begin taking him in as their own and Ruth later decides to officially adopt him as her son, but his hardhearted relatives wouldn't allow it.  Meanwhile, Luke injures himself again, causing him to be rushed to the hospital. As Sophia is leaving for New York, she gets a call and goes to see him. Luke is advised not to ride again but refuses to accept that his career is over. Following an argument, Luke and Sophia break up. In flashbacks, Ira and Ruth also break up because she can't see a life with him without children in their future. However, weeks later, Ruth returns and they confess their love for one another. One morning, now eighty years old, Ira wakes up to find Ruth has died in her sleep. He boxes up all of the paintings they collected together to sell them at an auction. One night, a woman knocks on his door claiming to be the wife of Daniel McDonald, the child they almost adopted when they were younger, to inform him that Daniel, who later became an astronomer in Britain, has died. She gives him a portrait of Ruth that Daniel had painted and the photograph Daniel had kept of Ira and Ruth (the one Luke found in his car the day of the crash) with a message on the back that reads: "Ruth Levinson, third grade teacher. She told me I could be anything I wanted to be when I grew up". Daniel became a professor of astronomy in memory of his favorite teacher.  Sophia continues her studies at Wake Forest and Luke continues to ride bulls. One day, they are both contacted by Ira's attorney, Sophia receiving a phone call while in class and Luke opening a registered letter after a difficult ride, to inform them that Ira has died and that there will be an auction held for the paintings in his collection. Luke wins his last ride and wins the championship bull cup, but feels disappointed because Sophia isn't there to share it with him. He then decides to go to the auction, where he somewhat unexpectedly meets Sophia.   Luke buys the first painting, Daniel's childhood "Portrait of Ruth". Unlike the other paintings and pieces that are on the scheduled auction list, this first painting is not a professional work and is only in the auction - and listed first - because of Ira's love for her, and his specific instructions that this painting be sold first. Luke makes the only bid, getting it for only $600.00. Most of the other art is assumed to be far more valuable and will probably go for far more money, and as this is the only painting Luke can afford, he bids on it out of his love and affection for both Ira and Sophia only after no one else bothers to bid on this "amateur" work of art.   As Luke goes to the back to pay the auctioneer, Sophia and Luke talk and he tells her he won't ride anymore because what he really wants is to be with her for the rest of his life. As they reconcile with a kiss, an uproar breaks out in the auction room. The auctioneer announces that there is a codicil in Ira's will regarding the auction. First ensuring that Luke has paid for the painting of Ruth and checking the receipt, he reads the codicil which simply states that "sharing these paintings was the greatest joy of my life....and the true gift was the journey of love and life we shared together. Portrait of Ruth may not be the most valuable painting in my collection, but it was the most precious to me because it reminded me daily of my beloved Ruth. And so, the terms of my will are simple; whoever purchases her portrait will receive my collection in its entirety" <ref>''The Longest Ride'' script https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/movie_script.php?movie=the-longest-ride </ref>. Luke becomes owner of the entire collection, worth almost $200 million. He and Sophia now hold together the trust of love that binds all of Ira's paintings together.   One year later, Luke and Sophia, now married, have built a museum dedicated to Ira and Ruth and their paintings. Luke takes Sophia to the [[Black Mountain College|old college]] where Ira and Ruth used to spend their wedding anniversary. They sit under exactly the same tree and read Ira's letters together.  
Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run
  From his headquarters, [[National Security Agency|NSA]] General [[Foghorn Leghorn]], his intern [[Pete Puma]], and spy [[Cecil Turtle]] oversee an operation on a mountain in the central [[Mexico|Mexican]] jungle. The objective of the operation is to extract a rare flower, as the agents believe it to be the world's most powerful weapon. However, they are beaten to it by [[Speedy Gonzales]].  In [[New York City]], [[Lola Bunny]] is tired of working for [[Long-Haired Hare|Giovanni Jones]] at the [[Acme Corporation|Acme]] department store perfume counter. She accidentally damages the store, gets fired and takes a long, awkward ride home in [[Bugs Bunny]]'s taxi. Arriving in her apartment, she screams when she sees a mouse, even though it's her landlord, Speedy. He gives her the flower as a gift, unaware it is being watched by the NSA.  Foghorn sends agent [[Elmer Fudd]] to watch the flower, though Lola uses it to create her perfume, which has a side effect of invisibility. She doesn't notice as she accidentally sprays her eye, forcing her to wash it out, rendering her visible. Cecil sends his goons to get it, but Lola backs out the window and falls to Bugs' taxi below. On the way down, the perfume makes the wall invisible exposing, in successive apartments. General Foghorn puts out a reward of $500,000 for Bugs and Lola, and [[Yosemite Sam]], who was preparing to rob a bank in [[Times Square]] (with just a short-range water pistol), learns of it and apprehends them. However, he refuses to hand them to the NSA or the [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] until after he gets the money, and a one-sided gunfight ensues. Lola and Bugs escape and slip down a storm drain.  They emerge through a manhole in front of [[Porky Pig]], causing a traffic jam, but Giovanni grabs the perfume. Lola runs after him and gets abducted by Cecil in a van. Bugs jumps in [[Daffy Duck]]'s taxi and follows them. At a secret location, Cecil and his goons interrogate Lola and leave her to die, but Bugs and Daffy manage to free her. Driving through the streets (and subway tunnels) of New York and running through Central Park, the rabbits make haste to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]. Daffy envies the ducks in the park and decides to retire.  Having been arrested, Sam steals an NSA car and follows Bugs and Lola to the airport, where she spots Giovanni, and they all board the plane as does Cecil. Bugs retrieves the perfume and makes a parachute from clothes in passengers' checked baggage and, after a fight with Sam over the perfume, he and Lola land in the Atlantic Ocean. The [[Goofy Gophers]] pick them up in their yacht, try the perfume, and discover its invisibility property, albeit to Lola's dismay, but Bugs convinces her to see the upside. The Gophers subsequently give Lola a makeover while singing a song.  They arrive in Paris, and Bugs and Lola spray themselves, subsequently having fun with their invisibility: stealing lemonade, painting a picture of the perfume, smashing the [[Louvre]] Pyramid by playing baseball, going skiing in "Ze Alps" and cramming several cars into the [[Arc de Triomphe]]. When it rains, the invisibility wears off and they find themselves caught between Elmer Fudd and Cecil at the [[Pont des Arts]], Fudd holding the Gophers hostage. Cecil and his goons betray and disarm Fudd and the [[Interpol]] officers he hired with [[Heat-ray|heat ray pistols]], and Bugs tries to throw the bottle into the [[Seine]] to force the cops to stand down, but Sam catches it. They all dogpile on Sam, but are suddenly teleported to a space station over [[Mars]], where [[Marvin the Martian]] grabs the bottle, with Cecil revelating he works to Marvin. Cecil's goons unzip their costumes revealing they are Instant Martians, much to Cecil's confusion. Marvin reveals his plan to make all of Earth invisible, as it "[[Hare-Way to the Stars|obstructs [his] view of]] [[Venus]]". To do so, he extracts the invisibility part of the potion from the perfume part, but ends up with two identical bottles; one of them has invisibility and the other does not.  Bugs and Lola play switcheroo and end up with both of them, handing Marvin a [[Joker (playing card)|Joker card]]. They are chased to the Transporter Depot, but everyone crams into one pod overloading the system and causing them all to switch heads, bodies, and other parts. They continue to play body part swap for a while and even Screwball Daffy from ''[[Duck Amuck]]'' walks across the scene, and they are eventually restored. Marvin catches them, grabs the bottle, betrays/fires Cecil and sprays the Earth with perfume, not knowing that Bugs has switched it so Earth doesn't turn invisible. To Marvin's fury, Bugs turns the group and himself invisible, allowing them to escape the Martians, and they board the Martian Maggot. Before they leave, Bugs tosses Marvin the Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator, which Marvin was originally going to use to blow up Earth. Ironically, the Modulator [[Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century|blows up Mars instead]], killing the Instant Martians and leaving Marvin hanging from a root, remarking "I hate Earthlings." The Maggot returns the rest safely to Earth, landing in the Seine. When they accidentally leave the bottle in the spaceship, sinking with it, Fudd comes to believe the world is not ready for invisibility, and starts a one-sided chase to arrest Cecil for his complicity in Marvin's plan. Lola bitterly forgives Giovanni for stealing the perfume, and happily continues her relationship with Bugs. Unexpectedly, Speedy shows up to collect his "morning croissant" and briefly calls Lola out on her failures to pay rent while being able to visit Paris, before departing for [[Switzerland]].  One year later, perfume mogul [[Pepé Le Pew]] introduces his newest scent "Lola" and back in New York, Bugs reveals that he still has the invisibility potion, while Daffy has retired to Central Park. In a pre-credit scene, during a parody of the original "That's All Folks!" ending, Porky Pig says "Th-th-th-that's all, folks!" Daffy walks across with and sarcastically remarks "Interesting" whereupon Porky angrily hits Daffy on the head with a frying pan.

Look Who's Back (film)
 [[Berlin]], 2014. [[Adolf Hitler]] ([[Oliver Masucci]]) wakes up in the park where his former [[Führerbunker|wartime bunker]] once stood. As he wanders, disoriented, through the city, he interprets modern situations and things from a Nazi perspective.<ref name="Connolly"/><ref name="Jaafar"/><ref name="Hofmann"/><ref name="Lindsay"></ref> Everyone he meets assumes he is an actor. Attempting to ask directions to the Reichs Chancellery, Hitler is told by a mime to find his own spot and pepper-sprayed by a terrified young mother. He arrives at a newspaper kiosk and, reading that it is 2014, faints dead away.   Meanwhile, moviemaker Fabian Sawatzki ([[Fabian Busch]]) is fired from the television station MyTV and despondently watches the documentary he had been filming in the park where Hitler awoke. Seeing Hitler in the background, Sawatzki begins searching for him in hopes of getting his job back.   Waking at the kiosk, Hitler begins to read about modern Germany. Through the newspapers he discovers a completely different nation from the one he left and not one agreeable to him. Lamenting that Poland still exists on formerly German soil, Hitler says the whole war was a waste. He decides that destiny has resurrected him for a reason and vows to continue his work.  After finding the kiosk, Sawatzki proposes to travel across Germany with Hitler and film him for [[YouTube]]. Hitler agrees, and the two leave together. Travelling from the North Sea Coast to Bavaria, Sawatzki films Hitler interacting with ordinary Germans and promising to solve their problems with immigrants and guest-workers. When a Bavarian tells Hitler that he will never follow him, Hitler demands his name and address, saying that it's for "the first wave of arrests". The Bavarian responds that he isn't worried.   Sawatzki's idea for an animal-centred film clip ends when Hitler shoots a dog with a concealed FN Model 1910 pistol. Sawatzki is outraged, but Hitler calls him a weakling and vows to make a man out of him. While their videos gain over a million hits, Sawatzki and Hitler return to Berlin. Sawatzki introduces both Hitler and his programme idea to the MyTV station chiefs. The MyTV chairman, Katja Bellini ([[Katja Riemann]]), decides to use Hitler in one of MyTV's comedies.   Before the show, Hitler learns about the Internet and uses the Web to prepare his return to politics. On air, Hitler presents his old plans for an ethnically homogenous Fascist State, and unintentionally becomes a big comedy hit. As his unintentional success in comedy increases, Christoph Sensebrink ([[Christoph Maria Herbst]]), one of MyTV's executives, discovers the unedited footage of Hitler shooting the dog. Sensebrink airs the footage, ruining the burgeoning careers of Hitler, Sawatzki, and Bellini, and resulting in his own promotion to station chief.  With the help of Bellini and Sawatzki, Hitler publishes an autobiographical book about his new life in the 21st century, ''Er ist wieder da'', and it becomes a bestseller. Soon after, Sawatzki turns the book into a film. Without Hitler, MyTV's ratings and ad revenue drop precipitously and Sensebrink, after a fit of rage parodying Hitler's breakdown scene in the German drama film ''[[Downfall (2004 film)|Downfall]]'', decides he must rehire Hitler.  Hitler plays himself in the movie and during the filming he is beaten by two [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazis]] who believe him to be a fraudulent impersonator mocking their beliefs. Hitler is hospitalized, but the news of his beating generates sympathy and he returns to high standing with the German people. While Hitler is recuperating, Sawatzki reviews his old footage and discovers a ''[[The Terminator|Terminator]]''-esque ball of energy in the background before Hitler first appeared. Returning to the site, he finds burnt leaves. With horror, he realizes that the Hitler he encountered was the real person all along. He rushes to the hospital to confront Hitler, but finds only Katja, who says Hitler is at the movie studio. After Katja doesn't understand Sawatzki when he says Hitler is real, he trashes the hospital room and runs for the exit pursued by two hospital orderlies.  Sawatzki arrives at the movie studio, where he forces Hitler to the roof at gunpoint with his own pistol. Calmly, Hitler replies that he was elected by the German people, and if he is a monster, then so is everyone who voted for him. Enraged, Sawatzki shoots Hitler in the face and watches him fall off the roof to his apparent death. Suddenly Hitler reappears behind Sawatzki, claiming he cannot be killed, as he is a part of every German. This entire scene is revealed to be a part of the film, and Sawatzki a [[body double]] in a silicone mask. The real Sawatzki has been committed to a [[mental hospital]] following his previous outburst.  Once the work for his film finishes, Hitler senses that he is on the path to a political comeback. He is more popular than ever, and nationalist Germans give him hope that Germany may be ready for his return to power. With Hitler and Bellini riding in the back seat of an open Mercedes-Benz W31 convertible and among images of actual nationalist demonstrations, the film ends with Hitler's words, "I can work with this".  [[Lead Belly]]'s 1942 Blues song ''Mr. Hitler'' plays over the credits.

Conrad meanwhile is angry, aggressive and seemingly suicidal himself, frequently fantasizing about his mother and her death and obsessing over one of his female classmates. Jonah, Isabelle and Gene's oldest child, comes down to visit his father and Conrad and also go over his mother's work before it is donated to a museum. Though Jonah appears to his father to be the normal, stable one, he refuses to believe that his mother died by suicide and censors her work, deleting some of her photographs which appear to show her having an affair. At the hospital, when his child was being born, Jonah ran into an old girlfriend, Erin, whose mother was dying of cancer. He allows her to believe that his wife also has cancer. Wanting to return home after visiting his father and brother Jonah stops by Erin's house and the two have sex with Jonah telling Erin that he has never told his wife about his mother or the way she died. After the encounter, rather than return home, he goes back to his father's house and lies to his wife telling her that the family needs him more than he expected.

Conrad wants to give the diary to Melanie, the girl he has a crush on, but Jonah dissuades him from doing so telling him she will laugh at him. Conrad ignores his brother's advice and prints out his diary, leaving it on Melanie's stoop.

Richard reveals to him that he and Isabelle had an ongoing affair overseas but that she was never interested in continuing the affair at home.  Richard's article comes out earlier than expected and Jonah takes the news poorly. As Gene hasn't had the chance to tell Conrad yet he repeatedly tries to contact him, but Conrad ignores him and goes to a party where he is able to hang out with Melanie. As she is drunk he walks her home. Returning to his own home Conrad asks his father if what the paper said about Isabelle is true. He accepts the news graciously, but tells his father that Jonah is handling the situation badly.  Jonah is unable to return home having avoided his wife and child for a while now, but Gene offers to drive him there. Gene, Conrad, and Jonah drive in the car towards Jonah's home, and Conrad recounts a dream he had in which his mother brought home a baby from overseas who was an old man that was actually Jonah's baby.

This unwanted pregnancy ended the relationship between Murphy and Electra on a horrible note, and it forced Murphy to get married to Omi.  On a rainy 1 January morning, Electra's mother, Nora, phones Murphy at his small Paris apartment where he lives with Omi and their 18-month-old son to ask him if he's heard from the young woman, because she hasn't for three months, and given her daughter's suicidal tendencies, she is really worried.

Love Live! The School Idol Movie
  The movie begins with a scene from the second years' childhood, where Honoka is trying to jump over a puddle left from the rain, with Kotori cheering her on and Umi watching from behind a tree. Despite failing multiple times and being asked by Kotori to give up and go home instead, she finally manages to soar over it in the end.  The story takes place after the events of the second season, where μ's receives a notification that the organizers of Love Live! intend to hold a third competition, aiming to hold it within Tokyo Dome this time. But in order to achieve that dream, they require more publicity in order to have it become a sell-out concert. Therefore, to spread the appeal of school idols to even more people, they have decided to send μ's to the [[United States]], where a TV agency has offered to do a cover on them. Even though μ's had already decided to disband, they agree to perform in order to help Love Live! gather more support, as they are still school idols until the end of the month.  While preparing for the live and doing their training in [[New York City]], μ's continues to enjoy themselves as tourists as well, with the insert song "Hello, Hoshi o Kazoete" played at the end of the montage. During one of these times, however, Honoka gets separated from the rest of the group. Lost in a foreign land, she encounters a lone Japanese female singer performing on the streets, and is charmed by her beautiful voice singing [[As Time Goes By (song)|As Times Go By]]. On the way back to the hotel, Honoka asks about her story, and realises that they were the same. The singer also used to perform music with her close friends, and ended up alone in New York after many encounters and partings. Honoka was led back to her hotel safely by the singer, but when she turned to introduce her to the rest of μ's, the singer had already vanished. Honoka was left carrying the singer's microphone set, with one question lingering in her head from their conversation: "What's most important is, whose sake do you sing for?" The first section of the movie concludes with them performing "Angelic Angel" in New York's [[Times Square]] and [[Central Park]].  After returning to Japan, μ's had become tremendously popular, with the whole of Akihabara covered in their advertisements and goods. Since the video from New York was broadcast across Japan, the girls are now stars, needing to sneak around wearing disguises, with the insert song "？←Heartbeat" playing. But with all the fans telling them that they want μ's to continue forever, the girls' hearts begin to waver regarding their decision to disband. They realise that they have to answer to their fans, and they have only two choices. To surpass the barrier of being only school idols and become actual idols, or to hold onto their original determination and halt activities upon the third years' graduation. Principal Minami also calls them to her office, informing them that she too wishes them to continue even if they have to reinvent themselves as something other than school idols. While Honoka is fretting over the decision at night, Tsubasa calls her out on a late night ride with A-Rise, and tells her about the possibility of lengthening μ's career just like they themselves had, and introduce their management company to her.  Faced with the dilemma out in the middle of a rainstorm, Honoka hears a lone voice singing, and runs into the same singer she met before. Insisting that she needed to thank her, Honoka drags her back to her home, only to have her stop just outside, saying that that was good enough. The singer then asks if Honoka had found the answer to her question yet. After having Honoka close her eyes, the two of them are transported to a hill full of flowers, in front of a large lake. The singer then asks Honoka to jump over the lake, telling her that she definitely can fly whenever she wanted. Honoka proceeds to run down the hill and take the jump, reaffirming her love for the existence of school idols. Eli also sends Honoka a message on behalf of the third years after they had discussed it, telling her their decision to stop activities.  Honoka wakes up the next morning and heads back to the rooftop, where everyone has come to the same decision. There, Honoka announces her final idea, to hold a concert to promote all school idols as their final contribution to the industry. She goes over to UTX High School where she pitches the idea to Tsubasa, who accepts it readily. Despite having sent emails to all school idols across the country, not many of them are accepting of it, which leads Honoka to decide that they need to meet them personally in order for their feelings to get through. "Future Style" plays after this sequence.  Using Maki's money for train fare, they head out in groups of three across the nation to convince school idols to join their endeavor. The massive crowd gathers in Akiba at the end, and begins preparing for the school idol festival to occur. Kotori and Anju work together on the costumes, while Maki and Tsubasa work on the song. On the final evening before the event, Honoka announces to everyone the news of μ's disbandment, to everyone's dismay.  The day of the festival finally arrives, and all of μ's heads towards Akiba together. As Eli decides to start a race there and μ's begins running, Honoka is distracted by a single drifting petal, reminiscent of the flowers upon the hill in the illusionary world. She begins to run while doing pirouettes and spins along the way, feeling that just like before, she really can soar anytime she wanted now with the burden off her shoulders. When she gets to the site, all of μ's is greeted by the sight of all of the school idols already there, dressed in costumes following a style similar to their own design. The massive crowd parts to give them a clear path to the stage, and the festival begins with the performance of "Sunny Day Song", which is now the song for all school idols.  A new school year begins in Otonokizaka High School, with Yukiho and Alisa shown as third years carrying on μ's' will and discussing their plans for the Idol Research Club. The pair give the welcoming speech to the freshmen, talking about how the school was saved by μ's and talking about their final performance. Meanwhile, a reformed μ's partakes in one of their first professional idol concerts, as they have agreed offscreen to continue on with their idol career together as nine. The movie concludes with "Bokutachi wa Hitotsu no Hikari" where μ's is shown performing at Tokyo Dome, beginning their career as a professional idol team.

Macbeth (2015 film)
 ===Act I=== The film starts with the funeral of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's child, with both parents grieving for their loss (a scene not in the original play).<ref>The funeral is not in Shakespeare's play, nor does the play directly mention the death of a child, but in Act 1, Scene 7, Lady Macbeth says "I have given suck, and know how tender 't is to love the babe that milks me," implying perhaps a child that died.</ref>  Macbeth, who supports King Duncan in the civil war, is leading royal troops into a final battle. Macbeth emerges victorious, but there are heavy losses, including many boy soldiers. The battle is observed by three women with a small girl and an infant. They approach Macbeth and Banquo, hailing Macbeth as [[Thane (Scotland)|Thane]] of [[Cawdor]] and future King, and Banquo as a father of Kings, before disappearing in the mist.  ===Act II=== Duncan hears about Macbeth's victory and is brought the [[Thane of Cawdor]] who, deemed to be a traitor because he has allied himself with an the [[Norsemen|Norse]] invaders, is stripped of his title and executed. The King orders his servants to take the title of Thane of Cawdor to Macbeth, who reacts uncertainly. Macbeth sends a message ahead to his wife, Lady Macbeth, telling her about the witches' prophecies. Lady Macbeth then prays to the dark spirits in the village church, asking them for guidance. When Macbeth returns, and tells her that Duncan will stay one night as their guest, she urges Macbeth to kill the King to fulfill the prophecy made by the witches. Duncan arrives at the village and a feast is being held, where the King pronounces Malcolm as his heir. Macbeth still hesitates and Lady Macbeth persuades him to commit the deed, while she slips a sleeping potion to the King's servants. After the feast ends, Macbeth sees the ghost of one of the dead boy soldiers who gives him a dagger and leads him towards Duncan's tent. Macbeth brutally slays Duncan. Malcolm enters the tent and, seeing what Macbeth has done, flees in fear. Shaken, Macbeth goes to his wife and gives her the dagger he has used to kill the King. Lady Macbeth rebukes him, saying that he should have left it in the tent and she goes herself to place the dagger in the hands of the sleeping chamberlains. Later she meets Macbeth in the church where they both wash the blood from their hands and she tells him that the water has washed their deed away.  ===Act III=== In the morning, Macduff finds Duncan dead, and Macbeth slaughters the sleeping servants to prevent their denial of the murder. Macduff and Lennox, a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] noble, discuss that as Malcolm has fled to [[Kingdom of England|England]] that puts him under suspicion of being involved in the murder. They also admire Macbeth's justice on the supposedly-treacherous servants. With Malcolm gone, Macbeth is asked to become King of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]. After the coronation he sits in a sour mood in his chamber where Lady Macbeth comes to him. He complains that killing Duncan was for nothing as Macbeth has no heirs to inherit the crown which will pass to Banquo and his son, Fleance, according to the prophecy. He invites Banquo with his son to a banquet and finds out that they both plan to leave. As Banquo is becoming suspicious, Macbeth sends three assassins to murder him. Banquo is killed, but Fleance escapes to the woods.  During the evening, Macbeth makes a comment about Banquo not keeping his promise to be at the feast. When the assassins arrive, Macbeth asks if they have succeeded and is enraged when he finds out that Fleance has escaped. Then Macbeth sees Banquo's ghost in his armour standing among other guests next to the table. Macbeth is afraid and starts to talk to the ghost which is unseen by anyone else present. Lady Macbeth tries to calm everyone by claiming that her husband is unwell, but Macbeth continues to rave, which prompts Macduff and his wife to leave the feast despite the King ordering them to stay. Lady Macbeth dismisses all the guests and takes Macbeth back to their chamber.  ===Act IV=== Macbeth travels by night to talk to the three witches. Once he finds them, they show him a vision of slain soldiers who tell him to beware of Macduff, and that Macbeth shall be King until [[Great Birnam Wood]] comes to [[Dunsinane Hill]], where the royal castle is built. Finally, the ghost of the slain boy soldier who gave him the dagger tells Macbeth that he won't be slain by any man born of a woman. The King is found wandering the hills by Lennox who tells him that Macduff has fled to England. Anxious at this, in a fit of rage, Macbeth orders Macduff's family and servants to be killed. Lady Macduff and her children are captured and [[burned at the stake]], while a distraught Lady Macbeth watches the execution. After the burning she takes out the dagger that was used to kill Duncan and repeatedly washes it.  Meanwhile, Macduff meets up with Malcolm, who is gathering troops in England. Ross and Angus inform Macduff about the murder of his family and servants. Stricken with grief and anger, Macduff swears revenge and he and Malcolm join forces to challenge Macbeth.  ===Act V=== Haunted by guilt, Lady Macbeth returns to the church in her village, which is now abandoned, and laments the terrible deeds that have been done, and how her hands are covered in blood. She then sees the ghost of her dead child, which she urges to go to bed. Then she wanders in the hills and sees the three witches as she walks towards them.  In the castle, rumours spread that Macbeth has gone mad and his subjects fear his anger and [[tyrannical]] behaviour. Macbeth is told that his wife is dead. Saying "[[tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow]]", he then lifts her body and carries it around the chamber in despair. Seyton then brings him news that Malcolm is leading an army against him and Macbeth orders his armour to be brought to him.  Macduff sets Birnam Wood on fire, with the smoke and ashes blowing towards the castle, seemingly making the witches' prophecy come true. Macbeth leaves the castle to face the attacking army and engages in a duel with Macduff. Macbeth is confident that he will win as "no man born of woman" can kill him. Macduff then tells him that he was [[Caesarean section|untimely ripped]] from his mother's womb and, using Macbeth's distraction, he stabs him. Macbeth starts to regret the mistakes he has made through his tyranny, despite knowing all too well that it's too late to redeem himself. Rather than surrendering, Macbeth refuses to accept defeat and to bow down before Malcolm. As soon as he finishes making his final speech to Macduff, Macbeth allows himself to be fatally stabbed by his nemesis. The three witches, who were observing the battle, leave when Macbeth dies on the battlefield. Immediately after Macbeth's death, Malcolm is hailed King of Scotland and he, Macduff and their forces abandon Macbeth's corpse and make their way to his castle.  Malcolm leaves the throne room while Fleance takes Macbeth's sword and charges through the empty battlefield, disappearing into the smoke.

Max chooses to stay behind, but after seeing visions of a child he failed to save, he convinces them to return to the undefended Citadel, which has ample water and greenery that Joe keeps for himself, and trap Joe and his army in the bikers' canyon.  The group heads back to the Citadel, but they are attacked en route by Joe's forces, and Furiosa is seriously wounded. Joe positions his car in front of the War Rig to slow it, while Max fights Joe's giant son, Rictus Erectus. Joe captures Toast, who manages to distract him long enough for Furiosa to kill him. Nux sacrifices himself by wrecking the Rig, killing Rictus and blocking the canyon, allowing Max, Furiosa, the wives, and the surviving Vuvalini to escape in Joe's car, where Max transfuses his blood to Furiosa, saving her life.  At the Citadel, the impoverished citizens react to Joe's death with joy. Furiosa, the wives, and the Vuvalini are cheered by the people and welcomed by the remaining War Boys.

Maggie (film)
 In the present-day [[Midwestern United States]], society struggles to function in the aftermath of a [[zombie]] pandemic barely under control (Necroambulism). Maggie Vogel ([[Abigail Breslin]]) calls her father from a broken city under curfew; her voicemail urges that he not seek her and that she loves him. Her arm was bitten. Knowing she has only weeks before the "Necroambulist virus" turns her cannibalistic, she left home to protect her family. Maggie's father Wade ([[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]) has searched two weeks, despite her warning. Finding her in a hospital for the infected, he brings Maggie home to care for her until she must eventually be quarantined. During their return, a zombie attacks Wade at an abandoned gasoline station and he breaks its neck.  At home, Maggie’s younger half-siblings Bobby and Molly (Aidan and Carsen Flowers) are leaving to stay with their aunt. Maggie talks to Bobby, who mostly understands what she is undergoing. She withdraws from her family, struggling to cope with her hopeless situation and torn about contacting her friends. Falling from a swing, she breaks a finger on her infected arm, from which black fluid oozes. Terrified, even though she feels little or no pain, and despairing over her deteriorating body, Maggie cuts off the finger. She flees outside and encounters a neighbor, Nathan, and his young daughter, both senseless with infection. Wade kills both zombies but feels extreme remorse. The responding sheriff and deputy consider Wade blameless, instead blaming Nathan’s wife Bonnie, who hid her infected family from the authorities. Bonnie visits Wade that night, decrying the dehumanizing treatment of the infected and revealing that Nathan had locked himself in with his sick daughter, becoming infected himself, rather than abandon her to death among strangers in quarantine.  A doctor warns Wade that Maggie’s condition is worsening quickly, leaving him three eventual options: she can be quarantined, which Wade refuses; Wade can administer at home the same euthanasia injection offered in quarantine, which he’s warned is painful; or Wade can "make it quick" himself. Wade and Maggie make the most of their remaining days, reminiscing about Maggie's deceased mother. Despite Maggie's physical deterioration (she’s woken by maggots wriggling in her dying arm) she struggles to maintain normality. She attends a bonfire with high school friends Allie and an infected boy, Trent (Bryce Romero), whom Maggie previously dated, and whom she kisses. He tells rumors of horrible conditions at the quarantine facilities, saying he would die before going there.  One day, Maggie smells food near her stepmother Caroline ([[Joely Richardson]]), though Caroline smells nothing and muses that Wade must be cooking downstairs. Finding the kitchen empty, Caroline realizes in horror that Maggie has begun to smell living flesh, in this case Caroline's, as food. Maggie receives a desperate call from Trent. At his home, Trent has locked himself inside his bedroom after he too felt hunger smelling another human. Maggie tries to comfort him but watches helplessly as the police forcibly remove Trent to quarantine.  Back home, Maggie encounters a trapped fox in the woods. Later she runs into her home, hysterical and coated in blood, admitting through tears to her frightened parents that she freed the fox but then couldn't stop herself from attacking it. Wade shoots the half-eaten fox. Caroline departs and urges Wade it’s time Maggie is taken away. Two officers arrive and Wade fights one of them before Maggie appears, assuring them she has not yet turned. The sympathetic sheriff leaves Wade with a warning that he’d better decide what to do with her before they next come to check on Maggie.  Wade shows Maggie white daisies he’s grown in her mother’s old garden, "Daisy" being a nickname he sometimes uses for Maggie. She thanks him for the garden’s beauty, but also begs him to promise that he will "make it stop" before she grows worse. Later, Wade sits alone with his shotgun, still unable to use it. He pretends to sleep when Maggie approaches, her skin now gray and her eyes blackened. She lingers over him, smelling him, seemingly on the edge of self-control, before kissing his forehead. She then climbs to the roof and jumps off, her last memories being of herself as a child frolicking outdoors with her mother, picking a daisy.  
Magic Mike XXL
  Three years after abandoning his life as a stripper, Mike is running his own furniture business. He receives a call from Tarzan who informs Mike that Dallas is "gone". Believing that his former boss has died, Mike drives to a hotel only to find that his friends, the remaining Kings of Tampa, are enjoying themselves at a pool party. After revealing that Dallas has bailed on them to start a new show in Macau and only took "The Kid" (referencing Adam from ''Magic Mike'') with him, the Kings let Mike in on their plan: to end their careers on a high note by traveling to Myrtle Beach for a stripping convention. Later, while trying to work, Mike overhears a song he used to strip to and dances. Reinvigorated, Mike decides to join them on their trip.  Driving in a fro-yo van owned by Tito and Tobias, they decide to make their first stop at Mad Mary's. To prove to Richie that he's willing to commit to the trip, Mike participates in an amateur drag queen contest. The others join him soon after. They then head down to a beach where Mike attempts to resolve his issues with Ken through violence. The two later reconcile. Mike also meets a photographer named Zoe who tells him that she's headed for New York. They flirt but mutually agree that they should not have sex.  Back on the road, Mike suggests that they change their routine after the group (excepting Tarzan) take MDMA. They stop at a gas station where he coerces Richie into trying to make the cashier smile with an improvised striptease which he successfully does. This inspires the others to abandon their old routines. Soon afterward, Tobias, under the influence of [[MDMA]], passes out while driving and crashes the van. Everyone is left unscathed aside from Tobias who gets a concussion. In the hospital, the group begins to lose morale, and contemplate packing up and heading home. Mike then reveals that his furniture business isn't going that well and that he's no longer dating Brooke after she rejected his marriage proposal. The group decides to continue on.  In search of a new emcee, Mike brings the group to a [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] strip club owned by Rome, a woman that Mike has a history with. Despite proving to her that his skills haven't deteriorated, he's unsuccessful in getting her to help them. However, she does give them a ride to their next stop by having Andre, a rapper/singer who works at the club, drive them there.  The group arrives at a mansion. Tito tells them that he knows the girl who lives there and that she's expecting them. They walk in through the door but are greeted by the girl's mother, Nancy, along with Nancy's friends who are all middle-aged women. Nancy's teasing of the group initially makes them feel awkward but as the night goes on, the mood lightens. During this time, Mike meets Zoe again. Zoe confesses that she was hired by another photographer as his assistant solely so he could try to start an affair with her, despite being married. Mike urges her to come to the convention to regain her smile.  After sleeping with Richie, Nancy allows the group to drive her ex-husband's car to [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]]. When they arrive, they are surprised to see Rome. Rome, after having a change of heart, agrees to be their emcee. She also brings along Andre and Malik to help. With their preparations complete, they head to the convention where they manage to squeeze in a spot thanks to Rome and her seemingly romantic history with the organizer of the event, Paris. The group's performance is a success. During Mike and Malik's performance, Mike brings Zoe on stage. The film ends in celebration, Tobias returning with the fro-yo van and everyone watching the 4th of July fireworks.

The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (film)
 In 1963, at the height of the [[Cold War]], professional thief-turned [[CIA]] agent [[Napoleon Solo]] extracts Gaby Teller, daughter of Dr. Udo Teller, an alleged [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] scientist-turned United States collaborator at the end of World War II, from [[East Berlin]], evading [[KGB]] operative [[Illya Kuryakin]]. He later reports to his superior, Sanders, who reveals that Gaby's maternal uncle Rudi works in a shipping company owned by Alexander and Victoria Vinciguerra, a wealthy Nazi sympathizer couple who intend to use Teller to build their own private [[nuclear weapon]] and give it to lingering Nazi elements. Due to the potentially world-ending nature of this crisis, the CIA and KGB have reluctantly teamed up, and Solo and Kuryakin are ordered to stop the Vinciguerras from succeeding, with both men secretly assigned to steal Udo Teller's research for their respective governments.  The trio travels to [[Rome]], where Gaby and Kuryakin reluctantly pose as an engaged couple, and Solo pretends to be an antiquities dealer. Solo deduces they are being monitored and instructs Kuryakin not to defend himself from muggers so as to preserve this cover. Despite their hostilities towards each other, Kuryakin heeds his advice and does not react when his father’s prized watch is stolen. Later, at an auto racing event promoted by the Vinciguerras, Solo and Gaby flirt with Victoria and Alexander to obtain information about Teller. Meanwhile, Kuryakin acquires evidence the Vinciguerras were recently exposed to radiation, indicating that their weapon is near completion.  Solo and Kuryakin begrudgingly join forces to break into a Vinciguerra shipping yard, in which they find traces of uranium. After accidentally setting off the alarm, they escape into the water but find their way blocked. During a scuffle with the guards, Kuryakin nearly drowns. Solo escapes but surprises himself by returning to save Kuryakin. Although a suspicious Victoria pursues them with her henchmen, Solo and Kuryakin manage to slip past into their own rooms undetected. Victoria and Solo spend the night together. The following day, Gaby meets with Rudi and Alexander to discuss a job, but unexpectedly betrays Kuryakin and Solo to them. Kuryakin escapes but Victoria drugs and captures Solo and takes him to a nearby warehouse. There, Rudi, who is revealed as an infamous Nazi war criminal, tortures Solo in an [[electric chair]]. Solo is rescued by Kuryakin, who tortures Rudi. Rudi reveals that the weapon is hidden in an island fortress where Gaby has been reunited with her father. The chair malfunctions and Rudi is killed. Solo and Kuryakin travel to the fortress.  To protect Gaby, Dr. Teller pretends to resume work on the weapon but intends to sabotage it. Victoria quickly sees through this deception, and has Alexander imprison Gaby as an incentive. Victoria kills him as soon as he has finished the weapon.  Meanwhile, Solo and Kuryakin are approached by [[Alexander Waverly]], a high-ranking [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]]S operative who reveals that Gaby is an undercover agent under his employment. He and members of the [[Special Boat Service]] help Solo and Kuryakin infiltrate the Vinciguerras's compound. While they search the compound, Solo finds Kuryakin's stolen watch on a guard. Vinciguerra then attempts to escape with Gaby and the warhead, but is intercepted and killed. Solo retrieves the disc with Teller’s research, but the warhead Vinciguerra was taking with him was a non-nuclear secondary missile. Victoria has left undetected on another boat with the real warhead. Solo is able to contact Victoria via radio and keep her on the line long enough for Waverly to locate her and launch a homing missile, destroying the nuclear weapon and the boat, taking Victoria with them.  Kuryakin confronts Solo in his hotel room, intending to kill him and steal the disc for the [[Soviet Union]], but changes his mind when Solo produces Kuryakin's father’s stolen watch. They instead share a drink on the terrace and burn the contents of the disk, so as to not give either of their countries the upper hand in the [[Nuclear arms race|arms race]]. Reuniting with Gaby and Waverly, they are told that the trio has been reassigned to a new international organization under Waverly's command. Waverly gives them a new mission in [[Istanbul]] under a new codename: [[U.N.C.L.E.]].

The Man Who Knew Infinity (film)
 At the turn of the twentieth century, [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] is a struggling and indigent citizen in the city of [[Madras]] in [[India]] working at menial jobs at the edge of poverty. While performing his menial labor, his employers notice that he seems to have exceptional skills at mathematics and they begin to make use of him for rudimentary accounting tasks. It becomes equally clear to his employers, who are college educated, that Ramanujan's mathematical insights exceed the simple accounting tasks they are assigning to him and soon they encourage him to make his personal writings in mathematics available to the general public and to start to contact professors of mathematics at universities by writing to them. One such letter is sent to [[G.H. Hardy]], a famous mathematician at [[University of Cambridge]], who begins to take a special interest in Ramanujan.<ref></ref>  Ramanujan at this time also marries while performing his menial labor and sending out his first publications. Hardy soon invites him to come to Cambridge to test Ramanujan's mettle as a potential theoretical mathematician. Ramanujan is overwhelmed by the opportunity and decides to pursue Hardy's offer to visit Cambridge University even though this means he must leave his wife for an extended period. He parts lovingly with his wife and promises to keep up his correspondence with her.  Upon arrival at Cambridge, Ramanujan is met with various forms of racial prejudice and finds his adjustment to England to be more difficult than expected, though Hardy is much impressed by Ramanujan's abilities. Hardy remains concerned about Ramanujan's ability to communicate effectively due to Ramanujan's lack of experience in writing [[Mathematical proof|proofs]], but with perseverance he manages to get Ramanujan published in a major journal.<ref></ref> In the meantime, Ramanujan finds out that he suffers from [[tuberculosis]] and his frequent letters home to his wife remain unanswered after many months. Hardy continues to see much more promise in Ramanujan, however he remains unaware of the personal difficulties his student is having with his housing and with his lack of contact with his family back home in India. Ramanujan's health worsens while he continues delving into deeper and more profound research interests in mathematics under the guidance of Hardy and others at Cambridge.  His wife, after much elapsed time, wonders why she has not heard from Ramanujan and eventually discovers that his mother has been intercepting his letters. While still in England, Hardy takes special efforts to get Ramanujan's now recognizably exceptional mathematical skills to be fully accepted by his university by nominating Ramanujan for fellowship at Cambridge University. At first Hardy fails for reasons related to university politics and recurrent ethnic prejudice at the university at the time of [[World War I]]. By later gaining the support of key members of the faculty, Hardy then again nominates Ramanujan for fellowship and he is accepted as a Fellow of the Royal Society and then as a Fellow of Trinity College. Ramanujan is eventually reunited with his family in India though his declining health, which suffered from poor housing and harsh winter weather in England, ultimately takes its toll and leads to his premature demise all too soon after gaining recognition as a mathematician of international merit and importance.  
Man Down (film)
 The story transpires in a non-linear fashion, following U.S. Marine Gabriel Drummer in training, in battle in Afghanistan, in counselling in Afghanistan, while searching for his family after returning to a devastated United States, and in his final moments as his broken mind returns to reality.  Drummer is at [[Camp LeJeune]], training as a U.S. Marine.  He and wife Natalie have a young son, Jonathan. When Jonathan gets bullied at school after Natalie tells him, "I love you", in front of his schoolmates, Gabriel comes up with "man down" as a secret code for "I love you".  Gabriel leaves to serve a tour of duty in Afghanistan.  Devin Roberts is his best friend since childhood and fellow Marine. Devin stays home for a few extra weeks while recuperating from a broken arm.  Devin arrives in Afghanistan, where he and Gabriel are "battle buddies, kicking in doors together and taking enemy fire", further reinforcing their friendship. When their squad is ambushed, Devin is fatally shot and apologizes to Gabriel just before he dies. Gabriel finds a note inside Devin's helmet, on which Devin's password for a video chatting website is written. Gabriel accesses the website and realizes that Natalie cheated on him with Devin.  Gabriel is deeply traumatized by the series of events. Still in Afghanistan, he begins mandatory counseling sessions with therapist Captain Peyton, who is concerned about Gabriel's mental condition. However, Gabriel insists that he is okay and walks out of Peyton's office.  When Gabriel returns home, he finds his city devastated. Accompanied (inexplicably - a sign of his break from reality) by Devin, he searches the ruins for Natalie and Jonathan. The two encounter Charles, a civilian trying to survive in the wasteland of the former city.  When Gabriel finds that Charles has the envelope from a letter that Gabriel wrote to Jonathan, he and Charles scuffle. In the confusion, Devin accidentally shoots Charles.  In the final minutes of the film, events finally sort themselves out for the viewer (but not for Gabriel). Gabriel is again seen returning home, on medical discharge for mental issues, to a perfectly normal city &ndash; although he is greeted by Devin, whom no one else can see. Natalie is uncertain about Gabriel's state of mind from the loss of Devin and the loss of Gabriel's trust in her. We see that Gabriel ends up living on the streets, regularly traumatizing his family and eventually shooting Charles, who was simply another troubled person living on the streets.   Brandishing a gun, shooting their dog, a confused Gabriel "rescues" Jonathan from the "ruins" of their home, hiding with him in another "ruined" building (in reality the main floor of his own home), where they are soon surrounded by the police.  He strangles (and possibly kills) a policeman and keeps radioing Devin for backup. Natalie comes down the stairs &ndash; although Gabriel sees her as the Afghani woman who shot Devin and holds a gun to her head. He suddenly finds clarity and apologizes to Natalie and Jonathan for his confusion just moments before a police sniper shoots him repeatedly.  The screen fades to black, then shows the text: *1 in 5 veterans of [[Iraq War|the Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan wars]] are diagnosed with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] *200,000 veterans go homeless each night *20 veterans commit suicide every day

As Benny helps Darryl move into his apartment, the two become friends.  Connie, who initially disbelieves the gossips when they say Darryl is the most attractive man they've ever seen, makes a fool of herself when introducing herself to him.  She later encounters Darryl while exercising in the park, explaining that she is trying to get back into shape to save her marriage.  Darryl offers to be her personal trainer.

He is stopped by a wealthy man named Cain, who explains he, too, considered suicide at the same bridge several years ago.  Cain offers him a job and shares his life philosophy: one's old life and problems must be left behind at the bridge.  Meanwhile, at the apartment complex, Darryl and Krystal have sex, revealing they had previously been in a relationship.  Krystal, however, blows off Darryl once Slim proposes to her.  Benny counsels Darryl to forget about Krystal, impressing Darryl with his maturity for a 20-year-old.  As they talk, Benny finds ''[[On the Down Low]]'', a non-fiction book about closeted gay African-American men.  Benny becomes uncomfortable and quickly leaves.  Under Cain's guidance, Avery becomes an armed robber.  After spending time with Cain and becoming intoxicated with his decadent lifestyle, Avery tells Connie he wants a divorce.  Upset and hurt, Connie turns to Darryl, and the two begin a relationship.  She is surprised when the police come asking about Avery and Cain, searching her apartment with a warrant.  Krystal comes on to Darryl, offering to maintain an affair, which Darryl rejects.  When Slim catches her coming on Darryl, she accuses Darryl of attempted rape.  Darryl's life is further complicated when Benny makes a pass at him, assuming Darryl to be gay.  Benny is crushed when Darryl explains he is straight and was only trying to understand his gay brother's struggles by reading ''On the Down Low''.  In denial that his son is gay, Ben angrily accuses Darryl of trying to corrupt Benny.  At the same time, Avery learns of Darryl's and Connie's relationship.  Amid these issues, Darryl is found dead in his apartment after an arson.  Detectives Thomas and Anderson question each of the occupants.  Eventually, evidence is found in Ben's apartment, and he confesses to the murder, assuming Benny is the killer.  The police become suspicious when they learn Avery was seen in the apartment complex prior to Darryl's death, and they press Connie for details, also learning from Krystal that her mother died mysteriously in a fire.  Krystal, who blames Connie for her mother's death, is shocked when the police reveal evidence tying her father to the murder of both her mother and Darryl.  After making a plea bargain to avoid jail time for aiding her father's escape, she works with the police to set a trap.  Three months later, Connie leaves the apartment complex.  She hands Darryl's brother's number to Benny, who has reconciled with his now-freed father.  In Jamaica, she meets up with Darryl, who is revealed to be alive.  Connie flashes back to the day of Darryl's faked death: after being abandoned by Cain, Avery returns to the apartment to rob Connie.  When Avery threatens to kill Darryl, Connie kills him, then helps Darryl make it look like Avery had killed him.  After Connie leads the police to Avery as a suspect, she helps him impersonate Avery by sending incriminating text messages to Krystal, whose trap he ignores.

Next, Ove attempts suicide by [[carbon monoxide poisoning]], by sitting in his running car in a garage. He once again recollects the past, when he began working at the train company. Two men from the local council, whom Ove dubs "The Whiteshirts", arrive at young Ove's home and declare it should be demolished. Ove instead fixes the house. His neighbors' home catches fire one night, and Ove saves two people. Sparks from the fire cause his own home to burn, but The Whiteshirts tell the firemen not to put the fire out. With nowhere to go, Ove sleeps in a train at work; he wakes up to find a young woman, Sonja, sitting across from him. He is smitten with her and returns to the same early train each morning. After three weeks, he finds her again, and they begin dating. She encourages him to return to school, and he earns a degree in engineering.  Back in the present, Ove's attempt to kill himself is interrupted by Parvaneh banging on the garage, wanting a ride. Ove then goes to the train station and plans to jump in front of a train. However, a man on the platform faints and falls onto the tracks. Nobody moves to help him, so Ove jumps down and drags him off the tracks. Parvaneh asks Ove to teach her how to drive, and he eventually agrees. He also takes in a stray cat upon Parvaneh's insistence. He tells Parvaneh about the early days in their neighborhood, when he and Rune worked together to establish rules and order, with Ove chairman of the neighborhood association board and Rune the deputy chair. They grew apart over the years despite being neighbors, until Rune organized a "coup" and replaced Ove as chairman. Ove takes care of Parvaneh and Patrick's two daughters, Sepideh and Nasanin, while she practices driving. He also begins to bond with his new cat. He repairs a bike he confiscated from a neighborhood teen, Adrian, and delivers it to the teen at his job at a kebab shop, where he meets Mirsad, another young man. Ove first mocks Mirsad over his eye makeup, and asks him if he is "one of those gays," but has no problem with that when Mirsad admits that he is.  Despite his improved relations with his neighbors, Ove has an altercation with two "Whiteshirts" who are attempting to force Rune into a nursing home. Ove then tries to commit suicide using a shotgun, but is interrupted by Adrian and Mirsad ringing his doorbell. Adrian says Mirsad had been kicked out of his house after [[coming out]] to his family and needs a place to stay. Ove gruffly invites Mirsad in. Later, Ove opens up to Parvaneh about Sonja. When Sonja was pregnant, she wanted to go on a vacation before the baby arrived. They traveled on a tour bus to Spain, and when they were returning home over a windy road, the bus crashed. Sonja lost the baby and was confined to a wheelchair. When the local authorities ignored Ove's pleas to build a wheelchair ramp, he went to the school in the night and built it himself.  Ove collapses and is taken to the hospital, where he lists Parvaneh as his next of kin. Parvaneh is told that her "father" is suffering from an enlarged heart but will survive. Laughing, she tells Ove he is terrible at dying, before suddenly going into labor and delivering a boy. Ove gives gifts to Parvaneh's daughters, who refer to him as grandpa. Several months later, Parvaneh and Patrick find Ove has died. The neighborhood packs the church for his funeral.

The Manny
 Single father Clemens ([[Matthias Schweighöfer]]) is shunned by all nanny services, because his two children Winnie and Theo (Paula Hartmann and Arved Friese) are impossible to babysit: they prank, bully and terrify any lady who dares to enter their mansion. But finding a nanny is hardly Clemens' number one priority, being preoccupied by his urban development which requires the demolition of an apartment building, something bitterly opposed by its residents. One of the victims, Rolf (Milan Peschel), pays Clemens a visit to voice his protest, but is mistaken as the new nanny — or manny in his case. Rolf believes it a good opportunity to sabotage Clemens' development plans, and accepts the offer. Predictably he suffers at the hands of the unruly children, but over time wins their hearts with his goofiness and sincerity. He discovers that the root of the kids' problems is that Clemens is never home. To help bring the family together, Rolf tries to show Clemens — including taking Clemens to visit his small community — that there are things more important than money in the world.  
The Marine 4: Moving Target
 Jake Carter ([[Mike Mizanin]]), a former U.S Marine, is now working at Hawthorne Global Security, a private security agency led by Robert Daniels ([[Craig Veroni]]). He and a few other men are waiting at the airport for the arrival of whistleblower Olivia "Liv" Tanis ([[Melissa Roxburgh]]), an IT engineer who used to work for Genesis Defense Corporation, one of the largest defense contractors of the United States. Liv's got intel on traitors inside Genesis and they've been hired by the Department of Justice to protect Liv until she takes official custody.  While they are en route for Liv's custody, their convoy is ambushed by a group of mercenaries hired by the corrupt military on Genesis, led by Simon Vogel (Josh Blacker). The mercenaries manage to kill Daniels and his men except for Jake, who takes Liv and manages to escape and outrun the mercenaries by stealing their car. The duo head to the safe house.  Once there, Liv grabs Jake's gun and says that she needs Jake's keys to go to the police station. Learning that one of the convoy might be a renegade, Jake is mistrusted because she doesn't know him but Jake asserts that if she goes alone, she will be ambushed. Jake convinces her that he is a former marine. Later, Nathan Miller ([[Roark Critchlow]]) and Ethan Smith (Matthew MacCaull), members of the Department of Justice, arrive at the safe house. Ethan suddenly shoots Nathan in the head after he tells the information of Simon Vogel and the incident. Ethan turns out to be working with Vogel. He then searches for Liv while putting Jake on gunpoint. Liv escapes the house as the alarm goes off, and Ethan is distracted, causing Jake and Ethan to fight. Whilst fighting, the group of mercenaries arrive at the house. Liv and Jake manage to outrun them using a boat.  After departing from the boat, they walk beside the stream, planning the next move. Liv still mistrusts Jake, so Jake states that the rebels will not stop until they manage to kill Liv. Still not convinced, Liv hits Jake on the head with a rock, knocking Jake out. Liv runs to the highway and hitchhikes a trailer truck to go to the nearest police station. Meanwhile, Jake recovers and follows the trail left by Liv. Jake sees a passing police car, which helps him locate the police station, where Liv is heading to.   At the police station, Liv complains that rebels are trying to kill her and is taken in custody. Shortly, Jake arrives at the police station and demands where she is. The police detective, Det. Paul Redman ([[Paul McGillion]]), who's trying to verify Jake's identity turns out to be talking to Ethan on the phone without knowledge of him working with the rebels, who tells him to keep Jake and Liv, both in custody till he arrives. The officers arrest both Jake and Liv. Ethan and the rebels arrive there. He goes inside the police station first, followed by an attack by the rebels, for which he was totally unprepared for. They then proceed to engage in a gunfight with the surviving officers. Jake and Liv obtain keys to the handcuffs from a dead officer. Jake then puts her somewhere safe and joins the gunfight. The four remaining officers including Redman are killed while trying to escape. The two manage to run from them but the rebels see them escape, ensuing a chase. The duo soon lose them, yet again.   Jake and Liv spend all night staying in the woods. The next morning, Jake calls Vogel on his phone upon their arriving at the woods. A shootout begins, killing most of the rebels including their sniper Dawes ([[Summer Rae]]) thanks to the assist of some traps made by Jake. In the ensuing chaos, Ethan holds Liv captive but the latter breaks free, allowing Jake and Ethan to fight. As Ethan gains the upper hand, Liv shoots him in the head. Suddenly, Vogel shoots Jake in the shoulder, temporarily stunning him. Unbeknownst to Vogel, Liv was able to find enough signal and finishes uploading the information of the corrupt military team to a dozen of news sites. Vogel then hits her. Jake, now recovered, tackles Vogel, snaps his neck, and kills him.  A few days later, Liv states that six members of the Genesis Defense Corporation are being indicted by treason and conspiracy. Liv gives a brand new tuxedo to Jake due to Jake losing his previous one earlier. Liv kisses Jake and boards the plane nearby. Jake watches as the plane flies away.

The night of his arrival, Robbie sneaks out of the house and goes to a local convenience store. There, he sees a young girl, Rina, sitting in a car. When he talks to her, Rina's boyfriend Bo harasses and punches Robbie in the face.  The next day at school, Robbie finds himself again harassed and embarrassed by Bo, who pushes him into the girls' restroom. At lunch, Robbie meets his first friend, Lenny, who sees the black eye and suggests that Robbie should learn self-defense or it will be the longest two months of his life. When Cindy invites him to lunch at her local restaurant, they are confronted by a thug. When Robbie confronts the thug verbally, the thug pulls out a knife. Cindy takes on the thug and uses martial arts to stop him. The police arrive and Robbie, in a state of shock, asks Cindy where she learned martial arts.  The following day, Robbie goes to the Space Coast Dojo, which is run by Glen. Robbie asks Glen to teach him martial arts and at first Glen refuses but then asks why. Robbie tells Glen that he is tired of being the person he has become and wants to do something about it. Glen takes Robbie in as a student and Robbie begins to change slowly. When Glen takes Robbie to a local bike shop to buy one for Robbie, Glen takes on a bully harassing the bike shop owner, who turns out to be Rina's father.  On his first bike ride, Robbie finds another local school, Dojo Extreme. There, he meets Coach Laurent Kaine, who unlike Glen believes that martial arts are for winning and destroying opponents. Robbie also learns that Bo is a student of Kaine's and leaves. Robbie continues his training with Glen and Cindy and begins to slowly change his ways. He becomes more friendly and begins to respect Glen and Cindy as if they were his real parents. Robbie even gets a job at the bike shop under the condition that he can attempt to steal Rina away from Bo. When Bo finds Robbie one day, he starts his verbal attack on Robbie but this time, Robbie doesn't budge. Glen, worried something dangerous happens, goes to Dojo Extreme to talk to Kaine. Kaine and Glen used to be friends, but their opposing views of martial arts have them rivals. When Kaine learns that Bo was the one who has been bullying Robbie, he tells Glen there's not much he can do because Bo's father has a lot of pull in town.  At a Halloween party, Robbie finally admits his feelings for Rina, who has been stood up by Bo so he can go off with his friends. The next day at the Space Coast Dojo, Rina finally reciprocates her feelings towards Robbie and the two become a couple, much to the chagrin of Bo. Meanwhile, Lenny is harassed by a trio of goons at the beach only to be rescued by Cindy. Cindy takes Lenny to the dojo and asks Robbie to teach him martial arts. When Robbie tells Lenny that martial arts is about protecting himself and others, Lenny agrees. Meanwhile, at Dojo Extreme, Kaine's obsession with his style forces his girlfriend Nika, to get upset and attempts to use a newcomer at the gym, Derek, to face Kaine. When Kaine uses his "assess, assert, and dismember" method, he breaks Derek's leg and apologizes to Nika.   When Rina calls Robbie and tells him that Bo has found her and has hurt her, Robbie flies into a rampage. He finds a bunch of Bo's friends to demand where he is and when they try to fight him, Robbie gets the upper hand. At a local pizza parlor, someone makes a viral video of Robbie fighting more of the Dojo Extreme team and it is uploaded for everyone to see. Robbie heads to Dojo Extreme and finds himself outnumbered by Kaine, Bo, and the rest of the dojo. However, Dojo Extreme learns that Robbie didn't come alone. Glen, Cindy, Lenny, and members of the Space Coast Dojo arrive. Robbie and Bo fight inside of a cage while the two schools go at it. When one of Dojo Extreme's members pulls out a gun, Cindy stops him in time and declares the rumble over. Glen follows Kaine to a baseball cage, where the two begin to fight. Meanwhile, Robbie finally defeats Bo using a grappling move. He celebrates his victory with a backflip and a loud 'kiai'. Meanwhile, Glen and Kaine fight in the cage with baseballs flying at them and then with baseball bats. Glen finally knocks Laurent down and tells him it is over. Kaine soon realizes that everyone does have something to learn.   Two weeks later, Glen, Cindy, Katie (Glen and Cindy's daughter), Robbie, Rina, and Lenny are at the beach when they are being watched. The man watching them from afar is Frank Whitlaw, Bo's father, who vows to get even with the Space Coast Dojo.  
Massu Engira Masilamani
  The film starts with the murder of a former Police Commissioner, Shanmuga Sundaram ([[Subbu Panchu]]) by an escaped prisoner Kamal Ekambaram ([[Riyaz Khan]]). The story then shifts to Masilamani aka Massu ([[Suriya]]) and his friend Jet Li aka Jettu ([[Premgi Amaren]]) who are small-time [[con artist]]s. Massu meets Manini ([[Nayantara]]), a nurse and they subsequently fall in love. While trying to escape after a heist gone wrong, Massu and Jet meet with a car accident, post which Massu starts seeing dead people, with whom he can communicate. Jettu had died in the accident and is now a ghost, too. Massu forms a group of loitering ghosts to earn money by performing fake exorcisms and extorting money from scared rich people, while promising the ghosts that he would fulfill their last wishes in return. Meanwhile, Manini who thought Massu was working in a finance company gets to know about the fake exorcisms and leaves him in a heist.  One day he meets a ghost called Shakthi (also Suriya), a [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] and look-alike of Massu. Shakthi initially seems to help Massu to pull off a large heist. However, he wants to use Massu for his own needs. He sabotages the plan and tricks Massu into running over Anthony ([[Sharath Lohitashwa]]), a [[hawala]] broker. Corrupt Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Vikram Lakshman ([[Parthiban]]) takes charge to investigate the case and finds out that Massu is, somehow involved in the murder. Meanwhile, the ghosts start striking against Massu as they assume that he would cheat them. Massu yells at them and orders them to go out. Just then, Shakti arrives as the ghosts have called him. The ghosts go with Shakthi. But Jettu manages to convince Massu and he agrees to fulfill the wishes of the ghosts. He starts fulfilling the wishes of all the ghosts. He first fulfills the wish of the ghost of a woman, Padma which is to see her son, who is actually blind. Massu is frustrated to learn that he is accidentally responsible for the death of Padma. As a sort of seeking forgiveness, he guides her son, takes care of him and gets his eye operated upon. Her wish fulfilled, Padma attains salvation. This incident moves Massu and he fulfills the wish of every ghost. Meanwhile, Shakthi manages to use Massu to kill another person, Madhivadhanan aka Madhi, an MLA and associate of Anthony. While Massu is furious with Shakthi for having made him a double murderer, Kamal meets Massu and starts telling him Shakthi's past: Massu is Shakthi's son.  Shakthi was a police officer in [[Quebec City]], [[Canada]]. He got married to Anuradha aka Anu ([[Pranitha Subhash]]), who is a teacher of his daughter Megha's school, just for Megha's wish. Shakthi secretly learns that Anu really loves and takes care of Megha. Anu & Shakthi fall in love. Anu gives birth to a son. Anu owned land in India, which she wanted to donate to an orphanage so that a new orphanage could be built there. Kamal was the only friend of Anu in India and agreed to help with the registration. Sakthi and Anu, along with their little daughter Megha ([[Yuvina Parthavi]]) and infant Massu, came to India to complete the registration but get to know that industrialists Radha Krishnan ([[Samuthirakani]]) and Anthony forged documents and planned to take the land away to construct flats there. Since Shakthi remained undeterred and did not give way, Radha Krishnan, Anthony and their henchman Madhi and Shanmuga Sundaram, killed Shakthi, Anu and Megha and pinned the murders on Kamal. Massu had escaped because Megha had left him safe in a small house with a family nearby.  Shakthi through Massu wanted to kill all the people who were responsible for his family's demise. Knowing the truth, Massu decides to kill the last person, Radha Krishnan, himself. Radha Krishnan also knows who Massu is and tries to kill him but Kamal saves Massu. However, because he was hit on the head by Radha Krishnan, he loses the ability to see and converse with the spirits anymore. With the help of Vikram, who double-crossed Radha Krishnan, Massu finally kills Radha Krishnan. As Shakthi's last wish is fulfilled, he goes to heaven and joins with Anu and Megha. Manini now reunites with Massu and they get married as Jettu remains with Massu forever.  
The Martian (film)
 In 2035, the crew of the Ares III [[human mission to Mars|mission to Mars]] is exploring [[Acidalia Planitia]] on [[Timekeeping on Mars#Sols|Martian solar day (sol)]]&nbsp;18 of their 31-sol expedition.  A strong [[Martian storm|dust storm]] threatens to topple their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), forcing them to abort their mission. During the evacuation, astronaut Mark Watney is struck by debris and lost in the storm, and [[telemetry]] from his suit's biomonitor stops. With Watney believed dead, the storm worsening by the second, and the MAV on the verge of toppling, mission commander Melissa Lewis orders the crew to take off and return to their orbiting vessel, the ''Hermes''.  Watney awakens after the storm to a low-oxygen warning and returns to the crew's surface habitat ("Hab"). Doing [[self-surgery]], he removes from his abdomen the debris that destroyed his biomonitor. He begins a video diary. Lacking communications with Earth, his only chance of rescue is via the next Mars mission, four years later: the Ares IV, landing  away at the [[Schiaparelli (Martian crater)|Schiaparelli crater]]. Watney's immediate concern is food; being a [[botany|botanist]], he improvises a farm inside the Hab utilizing [[Martian soil]] fertilized with human feces, water produced by extracting hydrogen from leftover rocket fuel, and [[potato]]es intended for [[Thanksgiving dinner]]. He also begins to modify the only functional [[rover (space exploration)|rover]] for longer journeys in preparation for the long-distance travel.  After [[NASA]] holds a funeral for Watney, satellite planner Mindy Park reviews images of the Hab area and realizes he has survived. NASA administrator Teddy Sanders has the news released, but despite the objections of the ''Hermes'' [[flight controller|flight director]] Mitch Henderson, decides not to "distract" the Ares III crew by informing them.  Watney takes the rover to retrieve the nearby [[Mars Pathfinder|''Pathfinder'']] probe, which fell silent in 1997. Using ''Pathfinder''s camera and its motor, he establishes rudimentary two-way communication with Earth, first using simple signs, and then sending and receiving [[ASCII]] in [[hexadecimal]]. NASA sends a [[patch (computing)|software patch]] to link the rover with ''Pathfinder'' and communicate via text. Watney becomes angry when he learns that the crew has not been told of his survival, and Sanders reluctantly lets Henderson finally inform them.  Henderson and [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) director Bruce Ng prepare an Iris [[space probe]] to deliver enough food to last Watney until Ares IV's arrival. Meanwhile the Hab's airlock malfunctions due to a small puncture, destroying Watney's crops. Sanders orders the team to skip the usual safety inspections to launch the probe sooner, but it fails 40 seconds after liftoff. Watney now feels his death is inevitable.  The [[China National Space Administration]] has been developing a powerful classified [[booster (rocketry)|booster]] rocket, the ''Taiyang Shen''. Feeling camaraderie with NASA's scientists, they violate their government's secrecy and offer it to repeat the Iris mission. As Watney is still at more risk the longer he waits, JPL [[astrodynamicist]] Rich Purnell devises an alternative plan: send the ''Taiyang Shen'' with supplies to the ''Hermes'', which will [[gravity assist|use Earth's gravity to "slingshot"]] back to Mars two years earlier. Sanders rejects the idea, refusing to risk the crew on ''Hermes'', but Henderson surreptitiously sends them Purnell's plan. Risking their lives and careers, they vote unanimously for it, and make the necessary course change. Powerless to stop them, NASA concedes the issue.  Watney begins the 90-sol journey to Schiaparelli, where the MAV for Ares IV has been pre-positioned, but it needs to be lightened to make the [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] with ''Hermes'' on its new course. Watney must remove many components,  and replace the [[nose cone]] with a piece of the Hab's canvas. The MAV still fails to reach the required speed, so Commander Lewis [[orbital maneuver|maneuvers]] ''Hermes'', consuming most of its available fuel, then ordering a [[Newton's Laws of Motion|directional explosive decompression]] of the internal atmosphere. Finally she uses a [[Manned Maneuvering Unit]], but still cannot quite reach Watney. He pierces the glove of his pressure suit and uses the escaping air to propel himself towards Lewis, effectively reuniting him with his crew after 560 sols alone on Mars.  After returning to Earth, Watney becomes a survival instructor for astronaut candidates. Five years later, on the occasion of the Ares V mission launch, those involved in Watney's rescue have begun new lives.

Masaan
 Set in present-day [[Varanasi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]], the plot of ''Masaan'' follows two seemingly separate stories that converge eventually.<ref name=variety></ref>  The first of these tells the story of college student Devi Pathak ([[Richa Chadda]]). The film opens with her and her fellow student, Piyush Aggarwal, checking into a hotel room. They are interrupted during sex when policemen burst in, having been tipped off by hotel staff who suspected Devi and Piyush were indulging in “indecent behaviour”. Inspector Mishra (Bhagwan Tiwari) records the barely clad Devi on his mobile phone while Piyush locks himself in the bathroom and commits suicide by slitting his wrists. Devi and her father Vidyadhar ([[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]]) are subjected to blackmail by Inspector Mishra, who demands a hefty bribe of three lakhs to hush up the matter. In desperate need of money, Vidyadhar begins to indulge in a betting game, where people bet on small boys to dive and collect the maximum number of coins from the [[Ganges]] riverbed within a specified time. He lets people bet on Jhonta (Nikhil Sahni), an orphan, that works for him after Jhonta volunteers himself for the game. Meanwhile, Devi has to switch jobs due to the stigma associated with her having pre-marital sex. She eventually gets a government job in the railways in Varanasi, but news regarding her pre-marital sexual indulgence reaches there as well.  The second narrative concerns Deepak Kumar ([[Vicky Kaushal]]), a Varanasi boy from the [[Domba|Dom]] community whose family works in [[Ghats in Varanasi|cremation ghats]] by burning funeral pyres. Deepak wants to transcend the restrictions of a casteist society. He studies civil engineering at a polytechnic college where he meets and falls in love with Shaalu Gupta ([[Shweta Tripathi]]), a high caste Hindu  girl. They start meeting each other and during a trip to [[Allahabad]] on the banks of the Ganges, they share an intimate moment. Back in Varanasi, Deepak tells her about his caste and the work he does burning corpses. Shaalu remains firm and tells him that she will be with him even if her parents refuse. She asks him to focus on his placements and get a job, while she reaffirms her commitment to him.  However, unfortunately, during a pilgrimage trip with her family, Shaalu dies in a ghastly bus accident. Her body with those of other victims ends up at the same cremation ground where Deepak's family works. Deepak is shattered on seeing her dead body and loses all purpose in his life. He retains her ring as a souvenir. Deepak is eventually able to overcome his grief and discards Shaalu's ring in the Ganges. He gains a placement as a civil engineer in Allahabad. Later that same ring is picked up by Jhonta who loses consciousness underwater while collecting coins. He regains consciousness in hospital and gives the ring to a remorseful Vidyadhar, who decides to stop playing with Jhonta's life. He sells the ring and is finally able to pay off Inspector Mishra.  Marred by the parochial mindset of people regarding her situation, Devi leaves Varanasi and joins a course in Allahabad. She comes to the banks of the Ganges to immerse the gift Piyush had given to her on that fateful day in the hotel. Deepak, who was also sitting by the bank, notices her crying and offers her water to drink. A boatman beckons, offering both of them a ride towards [[Triveni Sangam#Triveni Sangam at Allahabad|Sangam]]. They both board the boat and strike up a conversation.

Meanwhile, Anna is taken to a pit outside and buried alive but she digs her way into a drainage ditch and escapes. She fights her way back into the underground facility, killing several cabal members. She frees Sam and tells her to run for help.

Anna gets stabbed in the side by one of the cabals before shooting him.  Anna finds and interrupts an assembly gathered to watch Lucie die on a cross. Lucie gets a look in her eyes that the group feels signifies martyrdom and Anna, wielding Fenton's gun, insists that Lucie be freed. Lucie reveals what she saw in a whisper to Anna. Eleanor demands to know what Lucie said; the priest says he heard Lucie's whispers before quickly putting a gun in his mouth and killing himself. Anna shoots Eleanor and the rest of the cabal members flee. Anna embraces Lucie as they lie dying on the floor. With the police on their way, both women's eyes glaze over with the look of martyrdom.

He learns that a fellow student and former childhood friend of his, Rachel Kushner ([[Olivia Cooke]]), has been diagnosed with [[leukemia]] and is forced by his parents ([[Nick Offerman]] and [[Connie Britton]]) to befriend her in her time of need. Despite an extremely awkward first encounter on Rachel’s staircase, neither of them truly wanting the other's company until Greg manages to strike up a conversation about her pillow collection. She finds his quirky personality endearing and they make plans to meet on a regular basis.  Over time, Greg introduces Rachel to his longtime co-worker Earl ([[RJ Cyler]]), in a visit to Rachel before she loses her hair to treatment, with whom he makes short films parodying famous film titles. At Greg's reluctance, Earl convinces Greg to share their collection of short films with her, which she finds entertaining. As Rachel begins [[chemotherapy]], her disease worsens, and Greg begins spending less time at school and more time with and caring for her.  Discovering them shooting another film, Madison ([[Katherine C. Hughes]]), Greg's crush, convinces Greg and Earl to make a film dedicated to Rachel, and Rachel persuades Greg to apply to a local college. Despite being accepted by the college, Greg continues to ignore schoolwork, and eventually school altogether, in order to finish the film. After realizing that her chemotherapy is doing more harm than good, Rachel opts to discontinue her treatment. Greg and Rachel have a heated argument over her choice where she points out his unwillingness to do anything selfless unless he's told to do so. He leaves, devastated that he can no longer help her.  In a rage, Greg confronts Earl, blaming him for the events leading to the end of his friendship with Rachel, with Earl admonishing Greg's inability to care and sympathize for anyone but himself despite the genuine affection she gave him. Afterward, Earl gives Greg a heartfelt testimonial for Rachel before letting him know that he's finished with their friendship. Greg is also told that due to his failing grades, he has been rejected by the college he thought he would attend.  Later in the year, Greg's mom lets him know that Rachel has been moved into a hospice, which Greg originally believes to be for more treatment, before learning that she is in hospital to die, which only depresses him further. Taking pity on him, Madison invites him to the prom. However, after dressing up in a tuxedo, he decides not to go to pick up Madison but instead goes to the hospital where Rachel is receiving hospice care. During the journey to the hospital, Greg is asked by the limo driver if he loves Rachel, a question he finds himself unable to answer. To the hospital, he brings his iPhone and a portable projector and places a corsage around Rachel’s wrist before running the film he made for Rachel on the front wall of her room, lying beside her as they did when they watched his other films.

Greg finds a card to him from her explaining that she wrote a letter to the college Greg applied to in order to let them know that he missed school for her sake. She explains through the letter that she sent to the college that Greg was the kindest and most caring person she had ever met after stating “No one has done more to make me smile than he has. And no one ever could.” Greg also finds several intricate carvings within her books depicting scenes of her with Greg and Earl, proving that she still cared for him. Greg leaves with one of the books containing a personal carving and his favorite of Rachel's pillows.  Some time later, Greg writes his story of his time with Rachel (which is the basis for the film's narrative) and mails it to the college along with the film he made for her.

  Vasanth ([[Aari (actor)|Aari]]) is an artist who is working on a story about 'Mayavanam', a haunted forest. On his  friend's birthday, he tells a story involving 'Maya', a malevolent spirit. He tells him about how one experiences chills and witnesses a spirit descending on them when one says "Maya! your daughter is not with me" three times. In order to ridicule Vasanth, the friend says the same three times, and a similar figure enters the room. He falls back in fear, but the figure reveals itself as his wife; it's just a birthday surprise. The next day, Vasanth shows the pictures taken by him during the dressed up Maya's entry to his boss, Ram Prasad ([[Amzath Khan]]) and Madan ([[Utay Mahesh]]), the episode writer on Mayavanam. Ram points out a smoky form near them and warns him of it. He tells him about a book, ''Asylum by Kate'', that details the life of the mentally ill who were forced into asylums and experimented upon. Madhan then recounts the story of one such inmate, a woman named Maya Matthews, who was taken to the asylum after murdering her husband and forced to give up her newborn daughter to the authorities in the [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]]. She falls to her death from the building, with an expensive ring rumoured to be on her body, and is buried in the grounds of the asylum (Mayavanam), where it is believed her vengeful spirit now roams. Later, Madhan and Vasanth's friend—an auto driver—visits Mayavanam to write about his last episode. Madhan disappears, and after escaping from Mayavanam somehow, Vasanth's friend meets with a grisly death soon, by falling off the building just like Maya, which spurs Vasanth to embark on an investigation into Mayavanam.  In alternating scenes, Apsara ([[Nayantara]]) is a single mother struggling to make ends meet by working in ad films. She is separated from her husband Arjun who is an actor, and lives with her friend Swathi ([[Lakshmi Priyaa Chandramouli]]) who works at a film production house, RK Studios. After a poster of the film, Irul, that Swathi is currently working on is put on to the walls of the house, Apsara experiences strange things happening inside the house. She doesn't give much thought to it because she is always preoccupied by the loan that she has taken from a local gangster. He keeps visiting her house demanding cash and she keeps putting it off by saying that the cheque she has been entitled to, after acting in another ad film previously, keeps bouncing off. In frustration, she goes to visit the ad company where she learns that the producer has gone to take part in the contest arranged by Swathi's company. The contest is a promotional ad for Irul, in which contestants are awarded ₹5 lakh if they succeed in watching the horror film alone at night without showing signs of fright. She catches an auto and goes to the studio. The scenes are alternated with Vasanth going to Mayavanam and the ad film producer watching the film. By the time she reaches the studio, the producer is dead and is taken on a stretcher towards the ambulance. The director of Irul had witnessed the bizarre death of the ad film producer while watching the film, but claimed to the police it was a heart attack.  All lost and her being emotionally tortured by the money lender, Apsara decides to watch Irul, to make ends meet. Swathi begs her not to, fearing for Apsara's life and in hope of the director backing her up, she appeals to him too, but the director supports Apsara even though he knows what could happen later on. The film starts to play, and it is revealed that Vasanth's side of story is the film Irul. As Apsara continues to watch, she is inexplicably teleported into the film. Ram and Kate, the author, is shown to make a man dig into the grounds of Mayavanam, searching for the expensive ring that Maya was said that died with. Vasanth gets caught by Kate and is held at gun point while they search for the ring. Apsara gets caught too, and when they eventually find Maya's coffin, a figure is seen to appear behind Kate and Ram, and all hell breaks loose. Soon Apsara and Vasanth get separated from the group, and are chased by the ghost. They fall into a big ditch and Vasanth helps her out, while he stays in. She runs away and hears a baby's cry. She goes in search of it, when she gets shot by Shankar. After falling down, she is held by Maya who cries out in bitter rage and kills Shankar. It is then revealed that Maya is Apsara's mother. She wakes up in the theatre, with her mother's diary on her lap, and the doll she used to play with, when she was a baby. It is later revealed that the person who played Vasanth in the film is Arjun himself and producer of the ad film who died earlier, was the one who sent Maya to the asylum and took her ring.  The final scene shows Apsara reunited with her husband and now acting in a film about Maya directed by the same director as Irul. As the shooting starts, the first scene being Maya sitting in a wheelchair, Arjun finds Apsara standing in a corner while everyone was assuming that she was the one sitting in the wheelchair. The film ends with the spirit Maya killing the director and Maya's ring falling out of his pocket. After that Maya turns back and the screen cuts black.  
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials
  The film begins with a flashback to a young boy, Thomas, being dropped off by his mother and taken in by scientist Ava Paige and troops of the organization called WCKD, along with other abandoned children. WCKD places the children in a walled maze in a glade as part of its scientific testing. Years later, shortly after being rescued from the Maze, Thomas and the remaining Gladers&nbsp;– Teresa Agnes, Newt, Minho, Frypan, and Winston&nbsp;– are taken to a facility run by Mr. Janson. He explains that the facility is a safe haven, protecting them from WCKD, the Flare virus and the "Cranks", and provides them clothes, food, and sanitation, where other survivors of multiple mazes are also present. Thomas becomes curious about their activities and manages to find out what is really happening behind the closed doors. With help from Aris, the first maze survivor to end up in the facility, Thomas discovers that WCKD's leader, Ava, is still alive and that Mr. Janson is really working for WCKD, when they discuss experiments on the Immunes and that Janson has yet to find the Right Arm, a resistance group located in the mountains. The group, including Aris, escapes the facility, and Janson orders his WCKD troops to track them down, as they find themselves in the deserted outside world – the Scorch.  The group arrive at an abandoned marketplace, where they first encounter the Cranks, humans zombified by the Flare virus. In the process, Winston gets infected by one of them. When morning comes, they find the remains of the city in ruins and that WCKD is still searching for them. Winston's infection gets worse, forcing the rest of the group to leave him alone to die by shooting himself, preventing his transformation. The group continues to venture the desert until one night, while sleeping, Thomas wakes to discover a civilization off in the distance. As a thunderstorm emerges, they run to an abandoned facility to take shelter. Minho gets struck by the lightning on the way but survives. They manage to enter the place, only to find out that the facility was filled with chained Cranks. The group meets Brenda and Jorge, who leads a dangerous band of survivors and have used the Cranks as their own guard dogs. When the two find that the group had come from WCKD and is also looking for the Right Arm resistance, the two agree to take them to the Right Arm, abandoning their group of survivors. Moments later, WCKD, led by Janson, storms the place, only for the facility to be destroyed by Jorge's explosives, however, Thomas and Brenda are left behind, as the rest have escaped with Jorge. Thomas and Brenda manage to escape the Cranks, only for Brenda to get infected by a Crank in the process. Thomas experiences a flashback of when he and Teresa were formerly working for WCKD, in which Thomas tries to warn Teresa of WCKD's plans, only for the two to be separated by WCKD's troops. As Thomas and Brenda reunite with the rest of the group, Jorge interrogates Marcus, a survivor who secretly works for WCKD, into revealing the whereabouts of The Right Arm.  The group eventually arrive at The Right Arm's outpost relief camps, where other innocent survivors are present, and are greeted by Vince, who leads the Right Arm and is in charge of deciding whether they can stay or not. As Brenda's infection gets worse, Vince threatens to shoot Brenda, only to be stopped by Mary Cooper, a former WCKD scientist who reveals that Thomas was their informant, which also helped the Right Arm in taking down WCKD's illegal major operations ever since. As Mary halts Brenda's infection using an enzyme cure, Mary explains that the enzyme can only be harvested from an Immune's body, not manufactured, and that arguments over the methods of manufacturing the cure with Ava led to Mary's departure from WCKD. That evening, Teresa tells WCKD of her location, believing that WCKD's motivations are good, leading to an ambush by WCKD. Ava and Janson arrive and confront the Right Arm before WCKD troops capture survivors for experimentation, including Minho, Sonya and Aris, while Janson shoots Mary dead. After Thomas and the Right Arm fend the WCKD troops off, Ava, Janson and Teresa retreat with their captured survivors. With only a fraction of survivors left at the site, Thomas plans an infiltration into WCKD and is determined to take them down to save his friends and save civilization, as his friends and the Right Arm agree to help and prepare to fight back.

At a dinner with Marco at the home of Sergio and his new family, while the two men talk with great enthusiasm of fishing, she slips out and goes to Marina's place. Marina, who feels she is finally over Federica, doesn't want to invite her in, so the two have a confrontation on the doorstep. Federica is now sure it is the relationship with Marina that she wants, but Marina, after detailing the awful way Federica has treated her, asks for six months to figure out whether she can try again.  Federica understands and accepts this, but when she leaves, Marina suddenly changes her mind and, running down several flights of stairs, tells Federica that six months is too long. The two share a passionate kiss.  
Me and My Mates vs the Zombie Apocalypse
 After the zombie apocalypse occurs in Australia, two tradesmen, Darryl (Alex Williamson) and Joel ([[Jim Jefferies (comedian)|Jim Jefferies]]), meet at a telephone exchange tower to take refuge there. Joel shows Darryl that their friend Roy’s ([[Greg Fleet]]) undead wife (Jackie Murray) is in the back of his ute, which prevents them from retrieving their beer. After an argument Darryl is forced to shoot Roy’s wife in the head. Their older friend Roy meets the two there with his daughter Emma (Adele Vuko), and Darryl proceeds to poorly flirt with Emma, much to Roy's dismay.  After discussion about their plans to survive, Joel decides to fix the 3G tower to make an emergency call to the military to alert them of their location. While waiting for the tower to get fixed, Emma and Darryl become intimate, during which a firework goes off in the distance and the zombies surrounding their location migrate. At this point two strangers wearing [[paintball]]ing gear enter the tower; they are revealed to be the apprentices Ryan (Matt Popp) and Lachlan ([[Andy Trieu]]), who is Emma’s boyfriend. Joel fixes the phone line and talks with the military. Meanwhile, the apprentices tell the other guys that the military caused the zombie apocalypse and that calling them is the last thing they should do. The team argues and decides to split up: Joel, Roy and Darryl wish to get picked up by the military and Ryan, Lachlan and Emma decide to hide in case the military are in fact malicious. Roy begins to show symptoms that he is infected.  The military jeep drives past and misses the tower. Joel goes to the roof to launch fireworks to catch the military's attention, but is killed when he accidentally ignites the entire pile of fireworks.  Two soldiers arrive but, confused by Roy’s poor wording of the situation, are eaten by the hoard of zombies.  A zombie picks up Joel’s access card from his severed leg. The team decides to make a dash for the military’s weapons and vehicle, but the zombie that grabbed the access card opens the building and the hoard begins to move in. The apprentices make a dash to drive off the hoard while Emma runs to the senior soldier’s corpse to retrieve his car keys. She starts the car and grabs the apprentices, Lachlan spraining his ankle running to the car.  Darryl admits to Roy that he slept with his daughter.  Roy radios Emma to tell her to leave him and Darryl to die, and to set off a flare once her and the apprentices are safe.  At this point Darryl admits to Roy that he shot his wife. Roy and Darryl decide that Roy gets to Darryl on account of killing his wife and having sex with his daughter in the same afternoon. Darryl defuses the situation by showing Roy the grenade he found.  They use the grenade to blow up the zombies chasing them.  As the sun rises, they see another hoard coming towards them.  The two have one last smoke before fighting and ultimately being over run by the zombies. As they lie dying they see the flare Roy instructed Emma to set off once she was far away.  
Mega Shark vs. Kolossus
 Some time after the events of the [[Mega Shark Versus Mecha Shark|previous film]], the world's governments institute preparation plans in case another Mega Shark appears; another shark is awakened by Russian miners drilling underwater for [[red mercury]]. Meanwhile, a team of prospectors led by a man named Benedict searching for red mercury at the behest of an unknown sponsor enter a mine in Russia, where they discover a secret stock of the substance. One of Benedict's team is unmasked as American agent Moira King ([[Amy Rider]]), but while a standoff between King and the Russians occurs, a [[Mecha|giant robot]] hidden beneath the mine reawakens. King barely escapes while the robot, Kolossus, destroys the mine.  Dr. Alison Gray ([[Illeana Douglas]]) proposes to the military the use of her newly developed sonic transmitters, which she believes can influence the shark's behavior, but is rejected in favor of a more aggressive plan laid out by her colleague John Bullock ([[Jeff Hatch]]). She is then summoned by tech mogul and [[environmentalist]] Joshua Dane ([[Brody Hutzler]]), CEO of DaneTech Industries, who is aware of the government's plans thanks to his infiltrating their communications out of distrust for their intentions. Dane suggests that they work together to stop the shark in a more humane fashion and protect the environment. Elsewhere, King recruits desk worker Spencer (Edward DeRuiter) to assist her in stopping Kolossus. Kolossus is discovered to be a mobile [[weapon of mass destruction]] created by the Russians during the [[Cold War]], powered by red mercury and capable of multiple detonations.  The fleet led by Admiral Jackson ([[Ernest Lee Thomas|Ernest Thomas]]) carries out an attack on the shark, but fails and Dr. Bullock is thrown overboard. Dane and Alison approach on Dane's [[hydrofoil]] and offer to assist using Alison's transmitter, but the pod malfunctions and the shark escapes. King and Spencer come across the battle and join forces with Dane and Alison to find Kolossus's creator, Sergei Abramov ([[Patrick Bauchau]]). When they locate Abramov, he gives them a compass and clues to where the technology to control Kolossus can be found. Kolossus arrives and detonates, killing Abramov while the others escape.  Following Abramov's clues, the group locates the laboratory where he created Kolossus, which is now underwater. However, the shark is nearby; as its rampage continues, Admiral Jackson suffers a breakdown and initiates a nuclear launch before committing suicide. Lieutenant Commader Parker (Tara Price) manages to override the order, aborting the strike, and King uses an American flag to draw the shark into the inlet where the laboratory is, trapping it. While King, Spencer, Alison and Dane search the laboratory for Kolossus's control device, however, the robot appears and begins fighting with the shark. They find the device and escape the lab just before the battle crushes it. Kolossus approaches Dane's ship, but they manage to connect the controller to Dane's computer system in time to stop it.  With Kolossus under control, Dane betrays the others, revealing that he was Benedict's sponsor and sabotaged Alison's transmitter to prevent the government from killing the shark before he could find red mercury. As he collects the red mercury from Kolossus, the shark attacks again, but he uses Kolossus to attach a transmitter to it, bringing the shark under his control as well. Dane broadcasts a message worldwide, announcing that he has control of both Mega Shark and Kolossus and plans to use Kolossus to destroy the cities that produce the most pollution, killing millions in the name of saving the environment. Several governments scramble fighter jets against him, but Dane uses Mega Shark and Kolossus to eliminate them. He then declares to the world that he expects a nuclear strike will come, warning that if he is killed it will trigger the release of red mercury into the atmosphere, rendering Earth inhospitable for centuries. The US activates the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] satellite, prompting Dane to have Kolossus throw the shark into space, knocking the satellite's laser off target so it hits the moon instead. Dane does not notice that when the shark lands back in the ocean, the transmitter falls off. The shark attacks Kolossus, causing Dane's control system to crash. Kolossus targets the ship; while Alison, King and Spencer - who escaped their bonds earlier - flee, Dane runs onto the beach and is crushed under Kolossus's foot.  Alison, King and Spencer watch from the shore as Mega Shark and Kolossus engage in a vicious final battle. Kolossus finally drags the shark down, wraps around it and detonates its entire remaining supply of red mercury, destroying both creatures. With the crisis over, the three survivors await rescue. Deep underwater, another egg hatches, giving birth to a new Mega Shark. In a [[post-credits scene]], Dr. Bullock is killed by the new shark.

When Seol-rang leaves, Deok-gi intones the prophecy that "You, no, not just you, but you and I both will be killed by Hong-ee."  Eighteen years later, Seol-rang, now called Wallso, is a blind woman with two children who manages a tea house at Byukran port. Determined to take revenge on Deok-gi, Wallso tries to teach Hong-ee to become a master of the sword, but Hong-ee (who changed her name to Seol-hee) is much more interested in day-to-day affairs than what happened to her father in the past.  One day, a big sword match hosted by the powerful military ruler Deok-gi (now known as Yoo-baek) is held in the market. Seol-hee participates in the match despite Wallso's objections. As the match progresses, she ends up fighting Yull, who is the master of the sword.  Yoo-baek realizes that Seol-hee's skill with the sword is similar to Seol-rang's, whom he had once loved. Yoo-baek orders his subordinates to catch Seol-hee, but she is able to run away. That same night, Seol-hee learns how her father, Poong-cheon died. Wallso tells her that there are two enemies that Seol-hee is destined to vanquish: Yoo-baek, and Wallso herself.

Midnight Garage
 A family of three moves to a housing complex currently under construction. The father parks their car on an empty space with an out-of-order sign in a nearby underground parking lot. During their visit to the construction site, a loose metal falls and crushes them. The film cuts to a group of friends who is about to watch a new film in a cinema. Interspersed with it is Lisa, an office worker who works at the office where the previous parking lot is located, going to work with her lover. The parking lot is managed by two security guards: the older, cowardly, and perverted Baozi and the younger, recently inducted, and superstitious Luokun. The two are warned not to remove the out-of-order sign because of the presence of a "ghost", though only Luokun really takes this seriously.  Lisa frequently has problems with starting her car in the parking lot and feels haunted by the ghosts of a young girl dressed in red and a white-clothed figure. During one such problem, Baozi checks through the lot further and comes into a dilapidated room. Upon encountering a pale woman and the girl, he suffers a heart attack and dies. His position is replaced by Shenyang, an even younger and naive individual. Meanwhile, Lisa and her lover encounter the woman and the girl during one night with Lisa's lover leaving her to her fate. She is saved by Luokun, who fends off with his spiritual experience. Lisa then gets a call informing her that her lover is killed in a car accident.  Enough with her experiences, Lisa decides to transfer to the company's branch in [[Hong Kong]]. She gives her car key to the guards upon being informed that parking near the sidewalk is forbidden, but to her horror finds out that her car is parked back at the underground parking lot. Escorted by Luokun, she is able to drive away but her car stops just as she is about to get outside. While waiting in the security room, she discovers wigs and a white dress, realizing that Luokun is pretending to be the ghost. He goes up and chains her to a bed, revealing their previous relationship at a hotel which Lisa has long since forgotten, saying that he will take revenge at her for abandoning and humiliating him. After Luokun fends off the woman and girl ghosts (revealed to be the mother and daughter killed in the prologue) and delivering them to their relatives, he has a cat-and-mouse chase with Lisa and manages to tie her back, but Shenyang arrives and has a deadly fight with Luokun in which he dies, giving Lisa time to escape. Lisa and Luokun continue their chase above until Luokun abruptly gets hit by a car.  It is revealed that most of the film's plot about Lisa and the security guards is a [[film within a film]] watched by the three friends introduced in the film's opening. Deciding that the film is mediocre, the three take their leave from the underground parking lot (in exactly the same place notified with the out-of-order sign) and go home, but are involved in a horrific car accident in which one of them has his head sliced off, while the other has his feet blown up and eventually crushed by an exploding manhole cover.  
The Messenger (2015 horror film)
 After his father's death, a suicide by hanging, young Jack seemingly gains the ability to see and talk with souls who have not yet "gone into the light." As Jack grows older, these souls ask him to become their 'Messenger' and relay their final words to those still living. This usually ends badly; as more often than naught Jack's words, though honest, cause more misery and result in him getting kicked out of funerals or beaten up. Jack states time and time again that he isn't doing it out of the goodness of his heart, but in an effort to get rid of the souls haunting him, which doesn't happen until the task is completed.  It's shown through countless, intermediate flashbacks that, as a child, Jack had been in and out of psychiatric clinics and hospitals all through adulthood, and as of the present, has been skimping on his prescribed medication. This, along the fact that he constantly drinks, has his current soul companion, a high-profile reporter by the name of Mark,worrying that his message to his recently widowed wife, Sarah, won't be genuinely received. Mark discloses that he was jumped on his way home by hooded figures and killed, staged to look like a successful suicide. He convinces Jack to reach out to his wife and tell her goodbye, while also revealing the fact that he knows about the baby growing inside her; this causes Sarah to become distressed, as the baby isn't Mark's. Jack, frustrated at how he's made the situation worse again, is taken into custody in response to Sarah's call to the police.  Jack is taken to see a psychiatrist and is made to retell his story, eventually discovering that his father hadn't killed himself because of his mother, but that he was projecting his own bitterness and hatred for her. Seconds after he accepts help, Mark returns and insists that Jack help Sarah, who is attempting suicide by overdose. Jack initially refuses but relents when it becomes too much, eventually screaming hysterically for everyone to send help. He's sedated and taken away, though in the end, Jack's warnings stand true and the emergency response saved Sarah's life. Though the psychiatrist refutes the idea that his powers are real, saying that it's his mind trying to cope with his father's violent death, both the constable and Jack's sister, Emma, begin to believe in his powers. Afterwards Emma brings Jack a crystallized bug globe, a memento of their father, and Jack finally moves on from his father's death, crying and accepting help.  During the story it is discovered that Jack's nephew, Billy, also sees lost souls, but has never told anyone. He discloses that he's haunted by the ghost of a boy who drowned in his family's swimming pool.

Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation
 After intercepting [[nerve gas]] being sold to [[insurgency in the North Caucasus|Chechen terrorists]] in [[Minsk]], [[Impossible Missions Force|IMF]] agent [[Ethan Hunt]] is determined to prove the existence of the Syndicate, a criminal consortium the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] does not believe exists. Hunt is captured by the Syndicate at a [[record shop]] in [[London]], while their leader, a blond man in glasses, kills the IMF agent stationed there. Hunt escapes a torture chamber led by Syndicate member Janik "Bone Doctor" Vinter with the help of disavowed [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent and Syndicate operative Ilsa Faust.   In [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Director]] Alan Hunley and IMF Field Operations Director William Brandt testify before [[United States congressional committee|a Senate committee]]. The IMF, currently without a secretary in charge, is controversial because of its [[Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol|destructive methods and other misconduct.]] Hunley succeeds in having the IMF disbanded and absorbed into the CIA. Brandt, knowing Hunley will try to capture Hunt, warns him to stay undercover. Cut off from the IMF, Hunt follows his only lead: the man in glasses, later identified as former MI6 agent Solomon Lane.  Six months later, Hunt, still a fugitive living in [[Paris]] (luring a CIA team to a decoy safe house in [[Havana]]), enlists former colleague [[Benji Dunn]] to attend [[Turandot|an opera]] in [[Vienna]], predicting that an assassination attempt will be made on the [[Chancellor of Austria|Austrian Chancellor]] at the performance, and that Lane will also be there. The two stop three snipers, including Faust, but the Chancellor is killed by a [[car bomb]], and Lane is still not found. Faust drops hints of Lane's plan to Hunt before leaving. Dunn stays with Hunt instead of reporting back to the CIA, despite knowing his action amounts to treason.  Hunt, blamed for the Chancellor's death, is pursued by the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]]. Brandt contacts [[Luther Stickell]] to find Hunt before the CIA does. Stickell tracks Hunt, Dunn, and Faust to [[Casablanca]], where they acquire a secret file from a secure building. Faust flees with the data, evading both Hunt and Syndicate members, although Hunt kills the pursuing agents. Dunn reveals he copied the data onto a second USB drive, as Stickell and Brandt catch up to them.  Faust returns to London and attempts to use the file to quit her mission to infiltrate the Syndicate, but her MI6 [[agent handler|handler]], Atlee, compels her to continue, whilst discreetly wiping her drive. Meanwhile, Ethan learns that the data is an encrypted British government [[Red box (government)|red box]] that requires the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]'s biometrics to unlock it. Lane's men abduct Dunn, and use Dunn and Faust to [[blackmail]] Hunt into decrypting the data and delivering it to them. Hunt agrees to the ultimatum, despite protests from Brandt.  As part of Hunt's plan, Brandt reveals their location to Hunley. At a London charity auction, Hunley, Brandt, and Atlee take the PM to a secure room to protect him from Hunt. Brandt has the PM confirm the existence of the Syndicate, a project proposed by Atlee to perform missions without oversight, effectively making the PM "judge, jury and executioner with zero accountability", before Atlee reveals himself as Hunt in a mask. When the real Atlee arrives, Hunt forces him to admit that he began the Syndicate without permission, and that he has been covering up its existence after Lane hijacked the project and went rogue, turning the Syndicate against him and MI6.  With the PM's biometrics, Stickell discovers the file contains access to 2.4 billion British pounds in various bank accounts, which would allow the Syndicate to continue their operations unnoticed; Hunt promptly destroys the data. At the meeting, outside the [[Tower of London]], he tells Lane he memorized the data, and offers himself in exchange for Dunn and Faust. Dunn escapes after the bomb on him is disarmed, while Ethan and Faust are chased through the streets of London by Lane's men. Faust kills Vinter in a knife fight, while Ethan confronts Lane and lures him into a sealed, bulletproof glass cell where he is gassed unconscious and taken into custody.  Hunley, having witnessed an IMF operation's success firsthand, returns with Brandt to the Senate committee and convinces them to restore the IMF by covering for Hunt and his team. After the meeting, Brandt congratulates Hunley, who is now the new IMF Secretary.  
Mojave (film)
 Tom, a successful Hollywood film director, is recovering from an all-night partying affair. He is still suffering from his heavy drinking and his "girlfriend" is still sleeping it off in bed as the sun rises. Tom decides to get away from it all by going to the desert in his jeep only to encounter an unexpected antagonist, who is a homicidal drifter named John "Jack" Jackson. Tom anticipates Jack's motives when Jack visits his camp at night and sends him away from his camp disarmed of his rifle and ammunition. Jack is armed with a Bowie knife he had concealed and slung on the inside of his coat. Tom manages to defend himself with a smaller retractable knife which he carries and which he is able to get out in time to overpower Jack and throw him out of the camp.  The next day, Tom is still in the desert and cannot return to L.A. because he had previously overturned in his jeep and cannot recover the disabled vehicle. He spends the night in a cave and when a figure appears in the entrance he assumes that it is Jack returning to rob him and he shoots at the figure, killing him instantly. On closer inspection it proves not to be Jack, but a patrolling police officer whom Tom has inadvertently killed. Since the rifle is the one which he took from Jack while disarming him, Tom leaves the scene with the rifle intentionally left behind in order to make it look as if Jack was the culprit. Meanwhile, Jack separately discovers the abandoned jeep in the desert the next day and manages to find a filled-out car registration form in it with Tom's name and address inside. Jack feels that with his information of Tom's misdeeds he can now return to L.A. and use the information to blackmail Tom for a few hundred thousand dollars. He starts to hitchhike back to L.A.  Tom returns to L.A. on his own not knowing anything about Jack's plans to confront him with his discovery of Tom's identity and his misdeeds in the desert. When Jack finally confronts Tom, it is Tom who tells Jack that his plan is very poorly developed and that he has in fact left evidence behind in the desert, such as Jack's rifle at the scene of the shooting, which will almost certainly convict Jack of the crime. Jack sees that he has been outwitted. Meanwhile, the police discover the dead officer left behind in the desert and begin to gather evidence. Jack and Tom must now discover which one of their stories will prevail.

Curtis wins a hand against Gerry and buys Gerry a premium glass of [[Woodford Reserve|Woodford Bourbon]], and a friendship begins.  Hours later, Gerry sees Curtis playing darts at a bar and returns the favor buying Curtis a drink.  Curtis explains that he is successful playing cards because he doesn't care about winning and just likes to play with no emotional investment in the outcome of the game.  The two drink heavily with Gerry passing out and waking up on a couch at Curtis' place.  After an unsuccessful real estate showing the next morning, Gerry goes to a dog track with Curtis. They initially win a large amount of money, but Gerry is unwilling to walk away, and he ultimately gambles away their winnings.  Afterwards, they drink at a bar where they attempt to bet $1,000 on a game of pool.  The men at the pool table are not interested and they intimidate Curtis and Gerry into leaving the bar.  In the parking lot, Curtis explains to Gerry that "Machu Picchu Time" is approaching, which is the phrase he uses whenever he leaves town, implying that he is heading to [[Machu Picchu]] in [[Peru]], which he has yet to actually visit.  Gerry is then threatened by a man who had overheard the attempted $1,000 bet in the bar, not knowing that Gerry was bluffing.  The man stabs Gerry, inflicting a mild wound on his abdomen.  The next morning, Gerry meets Sam ([[Alfre Woodard]]) in a restaurant, where she presses Gerry to repay her the money he owes but does not have.  She tells Gerry to pay up by the following day or else she will call upon her friend Tim to "pay [Gerry] a visit."  Gerry then runs into Curtis at a bar, where he proposes a trip down the [[Mississippi River]], where they will gamble at several major cities, and ultimately play at a poker game in [[New Orleans]] with a $25,000 buy-in.  Curtis agrees to stake Gerry with $2,000, provided that Gerry takes them with his car.  The two arrive in [[St. Louis]], where they meet prostitutes Simone ([[Sienna Miller]]) and Vanessa ([[Analeigh Tipton]]).  After Gerry has a very successful poker session on a [[riverboat casino]], Gerry and Curtis spend time in St. Louis with Simone and Vanessa.  Simone warns Curtis of previous times he has trusted a fellow gambler and ended up being deceived. In [[Memphis]], Gerry is playing very well at the poker table until he loses his entire stack when his [[List of poker hands#Full house|full house]] is bested by his opponent's better full house on the final "river" card of a Texas hold 'em game.  Gerry then lies to Curtis, saying that he won $20,000 and is inspired to go to [[Little Rock]] to make amends with his ex-wife.  Curtis agrees to come along for the ride.  Gerry is initially welcomed into his ex-wife's house, but is soon told to leave, with a push on the way out, when she catches him red-handed trying to lift a wad of cash from her sock drawer after lying to her about needing to use the bathroom.  Curtis and Gerry then go to [[Tunica, Mississippi]], where Curtis' Player's Club Card is rejected when he attempts to use it for a complimentary night's stay.  After asking Gerry for some money for the hotel room, Curtis discovers that Gerry has lied to him, and that Gerry in fact lost all of his money in Memphis.  Curtis tells Gerry that if he continues on this path, it will not end well for him.  In the restroom, Curtis agitates some fraternity boys, and when they see that Curtis has left the bathroom, they redirect their anger towards Gerry and beat him up instead.  The two go to a [[horse race]] in New Orleans.  After selling Gerry's car, they agree to bet on the horse "Toto's Revenge", but Curtis secretly bets on a different horse, "Mississippi Grind".  When Curtis' horse wins, he does not tell Gerry, and Gerry assumes they are out of money.  Having heard of Tony Roundtree ([[James Toback]]) from Curtis, Gerry goes to Tony's house for a poker game, but admits he does not have enough money to play and asks Tony to help him out with the buy-in.  Tony slaps him and shuts the door in his face.  Curtis loses a $100 prop bet in a 1-on-1 pick-up basketball game and is knocked to the ground by the man after reneging on the money as promised.  The player takes $200 from Curtis' stash but leaves the rest as Curtis lays dazed on the ground. Curtis then goes to a [[cabaret]] club where he buys a drink and leaves the rest of his winnings with a singer who turns out to be his mother ([[Marshall Chapman]]).  Gerry goes to a casino, where he tries his luck on a "Rainbow Riches" slot machine and fails. He then moves on to the [[roulette]] table where he places the last of his money on "00" and ends up winning.  He then begins playing [[blackjack]], where Curtis shows up at the table, out of money.  Gerry is playing well, and shares his money with Curtis.  After several hours of playing [[craps]], the two have amassed a huge fortune, totaling $285,000.  Curtis calls Simone and proclaims his love for her.  Convinced that they cannot lose, Curtis and Gerry wager all their money on the field line. Gerry throws the dice, and the outcome is unclear.  Curtis and Gerry are shown eating steak and lobster, discussing their winnings of nearly half a million dollars.  They are comped a suite where they keep their cash in a large safe.  The next morning, Curtis awakes to Simone calling him. He turns his phone off, and it's revealed that he has already hooked up with another stranger. Curtis looks through the apartment, only to find that Gerry has already left.  In the safe, he finds his half of the money along with a note from Gerry, saying "Machu Picchu time, you beautiful loser."  Curtis checks out of the hotel, but before doing so he flirts with the checkout clerk, implying that he will never settle down with Simone, nor pursue Machu Picchu as anything but a dream. Meanwhile, Gerry re-purchases the car he sold in order to stake his final run at the casino. When he starts the car, he hears the CD previously left in the stereo that played during his earlier road trip with Curtis. The CD, which describes ways to identify the strength or weakness of your opponents' hands, begins with describing what true confidence in a person looks like. Gerry listens, his posture rising, as a reflection of the American flag can be seen on the windshield.

On her mother's advice, she contacts her soon-to-be stepsister Brooke ([[Greta Gerwig]]), who also lives in New York.  Tracy is immediately entranced by Brooke and her lifestyle. After spending a whirlwind night with her, she pens a short story and submits it to her college's prestigious literary magazine. Tracy continues to spend time with Brooke, who reveals her plans for a small and eclectic restaurant called "Mom's" after her dead mother; the restaurant is being financed by her partner. Upon returning home one night, however, Brooke finds herself locked out of her apartment and discovers that her boyfriend has withdrawn financial support. With massive bills for the restaurant coming due, Brooke visits a psychic with Tracy. Tracy interprets the psychic's words as meaning that Brooke should ask for the money from her former friend Mamie-Claire, with whom she had a falling out after Mamie-Claire stole her idea for a business and married her former fiancé.  Tracy has Tony drive her and Brooke to Mamie-Claire's home in Connecticut, with Nicolette joining them to make sure that Tony and Tracy are not having an affair. At Mamie-Claire's home, Brooke and the others crash Mamie-Claire's book party, and Brooke pitches her restaurant to Mamie-Claire, hoping she will invest. Mamie-Claire, who confides to Tracy that she did steal Brooke's T-shirt idea to become rich, insists that she will have to talk to her husband, Dylan. While waiting for Dylan's arrival, Brooke takes a call from her dad, who informs her that his wedding with Tracy's mom has been called off. When Dylan comes home, rather than dismiss Brooke, he asks her to pitch her restaurant. Brooke stumbles, but Tracy, still enthused by the project, helps her to pitch it. Dylan tells Brooke he will give her the money but insists that, rather than invest in it, he will give it to her to cover the debt she will have from dissolving the business. Seeing that Tracy is upset by this, and also the toxic effect the offer is immediately having on Dylan and Mamie-Claire's relationship, Brooke ultimately refuses the money. Meanwhile, Nicolette, who witnessed Tracy kissing Tony, confronts Tracy about her short story. The entire party reads it, and Brooke becomes offended by the brutal way in which Tracy characterized her. She informs her that they are no longer about to become sisters, as their parents no longer want to marry, and tells Tracy that she will sue. Upset, Tracy, sitting outside the house, takes a hit on the bong that Tony had earlier fashioned from an apple with her initial emblazoned on it, smoking [[Marijuana|weed]] that he had presumably stolen from Dylan's freezer.  Tracy's story is accepted by the university's prestigious literary society, and for a while she joins the group. Still finding herself unable to fit in, she decides to start her own literary club, inviting both Tony and Nicolette to apply for membership.  Finding herself alone on Thanksgiving, Tracy goes to Brooke's old apartment and finds her packing her things, about to move to [[Los Angeles]]. She learns that Brooke was able to cover her debts, as Mamie-Claire gave her what would have been her share of money from the T-shirt business. Brooke also tells her that she has passed the [[Scholastic Achievement Test|SAT]] and that she has been accepted into college and is considering going. Tracy invites Brooke to have Thanksgiving dinner with her. The two eat out at a restaurant, as the film concludes with Tracy, as narrator, musing: "Being a beacon of hope for lesser people is a lonely business."

Nevertheless, the two have an amicable divorce and continue to sleep together from time to time. While attending therapy Georgio apologizes to Tony for hurting her. The two take Sinbad on vacation together. Tony gets a high publicity case defending a murderer and she realizes that Georgio is not happy for her despite explaining to him that the case will make her career. Busy with her case, Tony is surprised by Georgio at her office one day who tells her he is afraid of losing her and that soon it will be their ten-year anniversary. He threatens her with physical violence. She tells him that he already lost her a long time ago, and that physical violence could not be worse than the emotional violence he has put her through.  Leaving rehab, Tony returns to normal life where she goes to a parent-teacher interview. Georgio makes an appearance, and though it is clear they still care about each other and share a mutual attraction, they do not interact, and they do not engage in a fight or any of the passive-aggressive behaviour that marked so much of their relationship. Georgio leaves early, saying goodbye to the teachers but not directly to Tony, who smiles wistfully before turning back to the interview.

Moor (film)
 Recently widowed, Wahidullah Khan ([[Hameed Sheikh]]) is a troubled station-master at the [[Khost railway station]] on the fractured [[Bostan, Pishin|Bostan]]-[[Zhob District|Zhob]] tracks. The station, his sole source of income, has been reduced to a pitiable ruin due to the prevalence of a mafia which has caused several rifts in the [[Baluchistan, Pakistan|Baluchistan]] railways. Using a combination of incentives and coercion, it acquires the land on which the tracks and stations were situated – and builds commercial and residential developments there. Additionally, it sells the steel, removed from the tracks, for a fortune. Wahid is in a predicament; torn between a verbal agreement to sell the station and tracks under his care to the mafia – including his brother, Zahir (Shabbir Rana), and gang leader, Lalu (Sultan Hussain) – and the last wishes of his deceased wife, Palwasha ([[Samiya Mumtaz]]). She vehemently opposed the deal, based on a strong conviction that this land keeps her family rooted.  Meanwhile, Wahid’s son, Ehsaanullah Khan (Shaz Khan), has set out to turn his fortunes in Karachi, Pakistan’s troubled megacity, only with the memory of his mother’s guidance to use time to his advantage. Yet the city, which appeared to be a sweet promise of success from a distance, is more unforgiving than Balochistan’s treacherous landscape; here, time is at no one’s mercy.  Frustrated by his circumstances, Ehsaan chooses the more dishonourable trajectory to success, by getting involved in the corrupt, but highly lucrative, business of counterfeit documentation. He continues in the business even after his mother’s passing, and a scandal that almost exposes him in the film’s opening sequences. He is, nonetheless, persistently haunted by his conscience and his mother’s upright values of honour and loyalty to the land.[http://newslinemagazine.com/magazine/movie-review-moor/]

Moonwalkers (film)
 In the days leading up to the [[Apollo 11|moon landing]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Tom Kidman is tasked with hiring [[Stanley Kubrick]] to film a fake moonwalk, in the event the astronauts fail in their mission. The CIA views the moon landing as a potential ideological victory over the [[Soviet Union]], necessary for American morale. The CIA provides Kidman with a large sum of cash money in a briefcase to act as an incentive for Kubrick, with the orders to murder Kubrick upon completion of the mission to prevent the story from leaking out. Unbeknownst to the CIA, Kidman is suffering from [[post traumatic stress disorder]] due to time spent in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and feels compelled to respond to any frustration with extreme violence.  Kidman travels to England to speak with Kubrick's agent, only to accidentally hold a meeting with the agent's cousin, Jonny Thorpe, a struggling band promoter in debt to a [[East end of London|East End]] gangster named the Iron Monger. Jonny agrees to arrange a sit-down between Kidman and Kubrick, then convinces his stoner roommate Leon to pose as the director. Leon and Kidman meet, and Jonny accepts the briefcase of money, promising that the movie will be made. Thinking that Kidman is simply a Hollywood producer, the pair go on a spending spree before the Iron Monger's henchman break into Jonny's house, beat him, and steal the briefcase.  Kidman sees a news story about Stanley Kubrick on television and realizes he didn't meet with the real man. He confronts Jonny, who confesses his scheme. Seeing an opportunity to establish himself as a success, Jonny promises that a friend of his, a director named Renatus, can film a fake moon landing. Jonny takes Kidman to meet Renatus at the director's mansion, which he has turned into a [[commune]]. Thinking that he's being hired for an art project, Renatus accepts. Meanwhile, a [[hippie]] girl named Ella takes an interest in Kidman.  Kidman takes Jonny to confront the Iron Monger and get the briefcase of money back. Rather than negotiate with the Iron Monger, Kidman murders several of his henchmen and takes the briefcase back by force. Production is stalled when Renatus insists on approaching the film as a piece of [[performance art]], intending to include several artistic flourishes. In an attempt to show off his alleged immunity to marijuana, Kidman takes a hit from a [[bong]], which turns out to have been laced with opium. In an effort to help him recover from the effects, Ella gives him [[LSD]], sending Kidman on a [[bad trip]], after which he has sex with Ella. In the throes of his trip, Kidman tells Ella and Leon that he no longer feels compelled to solve his problems with violence. Afterwards, he makes an incoherent call to the CIA, attempting to update them on his status.  Alarmed by Kidman's call, the CIA sends several agents to England. They take the entire commune hostage and force everyone to begin filming the fake moon landing. Jonny and Leon take on the roles of the astronauts; Leon, nervous at the prospect of being on television, gets high and begins having a trip on set, stumbling around the fake moon surface. Meanwhile, the Iron Monger arrives and engages in a shootout with the CIA, which results in most of the Iron Monger's henchmen and the CIA agents being killed. In the midst of the shootout, the fake footage is successfully broadcast via closed circuit to CIA headquarters. Jonny, feeling like he finally has the opportunity to make a difference in the world, attempts to protect Kidman from the Iron Monger but is shot. After killing the Iron Monger, Kidman tells a stunned Jonny that his space suit absorbed the bullet, and lies that Jonny's interference saved his life.  Now wanted by the CIA, Jonny, Leon, Kidman, and Ella flee England. A montage shows news clips of American life throughout the 1960s, culminating with [[Apollo 11]] reaching the moon. In [[Spain]], Jonny, Leon, Ella, and Kidman enter a bar in time to watch the moon landing with several villagers. The quartet are unable to tell if the landing is real or if they're watching their own fake footage.

Most Likely to Die
  The story begins with a woman named Ashley driving her car up the hills to the house of her boyfriend Ray, a former professional hockey player who was recently cut from his team. Ashley arrives at the house but Ray is nowhere to be found, and she discovers several threatening messages throughout the house. She flees down a path through the desert but is caught in a trap and dragged into a shed.  Later, Gaby arrives to the house and is greeted by Ray's housekeeper Tarkin, who freaks her out with his strange behavior. Gaby finds the faces of her and her friends put up on a wall, but is disturbed to see that Ashley's face has been crossed out in red paint. The others - Freddie, Jade, DJ, Lamont, and Simone - arrive to help Gaby plan their 10-year high school reunion. Gaby is angry to learn her ex-boyfriend Brad, now a famous actor, is coming to the reunion, after he had abandoned Gaby when she became pregnant in high school. The group play poker and discuss a boy named John Dougherty, whom they all played a cruel prank on in school by crossing his picture out of the yearbook and writing "Most likely to die" underneath it. John was later caught with a gun in his locker and expelled before being sent to juvenile hall. Brad arrives with his girlfriend Bella, and tensions rise between him and Gaby. Tarkin spies on Bella changing into her swimsuit, and he is suddenly strangled to death by a figure wearing a graduation cap, gown, and a paper mache mask.  The group eventually notices that Ray and Ashley are missing and split up to search for them. Gaby discovers Ashley's dead body in the shack with her throat slit and wrapped in Christmas lights. The lights also spell Ashley. (Ashley was Most Likely to Have Her Name Up In Lights). Everyone comes down to the shack to investigate except for Simone, who stays alone in the house. Lamont decides to take his car to go and find help, but while driving down the mountain his car dies and he is forced to continue on foot. Simone, alone in the house, is attacked and murdered by the graduate. The others return to the house and find their cars have all been damaged, leaving them stranded. They find Simone's body floating in the hot tub and realize the graduate is killing all of them according to the things they were voted most likely to do in their high school yearbooks. (Simone was Most Likely To Get What She Wants and stated earlier she wanted to spend the rest of her life in the hot tub.) Bella becomes convinced the entire thing is a hoax by Brad, and she and DJ leave the house to check to see if Ashley and Simone are actually dead.  The graduate attacks Brad and stabs him, but he is saved by Gaby. Bella runs back into the house in a panic, but is decapitated by the graduate before she can reveal what happened to DJ. Jade rescues Gaby by shooting at the graduate, but when Gaby takes the gun and tries to follow him, the graduate kidnaps and ties Jade up before tricking Gaby into shooting her in the chest, leaving as Jade dies in Gaby's arms. (Jade was Most Likely to Break Hearts.)  Lamont eventually becomes lost walking through the desert and stumbles upon an unconscious DJ, who claims Ray attacked him. Lamont helps DJ up, but DJ suddenly kills him by shoving a wooden spike down his throat. (Lamont was Most Likely To Eat Anything). DJ returns to the house and reveals himself as the killer, revealing he has been keeping Ray tied up. DJ exposits that Ray had forced DJ to plant the gun in John Dougherty's locker to keep Ray from getting in too much trouble for the yearbook prank. DJ rekindled his friendship with John several years later, but when DJ revealed what he had done in an attempt to make amends, John supposedly committed suicide. DJ now wants to kill all of his other friends as vengeance for destroying John's entire life, and plans to frame Ray for the murders. He offers to let Gaby and Freddie live if they help him murder the rest of their class at the reunion, and if Gaby kills Brad. Gaby pretends to agree and non-fatally stabs Brad, before taking the gun from DJ and shooting him to death. (DJ was Most Likely To Have The Last Laugh. After his death Gaby states: "Who's got the last laugh now, motherfucker.")  Gaby, Brad, Freddie, and Ray escape the house and leave. As the film ends, an unknown figure wearing a graduation robe enters the house and picks the mask up off of DJ's dead body and puts it on their own face - it is heavily implied to be the spirit of (or the actual) John Dougherty.

Mr. Holmes
 In 1947, the long-retired [[Sherlock Holmes]], aged 93, lives in a remote [[Sussex]] farmhouse with his widowed housekeeper Mrs Munro and her young son Roger. Having just returned from a trip to [[Hiroshima]], Holmes starts to use jelly made from the [[Zanthoxylum piperitum|prickly ash]] plant he acquired there to try to improve his [[memory disorder|failing memory]]. Unhappy about [[Dr. Watson|Watson's]] fictionalisation of his last case, ''The Adventure of the Dove Grey Glove'', he hopes to write his own account, but has trouble recalling the events. As Holmes spends time with Roger, showing him how to take care of the bees in the farmhouse's [[apiary]], he comes to appreciate Roger's curiosity and intelligence and develops a paternal liking for him.  Over time, Roger's prodding helps Holmes remember the case (shown in flashbacks); he knows he must have failed somehow, as it resulted in his retirement from the detective business. Almost 30 years earlier, after the [[First World War]] had ended and Watson had married and left [[Baker Street]], Thomas Kelmot approached Holmes to find out why his wife Ann had become estranged from him after suffering two [[miscarriage]]s. Holmes followed Ann around London and observed her seemingly preparing to murder her husband - forging cheques in her husband's name and cashing them, confirming the details of his will, buying poison, paying a man, and checking train schedules. Holmes, however, deduced her true intentions: to have gravestones made for herself and her miscarried children (the man she paid was a [[stonemason]]) and then commit suicide with the poison. Confronting her, Holmes confessed he had the same feelings of loneliness and isolation, but his intellectual pursuits sufficed for him. Ann asked Holmes if they could share the burden of their loneliness together. Holmes was tempted, but instead advised her to return to her husband. She poured the poison on the ground, thanked Holmes, and departed. Holmes later learned that Ann killed herself by stepping in front of an oncoming train. Blaming himself, he retired and fell into a deep [[depression (mood)|depression]]. Watson briefly returns to care for him and, discovering the details of the case, rewrites the tragedy into a success.  A second series of flashbacks recounts Holmes' recent trip to Japan, where he met a supposed admirer named Tamiki Umezaki who had told him of the benefits of prickly ash. In fact, Umezaki had a hidden motive for meeting Holmes. Years before, Umezaki's [[anglophile]] father had traveled to England. In a letter, the father wrote that he had been advised by the brilliant Holmes to remain there permanently, abandoning his wife and son. Holmes bluntly told Umezaki that his father simply wanted a new life for himself and that Holmes had never met him. Umezaki was crushed.  In the present, Mrs Munro gradually becomes dissatisfied with her work, and Holmes's overall health deteriorates and he spends more time with her son. After he becomes unconscious from an experiment with the prickly ash, he requires more physical care. Mrs. Munro accepts a job at a hotel in [[Portsmouth]], planning to take Roger to work there as well. Roger does not want to go, being unhappy with his barely literate mother and his family's working-class status, and tension develops between mother and son. Holmes and Mrs Munro later discover Roger lying unconscious near the house, a victim of multiple stings, and he is rushed to a hospital. Distraught, Mrs Munro tries to burn down the apiary, blaming Holmes for caring only about himself and his bees. Holmes stops her, having realised that Roger had been stung by wasps; Roger found their nest and tried to drown them to protect the bees, but they swarmed on him instead. Holmes and Mrs Munro burn down the wasp nest together, and Roger regains consciousness. Holmes tells Mrs Munro how he was too fearful to open himself to act as a caring person with Ann Kelmot, and that he wants Mrs Munro and Roger to stay in his life, leaving them his house and grounds after his death.  Holmes writes his first work of fiction: a letter to Umezaki, telling him that his father was a brave, honourable man who worked secretly and effectively for the [[British Empire]]. As Roger begins to teach his mother how to care for the bees, Holmes emulates a tradition he saw being practiced in Hiroshima: creating a ring of stones to serve as a place where he can recall the loved ones he has lost over the years.

Francis decides to come to the apartment. Although Hopper is waiting for him, Francis is able to stun him unconscious. Francis drags Hopper into the apartment, where he tells Martha and Sophie that Hopper is not an FBI agent. Martha does not know what to believe, but then remembers that Francis has always told her the truth. She decides to go with him. As they leave, assassins working for the mob family arrive. One assassin, Steve, surprises Francis with his impressive combat skills, and the pair express mutual admiration. As Francis takes care of the other assassins, he is again surprised when Steve disarms him. The mobsters take Martha and provide an address where Francis can find them.

Mr. Airavata
 The film opens with the chief minister and IG of Karnataka coming to the house of Vitta Gowda ([[Anant Nag|Ananth Nag]]) to request him to send his grandson Airavata ([[Darshan (actor)|Darshan]]) to duty as soon as possible. He agrees but with certain reasonable conditions. Outside, a reporter asks her senior the reason for such a fuss. The senior explains the story. 6 months earlier, Airavata had joined Bangalore police as the ACP. He brought over a big change to the crime filled city and slowly eradicated all signs of criminal activity. He brings up new rules that serve the public without consulting higher officials and does these through his own money. These rules cause huge losses to several criminals, mostly to Prathap Kale ([[Prakash Raj]]) who immediately calls upon an enmity with Airavata. During this while a reporter Priya ([[Urvashi Rautela]]) falls in love with Airavata, and is later shown to be the girl Airavata had saved previously from an accident, hence the reason for love. Despite this, Airavata does not reciprocate her feelings. During the preparations for a government event, Airavata is arrested by the force and is revealed to be a bogus officer. He reveals his story during an open court session. Airavata was a farmer who had gone to Bangalore to solve the problems of a few farmers. His sister Charu ([[Sindhu Lokanath]]) gets raped by their workers when she goes to plough the fields. A corrupt cop refused to take the family's complaint which results in Charu's suicide. Their friend Prakasa ([[Bullet Prakash]]) kills the inspector and is shot dead in the process. Airavata vows revenge and when Karnataka police gives a job opening in Bangalore, Airavata gets himself posted there by wrong means. The court declares Airavata innocent and sends him back to his village. On the request of the people, Airavata writes the civil service exam and is reposted as ACP. Now the story comes back to the present. The reporter is curious of what will be Airavata's next move. Airavata slowly begins to take down Prathap Kale's empire once more. He also accepts Priya's love. Towards the end, Prathap Kale kidnaps each and every police officer's daughters along with Priya intending to sell them abroad. Airavata arrives in the nook of time and saves them and kills Prathap Kale. At a felicitation ceremony, he submits his resignation form, saying that should crime rise again, then he will join the force once more. The film ends with Airavata and a child (Vineesh Darshan) saluting towards the screen.

At the same time, his poor command of the English language made it worse, resulting in certain phrases, such as "stunned like vegetable", sounding relatively wonky. However, his disciple, Lawrence ([[Tosh Zhang]]), is extremely supportive of this decision, as he is encouraged by his mother to listen to Eric's songs. To show his strong will and persistence in order to fulfil his dreams, Eric is determined to go on an unbelievable musical journey, even at the ripe age of 50.

The three take Raghu to a run down factory and almost kill him there.  However, as luck would have it, Raghu doesn't die but is charred completely. He reaches out to Popo ([[Tanmay Bhat]]), his friend from office whose sister works at a lab. When there, his sisters explain to them that there is a severe case of radiation and there is no cure for it. There is an untested potion which he swallows but this causes a complete cell regeneration from the scratch which causes him to become invisible in all lights except black light and direct sun light.  Meanwhile, Siya begins believing that Raghu killed the CM and starts hating him. She plunges into more and more work to avoid feeling the pain of heartbreak. When Raghu regains his composure, he wants to kill those who landed him into a situation like that. The first on his target is Tiwari. After a drunken night when Tiwari is driving home, Raghu finds him and says that he will kill him in 24 hours. A very panicky Tiwari narrates this to his colleagues who don't take him seriously. Siya tries to protect him but fails when the invisible Raghu kills him. But Siya discovers Raghu. She tries to tap him via Popo but cannot as Raghu escapes from Siya's arrest.  Meanwhile, Raghu's next target is Aditya whose security is entrusted on Siya. Raghu after a long battle with Siya manages to kill him as well. But Siya is not willing to back down. When senior authorities give the responsibility of shooting down Mr. X in an encounter she backs out from it. Raghu gets drawn towards her love and the two spend a few special days with each other. The duo go for lunch to a quiet place and Raghu notices that the place is empty. Before he knows it, the place is attacked by the police and Raghu is arrested.  Raghu is taken to a dilapidated place by Bhardwaj who wants to make sure Raghu is dead this time. Meanwhile, Popo who attempts a suicide after being attacked by Bhardwaj who wanted to get more information on Raghu, tells Siya that Bhardwaj had hatched a plan to kill Raghu. Siya goes to the place where Raghu and Bhardwaj engage in a duel. Siya urges Raghu to let Bhardwaj free. She later tricks Bhardwaj into a nerving confession recorded on camera by her father Devraj ([[Bikramjeet Kanwarpal]]) and exposes him at a press conference. When Bhardwaj tries to kill Siya, Raghu kills him.  The movie concludes with Siya (presumably, having accepted Raghu with his condition) kissing her under a shower.

Mustang (film)
 The film starts with Lale, the youngest of the five sisters and the protagonist, bidding an emotional farewell at school to her female teacher, who is moving to [[Istanbul]]. The sisters decide to walk home instead of taking a van, to enjoy the sunny day. Along the way, they play in the water at the beach with their classmates. For one game, they sit on boys' shoulders and try to knock each other off. When they reach home, their grandmother scolds and hits them for their having this kind of bodily contact with boys and thus "pleasuring themselves" with them. Their uncle Erol is equally furious. From then on, the girls are forbidden from leaving the house, even for school.  The sisters feel stifled in their home as their grandmother tries to make them suitable for marriage. When in public they must now dress in drab, conservative clothing. Instead of attending school, they must stay home, where they are taught how to cook, clean and sew by their female relatives. Even so, the oldest sister, Sonay, sneaks out occasionally to meet her lover, and Lale looks for various ways to escape.  Lale, who loves football, is forbidden from attending [[Trabzonspor]] matches. She resolves to go to a match from which [[Behind closed doors (sport)#No men|men have been banned]] due to [[Football hooliganism|hooliganism]]. A friend tells her that the girls in the village are going together on a bus. The sisters, who are happy for an opportunity to leave the house, sneak out of the house with Lale. When they miss the bus, they hitch a ride with a passing truck driver, Yasin, who helps them catch up to it. They’re ecstatic in the exuberant atmosphere of the all-female crowd cheering for their team. Back home, their aunt catches a glimpse of them at the match on TV, just as their uncle and other village men are about to tune in. To prevent the men from finding out, she cuts the house's, and then the whole village's, electricity.  When the girls return, their grandmother decides to start marrying the sisters off. They’re taken to town, ostensibly "to get lemonade", which is actually an opportunity to show them off to potential suitors. Soon enough, a suitor and his family arrive to meet them. Sonay vows to only marry her lover and refuses to meet the prospective suitor and his family. Selma is sent instead and becomes engaged. Sonay gets engaged a short while later to her lover. At the two sisters' joint wedding, Sonay is clearly happy while Selma is not. On the night of her wedding, Selma's in-laws come to view the bed sheets in a traditional ritual to establish that Selma was a virgin before her wedding night. Because there is no blood on the sheet, her in-laws take her to a physician to have her virginity tested.  Next in line for marriage is Ece. It’s revealed that her uncle is sexually abusing her at night. In Lale’s words, she starts acting “dangerously.” When the three remaining girls stop with their uncle near a bank, Ece allows a boy to have sexual contact with her in their car. She makes jokes at the lunch table, inciting loud laughs from her sisters, and is told to go to her room, where she shoots herself and dies. The surviving sisters and their family attend the funeral.  Now it is just the two youngest sisters, Nur and Lale, at home. Lale continues sneaking out. On one impulsive attempt to walk to Istanbul alone she is encountered by Yasin, the truck driver, who is kind to her. At Lale's request, he later teaches her how to drive. When she is caught on the way back into her house, the house is again reinforced to try to make it impossible for them to leave.  It becomes evident that the uncle starts abusing Nur and that their grandmother knows about it. She says that now it is time for her to be married off. Though she is young, she is found a suitor and engaged to be married. On the night of Nur's wedding, Lale convinces her to resist, and the girls bar themselves inside the house while the whole wedding party is outside, much to the embarrassment of their family. As the wedding party disperses, their uncle violently tries to get inside. Lale finds the phone hidden in a cupboard and plugs it in to call Yasin for help. The girls gather up money and a few supplies, grab the uncle's car keys, and sneak out of the house. They manage to escape in the car, crashing it close to their house. They hide and wait for Yasin, who picks them up and takes them to the local bus station. The girls take the bus to Istanbul, where they find their former teacher, who greets them warmly.

 The students of Canterlot High School prepare for the Friendship Games, an academic and sporting competition regularly held between their school's team, the Wondercolts, and the undefeated [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#The Shadowbolts|Shadowbolts]] from Crystal Prep Academy. [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Sunset Shimmer|Sunset Shimmer]], who has been observing her friends' magical ability to "pony up" – grow pony-like ears, tails, and wings – whenever they play musical instruments, becomes concerned when [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Rainbow Dash|Rainbow Dash]] transforms during a [[pep rally]], seemingly at random. Tasked with finding the cause of this development, Sunset attempts to contact [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Twilight Sparkle|Twilight Sparkle]] in Equestria for advice, but receives no response.  Meanwhile, Crystal Prep is attended by the [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Twilight Sparkle|counterpart of Twilight]], who investigates the magical activity surrounding Canterlot High. Twilight builds a locket-like device with which to detect and contain the magic for further study, hoping this will secure her application for Everton, a coveted [[independent study]] program. However, her school's [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Principal Abacus Cinch|Principal Cinch]] threatens to revoke the application in order to blackmail Twilight into participating in the Friendship Games and maintain Crystal Prep's victory record.  Upon Twilight's arrival at Canterlot High, her device detects Sunset and her friends' magic and leads Twilight to them; as she approaches, the device inadvertently drains [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Rarity|Rarity]]'s magic when she "ponies up" after making uniforms for her friends. Sunset, initially mistaking Twilight for her pony counterpart, quickly realizes the misunderstanding and considers consulting the pony Twilight in person. When Crystal Prep's Twilight follows her to the portal to Equestria, the device absorbs the portal's magic and seals it off. The device similarly affects [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Pinkie Pie|Pinkie Pie]] and [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Fluttershy|Fluttershy]] when they attempt to befriend Twilight during the games, briefly tearing open dimensional rifts to Equestria as a result each time, and giving Twilight's dog, [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Spike|Spike]], the ability to speak.  Following Twilight's victory in the games' academic decathlon, the games continue with a "tricross relay", a [[relay race]] between [[archery]], [[speed skating]] and [[motocross]]. [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Applejack|Applejack]] transforms after advising a struggling Twilight in her stage of the race, causing the device to steal Applejack's magic and create a rift that temporarily brings monstrous plants through. Rainbow Dash "ponies up" to save the other competitors before losing her own magic, allowing Canterlot High to win the event to tie with Crystal Prep, but causing Cinch to accuse Canterlot High of cheating due to their perceived advantage through magic.  Before the final event, Cinch and the Shadowbolts pressure Twilight into releasing the accumulated magic within her device to harness it against the Wondercolts. The magic instead corrupts Twilight, turning her into a winged and horned monster, and she proceeds to obsessively open more rifts that threaten to destroy the parallel world. As the Wondercolts and Shadowbolts work together to save their classmates, Sunset notices her friends' magical auras and realizes that their magic manifests when they exhibit the same traits as the Elements of Harmony. Gathering their magic with the device, Sunset assumes an angelic form,</ref>}} closes the rifts and returns Twilight to normal.  Refusing to relent for manipulating Twilight, Cinch threatens to report the incident to the school board. When taunted that no one would believe her account of the magical incidents, however, she concedes to a tie that is celebrated by both teams. Reconsidering her Everton application, Twilight realizes she is happier at Canterlot High and transfers there, where Sunset and the other students welcome her as a new friend.  In a [[Post-credits scene|pre-credits scene]], the Twilight from Equestria emerges from the unsealed portal with the counterparts of her friends gathered around it. She apologizes for her absence, explaining that she has just escaped from a [[Time loop|time travel loop]], before gawking at the sight of her own counterpart.

Rinko invites Takeo and Suna on a group date to an [[amusement park]] where her friends meet Takeo for the first time. They immediately criticise him behind his back but Rinko defends Takeo who she thinks is cool. In the Haunted House Suna almost tells Takeo that Rinko likes him when Takeo realises the ride is on fire. Trapped by the fire Takeo breaks through the wall to let people escape. A falling coffin almost hurts Rinko but Takeo manages to stop it falling. Rinko tries to help Takeo and when he sees her smiling he manages to throw the coffin by himself and they escape. Suna admits he never had a girlfriend because every girl who confessed to him had insulted Takeo behind his back, whereas Rinko only says nice things. Rinko's friends admit Takeo is cool. Takeo's previous crush, Kagami, works at the theme park, and when she asks if Rinko is his girlfriend Takeo states that such a thing would be impossible, upsetting Rinko.  A depressed Takeo starts performing poorly in sports, while a similarly depressed Rinko bakes numerous cakes nonstop. She learns that Takeo had a crush on Kagami. Takeo meets with Rinko to buy a present for Suna's birthday. Awkward at first they end up enjoying the trip but when they talk about who they both like, Takeo assumes Rinko is talking about Suna, while Rinko thinks Takeo still likes Kagami. They end up promising to help each other with their future relationships. After Suna overhears Takeo talking with his father about love he hatches a plan.  On his birthday Suna tells Takeo Rinko is crying at a bakery when she is actually at home with her friends. Takeo rushes to find her and eventually realises Rinko is not at the bakery, but she had asked the owner to teach her how to make a cake she once gave to him. Following several messages from Suna, Takeo travels to other bakeries and sweet shops, each of which Rinko had visited to learn how to make all the cakes and sweets she gave to him, including the shop where Takeo's mother works to learn how to cook his favourite pork miso onigiri. She had written every recipe in a notebook, including notes on which food Takeo liked best, which Takeo's mother remembered she used to do when she first fell in love with Takeo's father. Takeo slowly realises Rinko had actually liked him the whole time, and with some encouragement from Suna, runs to Rinko's house. Rinko hears Takeo shouting and rushes to meet him and they finally confess they love each other. To thank Suna for his help they throw a birthday party for him with a cake baked by Rinko. Suna ends up laughing hysterically at how similar Takeo and Rinko's personalities are now they are dating.  In an after credits scene in Suna's bedroom Takeo admits that he managed to mess up on holding Rinko's hand for the first time and is worried he will also mess up their first kiss. To keep that from happening he insists on practising kissing with Suna.  
My Name Is Emily
 In Dublin, Ireland, 14-year-old Emily Egan (Lynch) has been placed into foster care  after her philosophical father Robert (Smiley), a local university professor and best-selling author of ''Swimming and Sex'' is committed to a psychiatric institution in the northern part of the country following complaints from locals of disturbing behaviour (such as frequent public nudity), his papers having been signed by a distant relative who felt he was no longer competent to raising Emily. Two years later, after having been hauled from one foster home to the next, including her uncle's where an older cousin of hers attempted to sexually abuse her from reading her father's novel on sex, Emily lives with June (Chiarain) and Steve (Loui Vangelder), foster parents she feels are not the worst but too suffocating, often rebuffing their attempts at kindness, notably June's. Emily feels June pressures her to be happy when she finds herself incapable of doing so due to her [[clinical depression]]. In the present, she often reflects on her happy earlier childhood (Millie Donnelly, Hunter and Sadie Fitzmaurice, Sarah Minto) with her father, her unconventional homeschooled education with him and how he changed dramatically after the death of her mother, also named Emily (Mullins) on the night of her birthday in a car accident, an event that led to his [[mental breakdown]]; he became obsessive with writing, refusing to eat and sleep and was preoccupied with the concept that humans and the surrounding universe, such as a blade of grass, shared the same molecules. As an ode to her mother, Emily dons an intricate bracelet she used to wear at all times.  Emily is enrolled in a new secondary school and quickly attracts the attention of an awkward half-Irish, half-English classmate Arden (Webster) who is unrequitedly smitten with her, though she is initially standoffish and uninterested in his attempts of a relationship. Contrarily, Emily is outcast by her teachers and bullied by her peers (Hughes) for her oddity and intellectual arrogance, such as refusing to introduce herself on her first day and rebelling against an assignment to dissect a [[Woodsworth]] poem "Ode on Intimations of Immortality" for its obvious sexual message. On the day of her 16th birthday where Emily is troubled at the absence of a [[birthday card]] from her father, a tradition he has kept since his commitment, she contemplates [[suicide]] at the bottom of the school pool, much to the concern and frustration of her swimming teacher (McCann) who is forced to pull her to safety. Not comprehending her actions, she is further humiliated by her classmates as she is banned from class. Later that afternoon, Arden drops by her home to deliver a present, an old book handed down to him by his Irish grandmother (McCusker), [[Steinbeck]]'s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''. Emily does not thank him, though accepts the gift.  Thereafter, she welcomes him accompanying her on their way home from school. When she returns home however, she grows upset at still finding that no letter from her father has arrived in the mail and despite June's assurance, she has an emotional meltdown. The next morning, she meets Arden at his home during a confrontation with his strict, physically abusive father (Conlon) and sensitive, submissive mother (White) and pleads for him to help her travel to the psychiatric institution and rescue Robert. At first reluctant, Arden eventually agrees as they both skip school. At first, they attempt to hitchhike in the rain with no luck until Arden enlists the help of his Granny to borrow her 70s canary-yellow [[Renault 4]]. After a full day on the road, on the following morning the two stop by a supermarket for breakfast, though Emily manipulates her way into only paying for a bouquet of flowers for Robert while shoplifting the rest, which upsets Arden given he would rather pay "like normal people" would, prompting Emily to justify that the money would be more useful towards border crossing and questions what it means to be "normal."  Following this incident, Emily grows paranoid of authority, believing they will attempt to stop her of reaching her destination and at one point, orders Arden to drive away from a curious policeman (Ó Héalai) questioning them for IDs. Camping on the beach for the night, Emily and Arden are ambushed by a local gang. When Arden is beaten in an outnumbered fight and runs towards the car for help, Emily is left vulnerable inside the tent where she is threatened to be [[rape]]d by the gang's leader, telling him coldly, "Fuck off." However, Arden returns having retrieved his deceased grandfather's handgun from the glove compartment, frightening the gang into submission as they flee. A mutual trust therein develops between Emily and Arden as they eventually arrive at the institution.  Arden invents a theatrical distraction atop the roof of one of the buildings, entertaining the patients whilst alarming the orderlies as Emily, bouquet in hand, searches for Robert. Coming upon his room however, she finds not her father but Dr. Golding (McGovern) who quietly informs her that her father is no longer at the facility. Inviting her to his office, he explains to her that the hospital does not hold people against their will, that Robert, after sometime, voluntarily admitted himself, a fact that greatly upsets Emily. Destroying the flowers outside, Arden comes to her aid where the two leave to Emily's grandfather's summerhouse, uncertain of their paths. After getting into a disagreement, Arden storms out of the home where Emily attempts to follow him, though meets her father instead unexpectedly. Emily confronts him with her feelings of abandonment, telling him, "You said nothing could separate us. But you did," not understanding why he would intentionally shut her out as she exits and runs towards the cliffs overlooking the ocean. Emily leaps into the water where Arden retrieves her and pulls her to shore, expressing his feelings for her. Emily opens herself up to him and as the two head back towards the summerhouse, they kiss. As Emily faces her father again wearing her mother's dress, she appears to forgive him and she agrees to return home to June while her father remains at the summerhouse. Emily's depression seems to lift as she faces the future more optimistically, running into the sea to greet Arden, smiling as he photographs her.

Grieves' superior, Nolan, does not approve of his investigation and instead orders him to work on busting the few remaining street dealers, who operate a shrinking black market since the legalisation of all narcotics.  When Grieves continues his investigation, Ambro puts pressure on the police to rein him in.  Eddie Rankin, Grieves' friend and a medical examiner, tells him that an unidentified drug was found in the man's body.  Before Grieves or Rankin can examine it further, Ambro has the body destroyed.  Against orders, Grieves returns to the site of the crime in search of more clues, where he recovers a young woman, Eva Gray, who has apparently been targeted for assassination by unknown forces.  Grieves saves her life, only to find that Gray's assailant has disappeared into thin air.  Grieves attempts to find a place to hide Gray, but his estranged wife, Angie, refuses to help.  Gray, who is also unidentifiable, escapes his protective custody when he is distracted.  When pushed, Rankin reveals he knows a scientist, Yuri Sidorov, who may be able to identify the unknown drug.  After paying off Rankin's debt to Sidorov, the scientist tells him to return in twenty-four hours.  After experiencing further obstruction from Ambro's security and his superiors, Grieves returns early to demand answers from Sidorov.  There, he finds Gray, who, after Grieves threatens to harm Sidorov, reveals that she is a time-traveller from 2044.  Because she is yet to be born, she has no record in Grieves' DNA database.  Grieves dismisses this as the ravings of a junkie and demands to know what Ambro has planned, which he believes may be an experimental drug codenamed "Morlock".  Although taken aback that he knows of the word, Gray sticks to her story.  Ambro attacks Grieves as he transports Gray.  Suddenly, reinforcements appear out of nowhere, disable Ambro's security forces, and disappear with Gray after injecting her with a drug.  After Ambro goons attempt to kidnap his son, Grieves realises that the body he found earlier is the adult version of his 9-year-old son, Ben.  "Morlock" is a code word based on ''[[The Time Machine]]'', a book that Grieves gave to Ben.  Now believing Gray's story, Grieves seeks help from Rankin, who refuses to become further involved.  After Grieves leaves, Ambro orders the police to kill Rankin and kidnap Sidorov.  Grieves has his family flee the city, and, after confronting Nolan, Grieves is also captured.  Todd Ambro explains that they need Ben, as he will perfect their time-travelling drug, which is currently flawed in a way that prevents people from staying long in their destination unless they are dead.  Ambro demonstrates by killing Sidorov and sending his body elsewhere in time.  Desperate to protect his company's future, Ambro demands the police torture Ben's location from Grieves.  After the others leave, Nolan sets Grieves free, saying that he knows Ambro will kill him next as a security threat.  Nolan proposes they work together to escape, but Grieves instead forces one of Ambro's scientists to inject him with the time-travelling drug.  Suddenly in 2044, Grieves speaks to his now-adult son and reinforces how important his mission is.  Back in 2024, Grieves once again discovers the body at Ambro's headquarters, but this time it is his own body, not his son's.

Along the way, the friends learn of the Nutcracker Ball, a tremendous, invite-only Christmas Eve party. Unable to find the party, the friends continue with their tradition. In 2015, the friends decide to end the tradition. Chris has become a famous football player, and Isaac is married, with a baby on the way. Privately, Chris and Isaac worry that Ethan, a struggling musician working at a hotel, is not ready for the tradition to end.  At the hotel, Ethan finds and steals invitations to the Nutcracker Ball. Later, the friends meet at Isaac's house before going out on their last Christmas Eve together. Prior to leaving, Isaac's wife Betsy ([[Jillian Bell]]) gives him drugs to use during the evening, since he has been so supportive. The friends leave to follow their usual tradition, with the intention to go to the party afterward. Their first stop is the Rockefeller Tree. While at the Tree, Ethan reveals the tickets to the ball.

Upon arriving, Chris learns that his teammates did not need the marijuana he struggled to obtain, and they also make fun of him for a video shot of him earlier, with his friends. Isaac retrieves his phone, and learns that Sarah never revealed the  video message he recorded. Ethan finds Diana and, in an improvised moment, proposes to her in front of the entire party with [[Miley Cyrus]]. While she accepts publicly, in private she declines, saying she only said yes because he put her on the spot, and thinks that the only reason why he proposed is because of his fear of losing his friends.  In shame, Ethan goes to the roof, where he sees Mr. Green. Mr. Green reveals that he created and has hosted the Nutcracker Ball since its inception. Mr. Green shares marijuana with Ethan, calling it the [[Ghost of Christmas Past|past]]. Ethan experiences a memory of his friends initiating their yearly ritual. Ethan rejoins his friends, who have been thrown out of the party after an altercation with Chris' teammates.

Mr. Green is also revealed to be an angel, who has been helping the friends to earn his wings. Isaac shows his wife the video, who admits afterward that she is also scared about raising their daughter. The trio spend Christmas at Isaac's house, after which Chris has dinner with his mother and admits to his steroid use. Ethan goes to Diana's house, where he apologizes for how he acted and for not being ready to commit. Diana admits she missed Ethan and accepts his request to finally meet her parents.  One year later, the friends and their loved ones spend Christmas together, and are revealed to be happy, and still friends. Isaac's baby cannot sleep, so the trio serenades her.

Upset, Chris also leaves the party, and Luc follows him, attempting to persuade him to attend another party.  As they drunkenly walk through Paris, Luc suggests they steal a car.  Chris refuses and suggests getting a taxi instead.  Luc snorts cocaine in the cab, further upsetting Chris.  The driver does not react and remains silent during the entire trip, unnerving them.  Luc says he needs to get money from an ATM but runs off, laughing.  Chris apologetically flees the cab, joining Luc.  Luc reveals he has a large amount of cash on him and refused to pay on a whim.  As Chris and Luc argue, the taxi driver stalks them, chasing them down several streets.  Eventually, Luc is confronted by several hostile police officers.  Though Luc protests they have done nothing wrong, their leader searches them and steals Luc's cash.  One policeman declines to accept the money, and the rest split it.  After the police leave, Luc and Chris blame each other for the current situation and something that happened two years ago, only for the taxi driver to chase them again.  They lead him to an underground car park, where a security guard confronts him.  The guard beats his dog when it refuses to attack the driver.  Enraged by the man's actions, the driver beats him and rescues the dog.  The driver once again finds them and chases them through Paris.  Frustrated and unwilling to go to the police, Luc takes them to Detox, a violent gangster.  There, Luc claims that the taxi driver stole his money, which he owes to Detox.  When Detox sees the driver outside his house, he leaves with a sword.  The driver easily kills him, enters the house, and kills everyone but Chris and Luc, who flee.  Finally convinced their danger, Luc calls the police.  Chris looks for a street sign to tell them their location, but the driver hits him with the car.  Now slowed down, they flee again, only to be stopped by the same policeman who earlier robbed Luc.  The police arrest Chris and Luc for the massacre, ignoring their warnings that the driver is nearby.  The driver attacks the policemen but spares the life of the one who refused to take Luc's money.  Luc and Chris rescue a wounded officer and flee into a nearby park in his car.  After the officer dies, they panic, knowing that they have no witnesses left to implicate the driver.

When he fought back, they beat him, accidentally causing him to catch on fire and die.  They discuss the possibility that the driver knows about this somehow and is punishing them.  Luc receives a call from Ludivine, who says the driver has kidnapped her and brought her to a factory.  Luc suggests they abandon her, but Chris refuses.  Chris rescues Ludivine but is overpowered by the driver.  Luc appears and helps him, but the driver easily overpowers both of them.  Chris begs the driver to leave Ludivine alone.  The driver releases her but silently demands that Luc accompany him.  Luc, sure that he is to be killed, enters the taxi.  He is surprised to be put in a jail cell naked.  After an undisclosed amount of time, the driver gives him a book to read that details the history of a secret society of vigilantes that recruits from people who have repented from selfish and violent lives.  Overcome by the realization that he, too, has lived a selfish life, Luc agrees to join the driver's secret society.  After training with him, the driver drops off Luc in front of violent mugging, leaving him to stop it himself.  
Nirbaak
 '''Affection:''' The story begins with the protagonist ([[Anjan Dutt]]) who is schizophrenic, suffering at the same time from multiple personality disorder. He loves his own self. He speaks too less and in his daily routine he plays the role of himself as husband, his wife and he writes letter at the same time to his deceased mother (played by himself). In the opening scene, Anjan wakes up on his birthday, spends lots of time caring self, going out alone and studying a book titled 'Make Yourself Unforgettable' while sitting at a park. Then comes [[Sushmita Sen]] who is also a regular visitor to the park and tries to share her own griefs (although most of the conversations are inaudible to the audience). At the end of the conversation, Anjan gives only one statement 'Love Yourself' and leaves. Later that day Anjan goes to a restaurant and cuts his birthday cake alone, eating it and spreading the cream all over his face (all of these he did in such a way as if he was not actually doing this, as if he was seating with his imaginary girlfriend, wife or live-in-partner). At night, he is being shown as a drunk who has just returned after spending the whole day outside. Then he plays his 'affectionate' part by masturbating while believing that he is on his bed with his partner. Next day he meets with an accident in his bathroom when he slips in his bathtub. He was then shown to be severely injuring his head and was being taken to a hospital.  '''Lust:''' Sushmita lives in Calcutta. She is an author. She loves her city very much and does not want to leave it for the sake of her boyfriend ([[Jisshu Sengupta]]). Here the protagonist is actually a tree in the park, which is visited by Sushmita on a regular basis. She is only shown smooching her boyfriend and the camera is rolled in such a way as if to make us believe that the tree, under which she is sitting, is actually watching her close with lust. Then one day she falls asleep under the tree. The tree is then shown to make love with her platonic ally ejaculating juice from its small branch (which is in the shape of a dick). Then enters Jisshu and the two are talking on the issue that whether Sushmita should leave with her boyfriend. Each time Jissu tries to propose her, the tree distracts him in some way or other indirectly. That night the tree is shown to dream of Sushmita playing sometimes as a beautiful dancing woman and at the other time as a dominant mistress to the tree. But in the same night, Jisshu wins her confidence and she decides to leave with him. On the same night a cyclone strikes Kolkata and  the tree is shown with its branches broken and scattered, the next morning.  '''Jealousy :''' When Sushmita comes to Jisshu's flat in an unnamed city, she is given a not so warm welcome by Jisshu's female dog 'Bingi' (the protagonist). Bingi is actually in love with Jisshu and 'it' thinks Sushmita as its rival stealing all 'its' precious moment with Jisshu. One day when Jisshu was gone for office, 'Bingi' attacks Sushmita and bites her. Jisshu, after returning home, when learns about this, attacks 'Bingi' with his belt. Later Jisshu and Sushmita decides to leave 'Bingi' at Jisshu's mom's place. When Jisshu was driving, Bingi tried to flee causing an accident. In that accident Sushmita dies, Jisshu goes into coma and Bingi remains unscathed.  '''Love:''' [[Ritwick Chakraborty]] plays the role of a caretaker of a morgue who is in love with the dead body of Sushmita. He dreams of dead Sushmita as his love of life. He becomes obsessed with her. The day she is about to be taken from the morgue by her relatives, some goons come in the morgue and tell Ritwick to leave the group leader with one of the dead bodies, possibly Sushmita's. Although the goon's intention was not particularly clarified in the movie, the implied meaning is that the goons were wanting to do acts of [[necrophilia]]. Ritwick protests and the goons mercilessly beat him to death. The time when Ritwick is shown being beaten, a close up of dead Sushmita (now the protagonist) showed as if she was smiling at what Ritwick was doing for her.  '''Separation:''' The film ends with the scene showing that Ritwick is now dead and is being set in the morgue as Sushmita's body at the same time is being taken out, depicting the sense of separation between the two dead bodies.

Nil Battey Sannata
 Apeksha "Apu" Shivlal Sahay (Shukla) is an unmotivated student who has managed to reach her [[Secondary School Certificate|SSC]] year in school despite her lack of interest in studying further. She struggles in mathematics alongside her friends, Sweety (Neha Prajapati) and Pintu (Prashant Tiwari). Her single mother Chanda (Bhaskar), a high-school drop-out, works four different menial jobs, which include working as a maid for Dr. Diwan (Pathak).  Troubled by her daughter's indifferent attitude, Chanda narrates her dilemma to Dr. Diwan, who suggests that she hire a math tutor for Apu. Chanda is told that Apu must pass her [[Board examination|pre-board]] math exams to receive a considerable discount for the tuition. Hearing this, Apu replies that she is destined to work as a maid, as Chanda cannot provide financially for any higher education. With the encouragement of Dr. Diwan, Chanda enrolls in Apu's school so that she can learn math and tutor Apu herself. This embarrasses Apu, and she continuously ridicules her mother. No one, except for the school's principal Mr. Srivastava (Tripathi), is aware of Chanda's relationship to Apu; she manages to befriend Apu's classmates, including Sweety and Pintu, and impresses her teachers with her steady progress. Chanda enlists the help of her shy classmate Amar (Vishal Nath) to understand math and makes use of [[mind map]]s on his advice.  Apu is angered by her mother's success in math, as she herself continues to fail to understand it. Chanda challenges Apu to achieve grades higher than hers in math; if she is successful, Chanda promises to drop out of school. With Amar's help and constant studying, Apu manages to complete the challenge. Her mother is overjoyed, but is heartbroken when Apu informs her that she performed well in school with the sole purpose of ensuring her mother's absence at school. In her anger, Chanda breaks her promise and returns to school, performing even better than before, much to Apu's chagrin. After allotting more time to school, Chanda loses one of her four jobs and begins to work at a restaurant because Amar recommends the job.  One night, she is dropped off at home by one of her male colleagues; Apu witnesses this and assumes that Chanda has been [[Solicitation#England and Wales|soliciting]]. She steals the money that Chanda has been collecting to pay for the math tuition and spends it all on food and new clothes. This devastates Chanda, who becomes depressed when Apu tells her that the money was not hard-earned. Chanda stops attending school and continues to work with the hope that Apu will join the [[Indian Administrative Service]], after she is inspired by a kind [[District Collector (India)|District Magistrate and Collector]] ([[Sanjay Suri]]). In the meantime, Amar helps Apu realise her mistake by making her witness Chanda working at the restaurant. Apu rekindles her interest in school and begins to treat her mother with respect, having realised that she can perform well if she possesses the will. She brings her mother back to school and the duo finish their SSC year together.  With a scenic view of the [[Taj Mahal]], Chanda motivates Apu to always follow her dreams, as they are dependent on efforts and not circumstances. A few years later, Apu attends her [[Union Public Service Commission]] [[Civil Services Examination (India)|Civil Service Examination]] interview, having passed her examinations successfully. After being asked what inspired her to apply for the [[Indian Administrative Service|IAS]], she answers that she is inspired by her mother, who now tutors struggling math students for free.  
No Escape (2015 film)
 In an unnamed South-East Asian country, the Prime Minister closes a deal with a representative of Cardiff, an American company specializing in water systems. After the representative leaves, a group of armed rebels initiate a [[coup d'état]] and assassinate the [[Prime minister|Prime Minister.]]  Seventeen hours earlier, Jack Dwyer ([[Owen Wilson]]), a new Cardiff employee, is flying to the country with his wife Annie ([[Lake Bell]]) and their daughters Lucy ([[Sterling Jerins]]) and Briegel "Beeze" Dwyer (Claire Geare). After landing, they run into a [[British people|Briton]] named Hammond ([[Pierce Brosnan]]) who offers them a ride with him and his friend "Kenny Rogers" (Sahajak Boonthanakit), to the Imperial Lotus hotel, where many foreigners are staying. At the hotel, Jack learns that the phone lines, television and internet are down all over the city. He stops by the bar and chats with Hammond. Later that night Jack awakens and finds his wife in the bathroom crying.  The next morning, Jack goes out to buy a newspaper, and inadvertently finds himself in the middle of a confrontation between armed protesters and [[riot police]] with [[riot shields]]. The two forces clash violently as Jack makes his escape. Eventually, the protesters gain the upper hand and begin killing the police. Jack runs back to the hotel and witnesses the rebels executing an American Cardiff employee out front. A rebel soldier spots Jack, forcing Jack to quickly climb up a fire escape and enter the hotel through a window. The rebels break through the main hotel entrance and begin indiscriminately slaughtering the staff and guests.  Jack makes it back to his family's room, but learns that Lucy is swimming in the pool downstairs. Jack barely gets to Lucy in time before rebels pour onto the pool area. Meanwhile, a horrified Annie sees the rebels going from room to room, killing the occupants. She barely manages to keep them out of their room. As Jack returns with Lucy, he encounters a rebel in the stairwell, but Hammond saves him and tells him to get to the roof. Jack's family go up there and join some of the hotel's guests and staff, who have gathered and blocked the door. On the roof, other hotel tourists warn Jack away from leaning over the edge of the roof, as the rebels below will take a shot at whoever they can see. Jack looks over the roof anyway and sees that hundreds of rebels are gathering at the base of the hotel, and that they have seized most of the city. A French hotel occupant interprets what they are chanting ("Don't resist. There will be no prisoners, because [they're] going to kill [us] anyway.", "Blood for water!") Upon questioning an injured hotel worker, they learn that the rebels are protesting the foreign corporations' control of the water supply. An approaching helicopter is then heard. Everyone's relief turns to horror as they realize it belongs to the rebels, who open fire on the people below. As Jack's family runs for cover, the helicopter becomes entangled in electrical wires and crashes. Another band of rebels breaks through the blocked door and shoot most of the survivors as Jack and his family jump onto the roof of an office building next to the hotel. Jack looks back and sees the rebels holding up the "Welcome" banner from Cardiff with his photo on it, realizing he is a high-value target.  A [[M60 Patton|tank]] targets the office building and fires into it indiscriminately. Jack's family hides under some debris as the rebels swarm the building and murder the employees. The family remains there for the rest of the day, until nightfall with a corpse hiding them. As Jack leaves their hiding place, he is spotted by a looting rebel whom Jack  then kills, much to his, and Annie's, horror. They find a map, take clothes from the dead office workers to disguise themselves as locals, and make their way to the [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States|American embassy]] on a stolen moped. On the way, they manage to ride through a crowd of rebel demonstrators; one man notices they are foreigners, but says nothing, upon seeing the two young children riding with him. Upon arriving at the embassy, they find it overrun and deserted, and have to flee, but not before being seen by a group of rebels, including the leader from the hotel massacre.  The family takes shelter in a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] shrine garden nearby, and are protected by the old [[property caretaker]]. The rebels enter the compound and start searching for them. Jack attempts to steal a gun, and Annie comes out from hiding in order to draw attention away from Jack, while Lucy and Beeze hide. After discovering the gun is unloaded, Jack is beaten and restrained. As the group's leader is about to rape Annie, Hammond and Kenny enter the garden and shoot most of the rebels except for the leader, who escapes. The two men take the family to a nearby brothel, which they pass through on their way to the large tower on the roof. As they eat, Hammond explains that he and Kenny work for the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]]. He and other agents talked the former government into making deals with companies like Cardiff. As these deals allowed the companies to "own" the government through debt, they angered the people, which led to the uprising. Hammond explains that their plan is to get to the nearby river, [[commandeering|commandeer]] a boat, and sail across the border to [[Vietnam]], where they hope to receive [[Right of Asylum|asylum]].  As their children sleep, Annie and Jack tearfully tell each other that they have no regrets on their life together, preparing themselves for the fact that they could likely die the next morning. Before they can enact their plan, the group is attacked by rebels, who kill Kenny and wound Hammond. Hammond sacrifices himself to disable a rebel truck following them. Near the riverbank, Annie and the kids hide as Jack finds a fisherman and trades his watch and shoes for a boat. The fisherman hears the rebels approaching, and hides Jack beneath an old boat. Not long after, the leader who escaped earlier comes back with another group, captures Jack, and prepares to execute him. Lucy leaves her hiding place, distracting the group leader, whose shot hits Jack's shoulder. The leader then catches Lucy, puts a gun in her hand and one to her head and orders her to kill Jack. She refuses, but Jack encourages her to shoot him (to potentially save herself). Before Lucy can make a choice, Annie intervenes and hits the leader in the head, and bludgeons him to death with an oar while Jack grabs the man's gun and kills the remaining rebels.  The family board a boat and paddle downriver toward the Vietnamese border. They are spotted by a group of rebels, but keep paddling. Although the [[Vietnam Border Defence Force|Vietnamese border patrol]] warns the family, at gunpoint, not to enter [[Vietnam]], they take no action to actually stop them, and as soon as the boat crosses the [[border marker]], the border patrol warn the rebels against attacking the family as they are now in Vietnamese waters and if the rebels shoot, [[Casus belli|they will consider it as an act of war]], and would use fatal force against the rebels. As the family is retrieved by the border guards, they embrace each other, having finally reached the end of their ordeal. Later, in a hospital, Jack and Annie narrate to the kids the story of how Lucy was born, a story the two daughters asked to hear about earlier in the movie.

Surprised by Oddball's sudden change in his ability to protect other animals, upon realising that someone might be sabotaging the island to turn it into a whale-watching station he comes up with an idea to save the dwindling number of penguins. Olivia agrees with the idea enthusiastically and names the injured penguin 'Pocket', they begin training Oddball and eventually convince Emily to go on a holiday to Melbourne with Bradley where he proposes that they and Olivia move to [[New York City]]. While Emily and Bradley are away, Olivia and Swampy sleep on Middle Island for the night so they can see if Oddball is up to the challenge, they also release the now healed Pocket back into the wild. Upon seeing that Oddball successfully guards the penguins, Swampy decides to put Oddball on the island alone for a night to see how he copes.   After Oddball successfully fends off a fox and protects Pocket and his Significant other, he and Olivia decide that the dog can guard the birds nightly. After the penguin numbers are steadily rising, Emily accidentally finds out about Swampy's plan after Olivia blurts it out in fear of her knowing, she approves and warns that Oddball could get into trouble if the council finds out.

That night after going home from dropping Oddball off to the island, Oddball tries to fend off a fox but gets shot by a tranquilliser gun off-screen by an unknown person, Swampy declares him missing and accuses Emily of running away after she proposes following through Bradley’s plan of moving away with him and Olivia and says that the sanctuary is done.

Off Course (2015 film)
 Overeducated, [[underemployment|underemployed]] professionals Hugo ([[Yon González]], trained in the financial sector) and Braulio (Julián López, a scientist) are lured to [[migration (human)|migrate]] to [[Berlin]] by a TV programme showing an interview with an [[émigré]] who describes [[Germany]] as [[employment]] paradise. Hugo literally runs into Carla ([[Blanca Suárez]]), a fellow Spaniard who has finally broken through as a professional after a similar struggle with underemployment, within minutes of arriving in Berlin. Hugo and Braulio room with Carla and her drug-dealing slacker brother Rafa (Miki Esparbé), sharing a building with an older Spanish expatriate, Andrés ([[José Sacristán]]), who sees the struggles of his generation echoed in Hugo and Braulio.  A dispiriting, fruitless search for work in their [[professional|trained professions]] ensues, as the [[language barrier]] proves insurmountable. Hugo and Braulio are eventually (under)employed by Hakan (Younes Bachir) in his [[Turkey|Turkish]] café along with Rafa. After his father Próspero ([[Javier Cámara]]) loses his job, Hugo ends up sending most of his earnings (accompanied by lies about his employment status and importance) back to [[Spain]], where his father, his mother Beni ([[Carmen Machi]]), and his fiancee Nadia ([[Úrsula Corberó]]) make a spontaneous decision after hearing his glowing stories to visit him in Berlin. Carla and Hugo have grown close after an initial mutual dislike, with Carla confessing she seems to always end up as "the other woman" in a relationship. Carla relates a story of how she attended a friend's wedding alone, since her boyfriend at the time had another commitment, finding out only at the wedding that said commitment was marrying her friend.  In a subplot, Hakan and his wife Marisol ([[Malena Alterio]]) are unable to conceive a child, despite Marisol's desperation. The doctor informs them that they will undergo tests to determine if one of them is [[sterility (physiology)|sterile]]. While attempting to sell his [[sperm]] to fund German language lessons, Braulio encounters Marisol at the [[fertility clinic]], and she suggests that she could pay for his lessons if he donates sperm "without the middleman." Although she successfully conceives a child, Hakan soon learns that he is sterile and does not believe that he could have fathered Marisol's child.  Another subplot revolves around the irascible Andrés, who is revealed to have an estranged daughter living in Spain. During the course of the movie, he is diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]].  When Hugo's parents and fiancee visit him in Berlin, Rafa, Carla, Hakan and Marisol play different roles as Hugo's employees. Carla is introduced as Hugo's secretary, and Nadia is introduced as Hugo's fiancee. Upon learning this, Carla believes that Hugo is no different than the other men she has dated, seeing herself as "the other woman", and angrily reveals the truth behind Hugo's employment. Meanwhile, Hakan catches Marisol congratulating Braulio for successfully fathering a child and cuts off contact with both of them.  Hugo returns to Spain to work for Nadia's father while they prepare for the wedding.

Ooops! Noah Is Gone...
 Set in the times of the [[Genesis flood narrative|Biblical Flood]], Dave is a Nestrian, a clumsy, silly-looking, brightly coloured creature whose only skills are making comfortable nests and secreting a foul smelling cloud of blue gas whenever he gets scared for his life. Dave is constantly moving around searching for a place to stay, a real home, much to the dismay of Finny, his son, who only wants to make friends. After hearing a rumor of a colossal wave that is said to cover the whole world, Dave packs up again and takes Finny to a giant gathering of animals where their only salvation awaits: a huge [[Noah's Ark|ark]], big enough to fit in all the animals of the world, and built by a very nice human called [[Noah]].  Unfortunately, Dave and Finny are turned away as they're not on the Lion's list. The Lion manages all animal affairs on the ark. But it takes more than that to dissuade a Nestrian. With the use of some creative thinking, some Nestrian craftsmanship, and the involuntary help of the carnivorous Grymps, Hazel and her daughter Leah, they manage to sneak on the ark after all.  Just when the day seemed to have been saved, Dave and Hazel realize that Finny and Leah have disappeared. Their curiosity having gotten the better of them, they were on the scaffolding as the tidal wave hit the boat and it sailed away. The parents panic as the ark sails off, leaving their children stranded on the last bit of land not yet engulfed by the water.  Their desperate race against time begins. Leah, who is a born hunter and survivor is burdened with the clumsy and awkward Finny, but somehow they manage to escape from the rising water and the greedy and gruesome Griffins. Eventually they add two more odd creatures who were also rejected from the ark to their ranks. Finding his footing, surrounded by his new group of friends, Finny starts to emerge as the brave hero that he really is.  Meanwhile, their parents must get over their differences to work together, fight their way through gorilla guards and the vain and ruthless Lion to take control of the ark and save their children.  Having had many adventures, the "fearless four" (Leah, Finny, Obesey and his parasite companion) manage to fight off the continuing attacks of two griffins who see Leah and Finn as their dinner. The gargoyles are eaten by Obesey who falls in the sea some time later.   As the water reaches the top of the mountain where Lea and Finny are, the parents manage to take control of the ship and steer it to the mountaintop. Leah and Finn manage to climb on a piece of floating ice when the water engulfs the mountain.  When the ark passes their little iceberg, it turns out to be hard to climb on. Finny first manages to climb on the ark but does not want to leave Leah behind and jumps back on the iceberg. Then Leah jumps on board of the ark and uses her sharp claws to hold on. Finny tries to get back on the ark too, but falls in the water, seemingly unconscious or dying.  When Dave tries to save Finny from drowning in the water the plot twist is revealed: Nestrians are really water creatures, perfectly able to breathe and swim while submerged. Obesey turns out to be a whale. This also explains why Dave was never feeling at home.  In the final scenes Dave and Finny swim alongside the ark, waving at Leah and Hazel. On the deck of the ark the Lion Captain and his flamingo assistant discuss whether they should have told Dave and Finny in the beginning they were sea creatures.  In the credits is seen when the Ark stops at the [[Mount Ararat]] and when all the animals leave the Ark, and the life of Dave and Finny after the Flood and they discover other Nestrians in the Sea.  
The Ones Below
 Kate ([[Clémence Poésy]]) and Justin ([[Stephen Campbell Moore]]) are expecting their first child. They also have new downstairs neighbors, Jon ([[David Morrissey]]) and Theresa ([[Laura Birn]]), who are also expecting their first baby. Kate and Justin invite Jon and Theresa for dinner so they can get acquainted. During their dinner conversation, it's revealed that Kate and Justin originally didn't want children and were together 10 years before deciding to have a baby, and conceived rather quickly thereafter. Jon and Theresa tell them they struggled for seven years to have a child, and Theresa is visibly upset that Kate got pregnant as quickly as she did while she and Jon had tried for years. Eventually, Theresa, who has been sneaking wine all evening, says she doesn't feel well and gets up to leave. In her rush to get out the door, a tipsy Theresa trips over Kate's cat and falls down the stairs and subsequently loses the baby, whom she was going to name Peter.  When Kate and Justin attempt to console the grieving couple, they end up in a fight with Theresa, who screams that Kate does not deserve "that thing" inside her. A few days later, Kate and Justin receive a note stating that their neighbors have left and will return when they can truly be happy for Kate and Justin's new addition.  Kate gives birth and they name the baby Billy. Not long after Billy is born, Jon and Theresa return, apparently in good spirits. Theresa offers to babysit Billy so Kate can have time to herself. When Kate goes off to visit her dead brother's grave, Theresa leaves the house with Billy, but where she takes him isn't revealed. Periodically, Theresa and Jon are shown out and about with Billy. They’re smiling and look like any happy couple with a new baby.  Kate and Justin go to Jon and Theresa's apartment for dinner. Kate brings the [[baby monitor]], through which she hears breathing. She rushes upstairs to find the bathtub overflowing. Over the next few days, Kate grows increasingly suspicious about the other couple's behavior. Kate leaves Billy with Theresa and then goes back to her apartment to spy on her. She sees Theresa take pictures of Billy and put him to her breast, apparently in an attempt to nurse him. Appalled, Kate breaks into Theresa's apartment and finds the camera with photos of Billy and photos of Jon and Theresa in public with Billy. She also discovers a fully furnished nursery complete with a framed photo of Jon and Theresa holding a baby, presumably Billy. Kate later drags Justin into the couple's apartment only to find that the photos have been wiped from the camera and the picture in the nursery has been changed.  Kate, now on the verge of a complete breakdown, asks Justin to move to a new flat. They find a new place, and he works from home until moving day. This plan is cut short when he's called to work for an emergency. He hands Kate the milk, which she's often seen drinking, as he's leaving and tells her to call the moving van for tomorrow. When Justin reaches the office, he discovers there is no urgent meeting. He then receives an email from Kate stating she's "sorry". He rushes home to find Kate drowned in the bath, apparently having killed herself after tossing the baby into a nearby pond. Heartbroken, Justin moves out, as do Jon and Theresa.  The flashback that follows reveals what really happened: Theresa and Jon drugged Kate via the milk from the bottle Justin handed to her on the way out the door; Jon sent Kate's "sorry" email to Justin from her laptop; and Theresa, dressed in Kate's clothing, threw a bundle resembling a swaddled baby into the pond. It's later intimated that the bundle was Kate and Justin's cat.  The final scene shows Jon and Theresa in their new home in [[Germany]], where they're settling with their baby, "Peter".

A day before December 31, though, Naho confesses her feelings for Kakeru, wherein the latter reveals his plans for suicide.

Our Brand Is Crisis (2015 film)
 In 2002, Bolivian politician Pedro Castillo (a fictionalized version of [[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]]) hires an American political consulting firm (based on [[James Carville]]'s Greenberg Carville Shrum firm) to help him win the [[Bolivian presidential election, 2002|2002 Bolivian presidential election]]. The firm brings in Jane Bodine ([[Sandra Bullock]]) to manage the campaign in Bolivia. The opposition's political consultant is her nemesis, fellow American Pat Candy ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]). In Bolivia the situation is tense: the indigenous people, who are a majority in the country, are protesting for a constitutional reform, to get proper representation.  The American consultants, not knowing the language or the culture, are persuaded by Bodine, a burned out political strategist, to follow a strategy of smear campaigning. However, Castillo refuses to give permission for the team to do so. It is only after publishing a flyer accusing Castillo of a long ago affair (and blaming it on the opposition) does Castillo agree to smear his opponents likewise.  In the following months, the team exercises a strategy of declaring a crisis. They are planning on frightening the people, so they would be persuaded to vote for the unsympathetic but known Castillo rather than the younger oppositions' candidates. Also they publish photos of their enemy with a wanted Nazi war criminal in the background, so that he has to deny being a Nazi. Castillo's bus is stopped by a group of protesters who don't want the International Monetary Fund in Bolivia. Castillo promises not to invite the IMF without a referendum. Eduardo, a young volunteer of the Castillo campaign, is deeply impressed by this. His loyalty comes mostly from the fact that Castillo, who was President at the time, took Eduardo on his arm, during a rally in his town. Nevertheless, his brothers are much more skeptical about Castillo.  During the final debate, Bodine cites a quote in her conversation with Candy, which he gives to Rivera in his speech, saying that "a great man" said it. Unfortunately the quote is actually from [[Goebbels]], the Nazi minister of propaganda and one of Hitler's closest allies. Castillo wins the vote by a small margin. As one of his first actions, he invites the IMF, thereby breaking his promise. The deeply disappointed Eduardo visits Bodine in her hotel, who says that she is not responsible for Castillo's actions.

Carla sits at her desk and picks up the overdue $435 phone bill and angrily calls her daughter Sophie, who ignores her prompting her mother to yank the cord out of the wall. Sophie storms into the clinic and argues with her mother about farm life being solitary confinement and how they should move into the city, Carla counters this by suggesting she help out around the farm or get a job to help pay the phone bill. Henry comes in to let his mother know the man is back. Carla sends the kids in the house and calls for her husband over the walkie talkie.  The man turns out to be a bank manager and during the course of conversation it is revealed that their payments are in arrears and the farm is being foreclosed despite Carla's clinic being a new source of income. The snide and sarcastic bank manager tells them they can take the reduced amount of $200,000 for their barn or be forced out in 48 hours, but Adam refuses to sell as the only reason they are unprofitable is because the sheep keep being attacked and stating that they will never have to leave.

He backs away from the forest as howling begins and large shadows start to pursue him, and rushes back into the house just ahead of the dogs who try to get into the house.  When he goes to get his rifle he notices that there are only two bullets and questions Carla about it who tells them that they have been going missing, although it was revealed earlier in the film to be Henry who is taking them, Carla calls the police and tells them there is a break-in while Adam trains his rifle on the door and shoots through it hitting the dog. He opens the door to see if it is dead and is attacked by it, and accidentally fires off his other round before dropping his rifle which skids out the door. Carla grabs a weapon and begins to beat the dog. A police officer arrives at the farmhouse to investigate and attempts to radio in to the police precinct. He gets out of his vehicle and as he approaches the house the pack viciously attacks him before dragging his body into the woods.

Sophie begins calling him over the walkie talkie which alerts the dog to his presence and it attacks Adam who fights it off with the rifle. Meanwhile, another wild dog is trying to get into the closet and attack the kids but Carla stabs it with a kitchen knife and it runs off. They make an alternate plan to climb up onto the roof of the vet clinic. Adam goes first to snipe the dogs while the kids stealthily go through the interior dog run. Henry stops to spread some liquid to distract wolves and to collect some unused rifle shells he has hidden there. Carla has been making firebombs from flammable liquid she had in the house to throw at the dogs while the kids run across the last patch of lawn to the ladder. The leader of the pack sees Carla and runs toward her. As she runs back for the house she sees it closing in on her. She goes to the pick-up truck instead and climbs through the back window to get the tire iron and beat it. She fights it off long enough to get the truck door open. As it leaps through the window and she slams the door, closing the dog inside. She hides under the truck but is soon dragged out by the dog. As she sits at the side of the truck with the crowbar still in hand, the lead dog approaches her slowly snarling and showing his teeth.

Grandma Lois takes the girls upstairs while the same entity takes the camera with them.

Leila's interactions with Toby coincides with Ryan using the old camera around the house, where he notices the camera picks up [[Spirit photography|spiritual beings]]. He later decides to roll the tapes overnight to see what weird things are occurring. One night, a black figure arises out of the ground and hovers over Leila for several hours, and she eventually talks to it. Soon, Skylar walks in and checks on Leila, only to be attacked by the spirit. The next night, Ryan tapes Leila sleeping, but a dark and demonic spirit appears on camera and forces him to drop the camera. The following day, Ryan and Emily go out for the night and leave Skyler and Mike to take care of Leila. After experiencing the entity outside, they discover a slab of concrete in the ground with Katie and Kristi and the year 1987 etched in it. They discover their house is built on the same property that Katie and Kristi used to live in before their house burned down in 1992.

Ryan researches the cult, and realizes they killed [[Paranormal Activity 4|a family in Nevada]] related to a boy named [[Paranormal Activity 2|Hunter]], who was born on the same day as Leila. One of the tapes Ryan found also shows Leila with Kristi, Katie and Hunter in 1992, a few years before she was born. He also learns that Leila's blood is needed to finish Toby's transformation into a physical being. One night, Leila's interaction with Toby leads her to open a doorway to another realm into which she disappears. Ryan and Emily find her soon after, but flee with Leila to a hotel.  Father Todd comes back and attempts to cleanse the house. He decides to trap the demon, upon which the demon violently shakes the house. Todd is strangled and dragged away by Toby, leaving the family to finish the cleansing. Ryan entraps the demon in a white sheet and finishes reciting a prayer. Leila returns to normal and the demon disappears. After thinking the ordeal is over, Skylar starts to vomit blood all over Mike, but the blood burns him, killing them both. Leila then flees, and Ryan and Emily chase her upstairs, but Ryan is killed when a large arm impales through his chest. Leila sprints away into the "portal" in her room with Emily following her; she arrives at Kristi and Katie's mother's house in 1992, where she finds a young Katie and finally confronts the "human" version of Toby. Emily pleads with the demon to spare Leila, but is killed and her body is tossed at the camera as it flips over. Leila identifies the demon "Toby" and the two walk off as the camera cuts off, ending the film.  === Alternate ending === In this film the same ending begins as Leila turns back to normal. Four months later the family begins to move to another house which contains all the boxes in the truck; Ryan drops a box and finds a VHS tape regarding young Katie and Kristi, but then decides to destroy the evidence to avoid sending the demon back to their residence. To another shock, Emily turns to find Leila with younger Katie and Kristi holding hands as she states: "Look, mommy, my friends are here!" The next scene shows a pregnant Emily lighting a birthday cake, which turns out to be set at Leila's birthday party and that she wishes for a baby brother. The man from the home ritual videos then appears, picks up Leila, and wishes her a happy birthday. Everyone celebrates by eating cake. The screenshots then cuts to black as the film ends.

 The police use serial killer Uragami to identify parasites among humans, as he has a special ability to detect them; however, he is unable to correctly identify Shinichi Izumi. A few months after the events of [[Parasyte: Part 1|the previous film]], Shinichi continues to track down and kill the parasites who terrorize the human world for food, with help from Migi, the parasite that infects his right hand. He learns that he is being tracked by Shiro Kuramori, a reporter hired by parasite Ryoko Tamiya. Shiro discovers the truth about Migi, and plans to expose Shinichi. Shinichi tells Shiro that Tamiya is a parasite, and urges him to stop getting involved for the sake of his safety. Tamiya meanwhile, has given birth to her human son and slowly learns how to become a mother, growing furiously protective of her baby and killing her fellow parasites when they threaten him.   Despite Shinichi's warning, Kuramori goes on to record his conversation with mayor Takeshi Hirokawa, who secretly heads an organization composed of parasites. Hirokawa orders the parasites to kill Kuramori, but they are only successful in killing his daughter. Swearing revenge, Kuramori kidnaps Tamiya's son and calls her to a park so she can see him kill the baby. Despite Tamiya and Shinichi's attempts to convince him otherwise, Kuramori almost goes through with his plan, resulting in his death at Tamiya's hands. When Tamiya then approaches Shinichi, the police fatally shoot her.  Instead of defending herself, Tamiya protects her child, explaining to Shinichi that she now knows what it is to be human. She hands her son over to Shinichi before dying, reminding Shinichi of his own mother.   At the same time, a secret service team evacuates the town hall upon discovering Hirokawa's true alignment. They are able to kill nearly all of the parasites as well as Hirokawa himself, who turns out to be a human who supports parasites and distrusts humans. The remaining parasite, Goto, turns out to be too powerful for the team, as his body contains five parasites. He massacres the team and begins his pursuit of Shinichi. Cornered at a forest, Migi sacrifices himself to allow Shinichi to escape.  Shinichi mourns Migi and is comforted by his girlfriend, Satomi Murano. The next morning, Shinichi discovers that a part of Migi is still in his right hand, thanks to his body being infected with Migi's cells in the previous film. He lures Goto to a disposal facility and is able to fatally injure him. At first reluctant in killing him, Shinichi ultimately decides that he wants to protect his loved ones, and finishes Goto off. Back home, Migi tells a dismayed Shinichi that since the parasites have died down, he will now go into hibernation to achieve an evolution, presumably up to the point where the two will never see each other again, breaking Shinichi's heart.  A few years later, Shinichi and Satomi visit the now toddler son of Tamiya, who is named Taiki Tamiya. Afterward, Uragami appears, kidnaps Satomi, and takes her to a roof. He states his belief that humans are the real monsters and asks for Shinichi's opinion, since he is certain that Shinichi is a parasite. However, with Satomi's encouragement, Shinichi defies Uragami's opinion and successfully saves Satomi with help from Migi, who had momentarily awakened from his dormant state to help him.  
Parched
 Parched is the story of four women in a desert village of [[Rajasthan]], [[India]]. The village and the society are plagued by several social evils, age-old traditions and practices of patriarchy, child marriage, dowry, marital rapes and physical and mental abuse.  Rani ([[Tannishtha Chatterjee]]) is a widow struggling to support her old mother-in-law and teenage son, Gulab ([[Riddhi Sen]]). Following village customs, Rani marries Gulab off to a child bride by paying a hefty sum to the bride's family. Meanwhile, Gulab is disrespectful, rebellious, and prefers to loiter with a gang of spoilt friends, and spend time with sex workers. Janki ([[Lehar Khan]]), the child bride, hopes to stop the marriage by chopping off her hair but is still forced into the relation. Lajjo ([[Radhika Apte]]) lives in the same village as Rani, and is a close friend and aid in Rani's struggles. Lajjo is in an abusive marriage with an alcoholic husband, Manoj (Mahesh Balraj). Having failed to conceive, Lajjo is mocked for being infertile and therefore worthless in the eyes of her husband and society. The fourth woman is Bijli ([[Surveen Chawla]]), an erotic dancer in a travelling entertainment company. She is eye candy for the men in the village and doubles as a sex worker. Because of her profession, Bijli is ridiculed in the day and not welcomed at auspicious events. Bijli is a close friend and advisor to both Rani and Lajjo.  The movie begins with Rani and Lajjo visiting another village to see Janki and fix a price for her dowry. Meanwhile, Gulab is seen loitering around a bus stop with his friends. He chases and teases an educated woman, until her husband, Kishan ([[Sumeet Vyas]]) approaches. Gulab and his friends comment that it is inappropriate for a woman to travel alone and look at them directly in the eye. While at Janki's house, Rani receives calls on a cell phone bought for her by Gulab. The anonymous caller started off as a wrong number but now consistently tries to charm her. Although Rani is excited by being approached by a man, her happiness wanes when she realizes that her status as a widow may push him away. Later, at the [[Gram Panchayat]], the village participates in solving local issues. The first issue is of a girl named Champa ([[Sayani Gupta]]) who ran away from her husband and tried to return to her parents. The Panchayat forces her to return despite her revelation that her husband's male family members all rape her. Kishan and his wife try intervening but are ridiculed for their progressive opinions and Kishan's marriage to an educated, working woman from Manipur.  Kishan is a forward thinking local entrepreneur and employs women in the village for handicrafts and handloom jobs. Both Rani and Lajjo, among other women in the village, work for Kishan and are proud of the money they make from their hard work. In another matter at the Panchayat, the women collectively ask for a satellite dish TV connection.

First they destroy his handicraft goods, and later on they beat him half to death, which makes Kishan and his wife to leave the village.

She resorts to engaging in traumatic rough sex with multiple men in order to make money which leads them to raping her.  Rani discovers that her last bit of savings has been stolen and blames Janki. Later that night, Janki questions Gulab about the money, and he begins to beat her. Rani stops and confronts him, and Gulab angrily walks away, saying that he intends to leave the women to fend for themselves. The next day, Rani sells her house and pays off her debts.

Working with a team – Donna, Saul, Khan, and Gino – Paul is able to clumsily dismantle Vincent's operation, with Maya severely incapacitating Vincent by rubbing oatmeal-infused concealer on his face.

One of Will's art students, Kat ([[Jessica Williams (actress)|Jessica Williams]]), asks him to dinner so that he can meet her single mother, Diane ([[Regina Hall]]).

He stops to read Kat's graphic novel: titled "Mother Fuckers," it chronicles her mother's struggles with dating as a single mother, depicting Diane as becoming more disappointed and heartbroken with every breakup. Will finds Kat again, who is angry at him for hurting her mother, and gives her his own set of drawings to look at, drawings of him struggling with letting go of Charlie that he had been creating throughout the film. Later, she visits him at his home and gives him back his work, telling him that she could tell who it was about and that he needs to let Charlie go. She also flips to a panel he'd drawn of her mother and tells him that she showed it to Diane, and that Will should call her again and rekindle their relationship.  On the day of Charlie's wedding to Gary, Will attends but finds Charlie absent. Gary is trying to call her, and Will confronts him, punching him (after warning him) but also telling him that he knows Gary loves Charlie. Afterwards he goes and finds Charlie, who is afraid of making "another mistake," but he tells her that he never considered their relationship a mistake—just something that worked until it didn't. They decide to remain friends, and Charlie marries Gary. Will leaves on his own with some stolen flowers from the wedding, presumably to go visit Diane.  
The People vs. Fritz Bauer
  Bauer's driver finds his boss unconscious in the bathtub. He is taken to the hospital, while the police, politically motivated, suspected a suicide attempt. His opponents - especially Attorney General Kreidler and Paul Gebhardt of the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Federal Criminal Police Office]] (BKA) - triumph.  During Bauer's recovery, a file disappears from his office. He then cites the prosecutors and asks them about progress in the persecution of Nazi criminals. However, the prosecutors can not show anything. The young prosecutor Karl Angermann reminds Bauer that he received the file in question with the request of him, Bauer, to draft a statement. Bauer gets the feeling that he can rely on the young man, and invites him to a meeting on the weekend to his home, because he imagines in his authority as "in the enemy country". Bauer wants to bring [[Adolf Eichmann]] from [[Argentina]] to a German court. However, since the BKA and [[Interpol]] are not responsible for political crimes, Bauer is considering engaging Israeli intelligence service [[Mossad]].   With the receipt of a letter from Argentina, Bauer learns that Eichmann lives there under a different name. He passes on the letter to the Mossad and speaks in Israel as well. The Mossad boss [[Isser Harel]] already checked this trail, but wants Eichmann to be abducted only if Bauer has a second proof.  Angermann asks Bauer for advice on the sentence in a homosexual trial. After Bauer's reference to a similar process, Angermann then demands a sensationally low penalty. Victoria, a friend of the defendant, thanks Angermann and invites him to the nightclub "Kokett". Angermann falls in love with the woman who turns out to be a trans woman. At the same time, the BKA has photos of bed scenes made of both of them and tries to blackmail him with them.  When Bauer discovers that the former Nazi Schneider at [[Daimler-Benz]] works in the human resources department for South America, he puts pressure on him to obtain Eichmann's code name in Argentina. He directs this to the Mossad to confirm the first lane. Eichmann is abducted in the sequence in Argentina by the Mossad and abducted to Israel. Bauer's application for extradition of Eichmann is rejected by the federal government under [[Konrad Adenauer]], as there are extensive arms deals between the [[BRD (Germany)|FRG]] and Israel and is feared by possible statements of Eichmann in front of a German court, a government crisis, as many former Nazis are represented in the state apparatus up to the Cabinet.  Angermann can not be blackmailed with compromising photos and turns himself in for violating § 175.  Bauer, who temporarily thought of giving up, then plunges into the Nazi investigation, which eventually lead to the [[Frankfurt Auschwitz trials]].

The Phoenix Incident
   ''The Phoenix Incident'' begins with the [[night vision]] observation of a [[scorpion]], moving across the screen before cutting to a series of military [[shootout|firefight]] engagements in [[Damal]], Turkey, [[Deir ez-Zor|Dayr Az Zawr]], Syria and [[Mogadishu]], Banadir, Somalia, often with alien cries heard during these engagements. Expository text explains that, since 1997, the United States military has been engaged in a covert war against "forces of unknown origin", and that "57 incidents have spread across Asia, Europe and Russia." It goes on to note that [[NATO]] notes that alien invasion forces will reach populated areas within two years, and that the conflict itself is in retaliation for an incident in Phoenix, Arizona on March 17, 1997. The film notes that it is dedicated to "members of the intelligence community who provided evidence that made the film possible".  Tying into the film's viral campaign, the film introduces the disappearance of four Arizona men. Heaven's Gate cult member Walton S. Gayson, initially held as a suspect in the murder of the four men, was taken into federal custody. Later, the search for the men was suspended, concluding that the four men had been killed in a [[American black bear|bear]] attack, a conclusion which the local medical examiner denies, but was ordered to list as the cause of death.  The documentary style film moves between two complementary plotlines; the first is a filmed interview with an unidentified Air Force pilot who exposes, despite likely repercussions, the truth about what happened to four missing civilian men on the Phoenix Lights. The second plotline comes from recovered filmed footage ("The Lauder Tapes") by one of four men: Glenn Lauder (Lowenthal), Mitch Adams (Willingham), Ryan Stone (Baker) and Jacob Reynolds (O'Brien). Lauder cannibalizes several different cameras, even [[duct tape|duct taping]] a camcorder to the side of his [[All-terrain vehicle|ATV]] helmet. It is from these cameras that most of the footage is derived.  The interviewed officer details how the military detected the approach of a triangular-shaped object in the tail of the passing [[Hale-Bopp comet]] until it began to descend into Earth's atmosphere over Arizona. Later, the object goes missing and two [[Key Hole|KH satellites]] in the area had stopped transmitting.  The men decide to go out to the foothills by the Estrella Sierra to spend time together and ride their ATVs. Mitch, whose brother was a former [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] is excited about the trip, his friends substantially less so. While packing their truck for the trip, the men notice a growing military air presence in the area, first helicopters and then [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15 fighter jets]] and [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10's]], as well as odd atmospheric disturbances. When they embark on their trip in Ryan's truck, which suddenly breaks down in the foothills. Jacob tries to repair the damage to the vehicle while the others try to find someplace call for [[Roadside assistance]]. They come across a desert compound, protected by an electrified fence, owned by reclusive Heaven's Gate cult member Walton S. Gayson (Adamthwaite). A highly agitated Gayson accosts Jacob at the truck, warning them that he must leave immediately. Despite the warning, the men set off in their ATVs into the foothills.  Further questioned, the Air Force officer details how several "[[Multiservice tactical brevity code#B|bogeys]]" had entered [[Nevada]]'s [[airspace]] before turning towards Phoenix. By this time, several eyewitnesses had already seen the multiple crafts, and Operation Snowbird goes into effect: a diversion operation to distract the civilian population with [[Flare (countermeasure)|decoy flares]] while an aerial [[dogfight]] ensues between Air Force jets and the unidentified craft at the [[Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range]].  The four men witness the dogfight when an alien craft is disabled and crashes into a nearby hill. Mitch's brother had been killed in a helicopter crash, so he decides to try and render aid to what he presumes is a human pilot. Upon reaching the downed craft, before the military can respond, the men are attacked by defensive creatures that faintly resembles man-sized scorpions; Jacob is severely injured in the attack. Their ATVs are destroyed by the aliens, and they take refuge in Gayson's compound. Gayson, a former Heaven's Gate cult member, has been awaiting the coming of the creatures for years to be abducted and taken to a "higher plane" of existence, and turns off the electric fence, letting the creatures in.  In the final act, Jacob is taken, and Mitch is killed attempting to defend the men. Ryan and Glenn are almost rescued by a military helicopter, but it is shot down. Ryan is dragged off by one of the creatures and Glenn's helmet coming off as screams fill the air. Gayson later finds the helmet and recovers the camcorder's film.  In a post-credits scene, after his release from prison, a clean-shaven Gayson douses himself in gas and sets himself afire, preparing to 'rise above this world". The scene leads viewers into the online viral campaign, revealing how the Lauder Tapes were discovered.  
Phantom (2015 film)
 The movie begins with a car chase in [[Chicago]], which leads to a scuffle between a man ostensibly named Jude Rosario ([[Saif Ali Khan]]) and an American male known as Matthew Broody. The scuffle ends with Broody falling into the icy waters of [[Chicago River]], and his body missing. This results in Rosario being arrested and convicted for murder.    A flashback of six months ago shows the office of the Indian [[Research and Analysis Wing|RAW]] chief Roy ([[Sabyasachi Chakrabarty]]), where he and his trusted men ([[Rajesh Tailang]], [[Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub]]) plan a daring covert operation. The man, known as Jude Rosario in the opening sequence, is shown to be Captain Daniyal Khan, a dead-end ex-soldier with a completely deadened sense of life and death who is pulled out of oblivion and pressed into service by the spy agency to wreak vengeance on the men who planned the [[2008 Mumbai attacks|26/11 Mumbai terror attacks]]. He agrees on the assurance that he will be reinstated in the Indian army to the same rank from which he was court-martialled, which meant regaining the respect of his estranged father and mentor, Dilawar Singh. His only team member, Nawaz Mistry ([[Katrina Kaif]]) helps him find his first target Sajid Mir ([[Mir Sarwar]]) at a cricket match in [[London]]. On reaffirming his identity after breaking into his apartment, Daniyal rigs up an explosion which kills Sajid, which makes the headlines explaining it was accidental, causing an investigation by the Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]].  Coming back to the present, Daniyal aka Jude has landed in the same jail as [[David Headley]] ([[J. Brandon Hill]]), his next target. He contacts Nawaz, in order to acquire money to buy a battery, as a replacement of another one which holds a certain poison. The poison is untraceable as it could kill a person whose tongue even comes in contact with it with a heart attack. After killing David Headley by plugging the poisonous battery into a [[shower]]head he usually uses, Matthew Broody, who supposedly died upon falling in the river, is found alive and Daniyal is released as his earlier sentence is rendered null and void. Meanwhile, ISI agents gather information about him.  Daniyal and Nawaz, through [[Syria]], go to [[Pakistan]] to take down the last two perpetrators, Sahabuddin Umvi and [[Hafiz Muhammad Saeed|Haaris Saeed]] ([[Shahnawaaz Pradhan]]). There, they make plans of killing Saeed with the help of local restaurant owner and [[sleeper agent]] Khalid ([[Middat Khan]]), by an explosive planted in the mic used during his public rally. However, their plan fails leading Daniyal to pursue Saeed in a car and shoot him dead, also causing an explosion. Umvi is killed with the help of a nurse Amina Bi ([[Sohaila Kapur]]), a mother who lost her [[Lashkar-e-Taiba|militant]] son in a [[suicide attack]], who replaces his regular syringe with one with poison.  With the Pakistani army and ISI pursuing them, Daniyal and Nawaz make their way to the coast to escape through the [[Arabian sea]]. Their accomplices get caught and interrogated for information or killed. While they are escaping on a boat, the Pakistani military finds out about it and sends patrol boats to apprehend them. While hiding in the waters with Nawaz, Daniyal gets shot by the military and dies, while Nawaz later gets rescued by the [[Indian Navy]], after they leave. Later, she goes to the [[The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel|Taj Hotel]] and has two cups of tea, fulfilling a promise earlier made to Daniyal.

On the way, the group encounters many incidents, including Rana on the verge of losing patience due to Bhashkor's fussy behaviour and constipation. They finally reach Kolkata, where Piku's relatives live in the old house and Bhashkor asks Rana to stay for some time. Piku and Rana go out in the city and gradually grow close.

He remembers Rana who had told him to eat everything and not be choosy and picky about food. Piku is secretly happy but does not emote much.

The Phoenix Project (film)
 Perry Frank assembles a team of four young scientists to take part in an experiment to reanimate the dead.  The group consists of himself, his friend and protege Carter Watts, biologist Devin Fischer, and engineer Ampersand "Amps" Garner.  Although Devin and Amps are privately dubious about Carter's usefulness, the team members express their optimism and excitement for the project in taped interviews that Perry arranges.  Perry explains that their funding only allows for five subjects, so they must proceed slowly and carefully.  As they set up the equipment, Amps and Carter bond.  Devin confides to Perry that his father, a scientist, experienced his greatest regret in having his work finished by later teams, and Devin says he wants to push this experiment all the way.  Their first subject is an insect.  When the experiment fails, Devin suggests that since the experiment was designed around mammals, they should abandon tests on insects.  Perry reluctantly agrees, and Amps recalibrates the equipment for a mouse.  Carter, initially supportive of the idea, becomes reluctant when it comes time to kill the mouse, which the others refused to let him name.  The experiment is once again a failure.  Carter and Devin give up for the day, but Amps convinces Perry to set up a second test on the same subject.  Amps becomes demoralized when this also results in failure.  When Carter walks through the lab that night, he notices the mouse's body has moved.  He excitedly wakes the others, and they celebrate.  Carter later approaches Perry privately and cautiously suggests that one of the team members may have moved the mouse to raise morale.  Perry reassures him that he has the situation under control.  Further tests prove failures.  Frustrated, Devin requests Carter contact the grant organization and request money for more tests.  Carter is incensed when he finds that Perry has lied to them; there is no grant, and Perry is bankrolling the experiment privately.  Carter quits the project, citing legal and moral implications, though Devin elects to stay.  Perry and Devin do not explain the situation to Amps.  Devin pushes for a larger mammal, which he says will be easier to test, and Perry allows the use of a rabbit, though he cautions Devin that to maintain public acceptance they must avoid animal testing on anything larger.  Devin and Perry become further estranged when Perry learns Devin has joined to project for personal reasons – his sister is near death, and Devin intends to reanimate her.  Perry angrily reminds Devin that human experimentation is not possible.  After promising results, Amps' updated calculations reveal that the second subject, the mouse, could not have moved.  Perry admits that he moved the mouse himself, and Amps says that he needs time away from the project.  Devin pushes Perry to perform another test without Amps, and they experience their first unqualified success.  Although initially angry they would operate his machine without permission, Amps also becomes excited.  Perry contacts Carter, apologizes for lying about the grant, and requests that he rejoin them.  Carter returns once he hears about their success.  Meanwhile, Devin convinces Amps to secretly test on a human subject.  When Perry finds out, he threatens to call the police.  Seeing no alternative, Devin commits suicide to force them to test the machine on him.  The result is initially a success, but the others are quickly horrified to learn that Devin's memory and personality have been wiped; he does not even understand how to speak.  Perry orders them to destroy the equipment, and they leave the lab with Devin in tow.  As they put him in a car, Devin stares wide-eyed at the world around him.

Pitch Perfect 2
  Three years after winning the [[Pitch Perfect|previous competition]], the Barden Bellas are now led by Beca Mitchell ([[Anna Kendrick]]) and three-time super senior Chloe Beale ([[Brittany Snow]]). The Bellas have become [[International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella|ICCA]] champions each of these three years. However, the group becomes involved in a national scandal, dubbed Muffgate, when a wardrobe malfunction causes Fat Amy's ([[Rebel Wilson]]) pants to rip in front of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]], showing her genitals to the public since she did not wear underwear, leading to the Bellas' suspension from the ICCAs. Beca makes a deal to allow the Bellas to be reinstated should they win the World Championship of a cappella.  Freshman Emily Junk ([[Hailee Steinfeld]]) begins her college career, hoping to follow in her mother Katherine's ([[Katey Sagal]]) footsteps by being a Bella. At orientation, she watches an a cappella performance by the Treblemakers, now led by Beca's boyfriend Jesse Swanson ([[Skylar Astin]]) . Benjamin "Benji" Applebaum ([[Ben Platt (actor)|Ben Platt]]), Jesse's best friend, overhears Emily, leading to a crush on her.  The Bellas learn that Das Sound Machine (DSM), a German powerhouse group, have replaced the Bellas on their victory tour. Additionally, Beca has started an internship at a recording studio, Residual Heat, something only Jesse knows.  Emily goes to the Bellas' sorority house to audition for them because of their absence from the auditions. When she sings her unfinished song "Flashlight," she succeeds in joining the Bellas.  At a car show where the ICCA winners are due to perform, the Bellas scout their replacements, DSM, led by intimidating duo Pieter Krämer ([[Flula Borg]]) and Kommissar ([[Birgitte Hjort Sørensen]]), who take delight in mocking the all-girl group. Later, the Bellas are invited to an exclusive riff-off against DSM. Also in attendance are the Treblemakers, Tone Hangers (a group of former Treblemakers, including Bumper ([[Adam Devine]]), and the Green Bay Packers. The Bellas make it to the final two, but end up losing to DSM in the final round when a nervous Emily flubs an attempt to sing "Flashlight," her original song not from the right category ("90's Hip-Hop Jamz").  The next day at the warmups, the Bellas' chances of winning end in disaster when the performance sets Cynthia Rose's ([[Ester Dean]]) hair on fire by pyrotechnics. Even before then,  John ([[John Michael Higgins]]) and Gail ([[Elizabeth Banks]]) question the Bellas' identity. In order to regain harmony and sync, Chloe takes them to a retreat led by former leader Aubrey Posen ([[Anna Camp]]). Beca starts a heated debate with Chloe over herself being the only one thinking about life beyond the Bellas and Chloe's obsession with winning Worlds.  To prove to her boss that she can produce music well, Beca offers Emily to produce "Flashlight" at the studio. The group realizes that they will no longer be together and may go their separate ways after graduation, and regain harmony by singing "Cups (When I'm Gone)." At the studio, Emily and Beca present their song to Beca's boss, in which he demonstrates envy for their talent and looks forward to producing with them.  The senior Bellas graduate and they all head off to [[Copenhagen]] for the World Finals, with Jesse and Benji to cheer them on. They perform a harmonized version of "Flashlight" with Aubrey, Katherine, and other past Bellas joining in. The Bellas win the championship and repair their damaged legacy. As the senior Bellas leave Barden, they give Emily a belated proper initiation with Fat Amy showing her how to do the last tradition: christening the house by sliding down the staircase.  In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Bumper performs on ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'', chooses [[Christina Aguilera]] as his coach and makes her uncomfortable when he gives her an oddly lengthy hug.  
Pixels (2015 film)
  At a video-game arcade in 1982 with his friend Will Cooper, 13-year-old Sam Brenner discovers he can master the games by spotting patterns. Participating in a video-game championship, he loses in a match with obnoxious arcade player Eddie Plant in ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''. A [[videocassette]] with footage of the event is included in a [[time capsule]] that is launched into space.  33 years later, Brenner has become an installer of [[home cinema|home-theater systems]] while Cooper is the President of the United States. In [[Guam]], a [[Andersen Air Force Base|U.S. military base]] is attacked by UFOs of ''[[Galaga]]'' that turn pieces of the base into small glowing cubes and one of the soldiers is abducted.  While working at the home of divorcée Violet Van Patten and her son Matty, Brenner is summoned to the [[White House]]. To his surprise, he finds Violet is also headed there as a lieutenant colonel. Upon seeing the video footage and meeting with Ludlow "The Wonder Kid" Lamonsoff, a friend he made at the video game tournament, Brenner determines the aliens have found the videocassette images to be a declaration of war and are attacking with a spacecraft resembling those of their classic video games. This is affirmed when the aliens interrupt a television broadcast, challenging Earth to a battle where if the aliens win three rounds, they will conquer the Earth. Brenner and Cooper are unable to stop one of the attacks as ''[[Arkanoid]]'' paddles sling balls of light to destroy the [[Taj Mahal]], and another person is abducted.  Brenner and Ludlow train [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEALs]] to play the old games. Violet develops light cannons that are effective against the aliens. In London, the aliens attack in the form of the video game ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'', but as the soldiers are unable to beat them (as they forgot to shoot at the heads), Brenner and Ludlow step in and shoot them down. Following the victory, the aliens send congratulations and a "[[Achievement (video gaming)|trophy]]" in the form of the dog from ''[[Duck Hunt (video game)|Duck Hunt]]'' to an old woman (who appeared earlier at the London attack).  Ludlow and Cooper retrieve Eddie, who had been serving a prison sentence for fraud. In New York City, the team discovers it must participate as the [[Ghosts (Pac-Man)|ghosts]] against [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]]. [[Toru Iwatani]], the creator of ''[[Pac-Man]]'', tries to confront him, but he gets his hand bitten off and flees. Using [[Mini Cooper]] cars, Brenner, Ludlow, and Eddie overcome the task, but Violet notices that something about Eddie is off, as he moved at supersonic speeds around the board. They win [[Q*Bert]] as a trophy, but the aliens (as [[Hall & Oates]]) later declare that someone cheated and the contest for the planet has been forfeited. Matty discovers Eddie used a [[Cheat codes|speed cheat]], thus revealing that he is the one who cheated. When the aliens' mothership suddenly appears, Eddie flees from it, while Matty is abducted by the aliens.  As revenge for Earth cheating, the aliens launch a massive attack using characters from all sorts of classic video games in Washington, D.C. Cooper joins the team, while Ludlow stays to fight. An alien takes the form of Lady Lisa, a character on whom Ludlow had a crush since childhood. Ludlow persuades Lady Lisa to choose love, and she sides with the humans; Eddie, wishing to make amends, returns to fight as well. Brenner, Violet, and Cooper are summoned to the mothership where they face the alien leader who takes the form of [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] on the game's starting level with the aliens' captives at the top. As the group dodges barrels and fireballs, Brenner feels depressed and loses hope, until Matty reveals to him that Eddie was cheating, restoring his confidence, and Brenner eventually throws a hammer to defeat Donkey Kong. The aliens' characters then self-destruct.  The team is hailed as heroes and a peace agreement is reached with the aliens. Eddie apologizes to Brenner for cheating in his life. Although Ludlow is saddened that Lady Lisa is gone, Q*Bert transforms its likeness to Lady Lisa. Brenner and Violet become a couple, while Eddie gets to meet [[Serena Williams]] and [[Martha Stewart]]. A year later, Lady Lisa and Ludlow are married and have Q*Bert children.  
The Piper (film)
 In the 1950s after the [[Korean War]], a gentle wandering piper with a limp, Woo-ryong, and his sick young son, Young-nam, are en-route by foot to [[Seoul]] through the central Korean highlands when they reach a remote village.  The village chief allows Woo-ryong and his son to stay at his house. The piper shows the Chief an English-written note that he says is the name of an American doctor at a hospital in Seoul who can treat Young-nam. The Chief, who tells the piper not to tell anyone else the war is over, agrees but he cannot read English either. Woo-ryong is smitten by a villager called Mi-sook who lost her husband and child in the war.  Woo-ryong quickly sees that the village is plagued by rats that do not fear humans and do not fall for traps and poisons. The chief explains he and his people came here when they heard Chinese soldiers were approaching their old village. They hid the village lepers in a cave with the village's original [[Korean shamanism|shaman]]. But when the Chinese had not reached the village, they returned to the cave but found all the lepers were dead and being eaten by rats. The vicious vermin then invaded the village because it had no shaman to keep them out.   Woo-ryong volunteers to get rid of the rats in exchange for the price of a pig that will help pay for his son's medical treatment. He spreads a special powder across the village and goes to a nearby hilltop. Checking the wind direction he lights a very smokey fire that smothers the village in smoke. At the same time, Mi-sook, who has been forced by the chief to become the new village shaman begins a purification ritual with bells. Rats start pouring out of the buildings following Woo-ryung's powder to a cave.  Mi-sook starts to fall in love with Woo-ryung due to his kind nature. The son even starts to call her "mummy". However, the chief threatens her if she plans to leave the village. He also plots with his son, Nam-soo, to not reward the Piper for getting rid of the rats. First they create doubt in the mind of the male villagers making them believe that Woo-ryong is a communist spy who brought the rats with him. At a village meeting, the chief says he is going to pay the piper but a dead cat is found. Proof the chief says that the rats are back. He holds up Woo-ryung's English note and says its spying material; it simply reads "Kiss my ass, monkey" - no American doctor's name just a cruel joke. Woo-ryung reaches for the money but Nam-soo chops off two of his fingers with a knife. The villagers turn on Woo-ryung and Young-nam, even Mi-sook condemns them. But as the villagers get ready to throw them out, Mi-sook returns in a shamanic trance but stabbed in the stomach. She tells the villagers that on a day without sun they will all die and their children might live or die, repeating the prophecy made by the village's original shaman just before she was burnt alive by the villagers. Mi-sook then dies from her wounds.  Before they leave, the Chief puts two poisoned rice-balls in Woo-ryung's knapsack. The injured piper falls asleep while his son sneaks back to the village to retrieve his father's pipe from the Chief's house. On the way back, Young-nam eats one of the poisoned rice-balls and dies.   Woo-ryong sets out on a revenge. After burning his son's body on a funeral pyre that makes so much smoke it blocks out the sun, he covers himself in the special powder he used earlier to attract the rats and reopens the cave. He uses his two severed fingers as bait and starts playing his pipe to lead the rats back to the village where they devour all the adults including the chief and his son. Next morning only the villagers' children are alive, Woo-ryung plays his pipe and leads them to the cave where he trapped the rats. After sealing them all in, he turns and looks hard into the camera.

Play the Game (2015 film)
  While standing in front of a shelf in a supermarket, a young man, Adam, is approached by a mysterious woman, Isabel. In contrast to Adam's casual outfit, Isabel’s appearance is strikingly exquisite. Her red lipstick matches the color of her dress, high heels, toe- and fingernails. She is graceful and acts perfectly cool. Isabel gives Adam a red envelope. He opens the envelope and finds a note stating: “PLAY THE GAME – OR SOMEONE WILL DIE”. This marks the beginning of a series of mysterious events. Confused with what has just happened, Adam finds himself alone. He follows Isabel and succeeds to scribble her black car’s licence number on the envelope. Puzzled, Adam walks to a nearby pub, where he is a regular. In front of the pub, he encounters two guys playing poker. Being distracted by the game, Adam bumps into a man on his way into the pub. The man apologizes and each of them continues his way.  The man crosses the street and walks to Isabel's parked car. It turns out that he has stolen Adam’s wallet, which he gives to Isabel. She opens it and takes out a business card with Adam’s address. Immediately, Isabel heads for his apartment. Meanwhile, Adam is sitting on a bar stool in the pub, telling Ruby, the barkeeper and his friend, about the incident in the supermarket. Ruby reads the note and asks a couple of questions about the red-dressed woman. Finding that she is a complete stranger to Adam, Ruby advises him to go to the police. Since Adam rejects to do that, Ruby then suggests that he calls his Italian ex-girlfriend, Fabiana, having in mind the Italian licence number of Isabel’s car. Adam is reluctant, admitting that he hasn't called Fabiana for a long time. When he is about to leave, he realizes that his wallet is missing. Ruby suggests that he has probably forgotten it at home.  Meanwhile, Isabel breaks into Adam’s apartment. In the living room she puts his wallet on a table and places a miniature surveillance camera on a shelf. When Adam suddenly enters the front door, Isabel is forced to hide on the balcony. Adam finds his wallet on the table and goes to take a shower. This allows Isabel to sneak out of the apartment.  Having showered, Adam decides to call his ex, Fabiana. When he is about to sit on his couch, he bumps into a chess board and all the chess pieces fall down. Fabiana is in her office at the police station and is perplexed when Adam calls her. He asks her to check who the owner of the black car is. When she realizes that this is the only reason for Adam's call, Fabiana is outraged, but finally agrees to do him the favor. The whole conversation is witnessed by Isabel, who can spy on Adam thanks to the surveillance camera she has left in his apartment. The fact that Adam gets in touch with the police makes her angry and prompts her to write another note saying, “Calling the cops is against the rules. Meet me tonight 10 pm, Hotel Moser Verdino, room 318”.  After a while, Adam receives a call from Fabiana. She informs him that she has checked the licence number and found out that the car belongs to a person, who died two weeks ago. She adds that the car has been stolen. During this conversation, Adam rearranges the chess pieces. When a police commissioner, Roberto, enters Fabiana’s office, she is distracted by his appearance and it becomes obvious that they are in love with each other.  When Adam leaves his apartment to have a drink at Ruby's bar, Isabel prepares to break into it again to leave the second note there and to retireve her camera. Before he leaves, Adam moves the king’s pawn on his chess board from position e2 to e4. Later, when Isabel is in the apartment, she leaves a red envelope with the note on the chess board and moves the queen’s pawn from d7 to d5.  Adam is again in Ruby’s bar. He tells Ruby that he has followed her advice to call Fabiana. Then the two of them play pool, discussing the recent events. Adam explains that in case he knows Isabel’s address, he will not hesitate to go there and ask her about the rules of the game.  Back in her hotel room, Isabel takes a box from under the bedside table and takes out a gun. She checks the loaded drum magazine and hides the gun under a pillow. Then she prepares to take a bath. She takes off her clothes and her black wig. With her long, blonde hair she looks strikingly different.  At the same time, in her office, Fabiana seems to be concerned about Adam. Similar to Isabel, she also opens a small box. Inside, she finds a key and a photograph showing Adam and herself. She takes the key and prepares to leave. She drives from Udine to Klagenfurt, where Adam lives. When she enters Adam’s apartment, using the key from the box, she looks around the familiar place. She notices the red envelope, reads the note and, obviously alarmed, rushes off. Around this time, Adam, who has just lost another pool game, leaves Ruby’s bar. In his apartment he, too, reads Isabel's message. Realizing that he is already late for the appointment, he quickly heads for the hotel. When he enters the lobby, he does not notice that he is followed by the mysterious man who has stolen his wallet. Inside the dark hotel room 318, Adam finds Fabiana's dead body soaked in blood. Deeply shocked, he hears the entrance door being slammed shut.  On another day, Isabel again enters the supermarket. This time, she drives a fancy red sports car and wears a black dress matching her high heels, toe- and fingernails. She approaches Ruby, who is standing in front of a shelf. Ruby is surprised, but obviously the two women know each other, since they address each other by name. Isabel gives Ruby a red envelope and leaves. Ruby takes out a note. This time it reads “PLAY THE GAME – OR YOU WILL DIE!”  
Point Break (2015 film)
 [[Extreme sport]] athlete Johnny Utah ([[Luke Bracey]]), and his friend Jeff ([[Max Thieriot]]), are traversing a steep ridgeline on [[motorbikes]]. The run ends with a jump onto a lone stone column, where Jeff overshoots the landing and falls to his death.  Seven years later, Utah is an [[FBI]] agent candidate. He attends a briefing on a skyscraper heist, in which the criminals steal diamonds, escaping by parachute, in [[Mumbai]]. A similar heist happens over [[Mexico]] where the criminals unload millions of dollars in bills over Mexico, then disappear into the [[Cave of Swallows]]. Utah's research concludes that they were done by the same men, who are attempting to complete the Ozaki 8, a list of eight extreme ordeals to honor the forces of nature. They have already completed three, and Utah predicts they'll attempt the fourth on a rare sea wave phenomenon in France. After presenting his analysis, Utah is sent undercover to France under a field agent named Pappas ([[Ray Winstone]]). They reach France and Utah gets help from others to surf the tall tube wave.  As he goes in, there is already another surfer riding the wave, leaving Utah unstable. Utah gets sucked into the wave and faints, but the other surfer bails and rescues Utah. He wakes aboard a yacht with the surfer, Bodhi ([[Édgar Ramírez]]), and his team Roach ([[Clemens Schick]]), Chowder ([[Tobias Santelmann]]), and Grommet ([[Matias Varela]]). They leave him to enjoy the party and he gets acquainted with a girl, Samsara ([[Teresa Palmer]]). The next day, Utah finds the men in an abandoned Paris train station after he overhears them talking about the location. Bodhi gives him an initiation fight and soon he is accepted into the circle. They travel to the [[Alps]] for the next ordeal, [[wingsuit]] flying through the cliffs "The Life of Wind". The four succeed in their attempt and spend some time together with Samsara. The next day, they climb the snow peaks for the sixth ordeal, snowboarding down a steep mountain of snow. They reach their spot, but Utah decides to extend his line, so the others follow him. Chowder slips and falls to his death, and Utah becomes depressed about it.  After a party, Samsara explains that she and Bodhi both knew Ono Ozaki when they were young, that her parents died in an avalanche accident and Ozaki gave her a home after. She explains further that Ozaki actually completed his third ordeal, despite what was widely believed. He did not die attempting the ordeal, but was actually killed by a [[whaling]] ship crashing into his boat while he was trying to save [[humpback whale]]s. On his boat, a young boy, Bodhi, decided not to tell the truth of his story but to finish what Ozaki started.  Next they travel to a gold mine where Bodhi detonates explosives Grommet and Roach planted. After blowing his cover, Utah chases Bodhi, managing to trip his bike. Bodhi escapes because Utah cannot stand up after the crash. The FBI freezes Bodhi's sponsors' assets; Bodhi plans to rob a nearby Italian bank on a mountain top. Utah and the police intercept the group, resulting in a crossfire that kills Roach. As the group flees, Utah chases and shoots one of them to death, who is revealed to be Samsara and not Bodhi.  Utah finds the location of the next ordeal: [[Solo climbing|solo rock climbing]] with no safety beside [[Angel Falls]] in [[Venezuela]]. He finds Bodhi and Grommet and chases them on the climb, but Grommet falters, falling to his death. Utah catches up to Bodhi, but he falls backward down the waterfall, completing what would have been the last ordeal; Bodhi has to redo the fourth ordeal because he bailed out on the wave when he chose to save Johnny. Seventeen months later, Utah finds him in the [[Pacific]] facing another giant wave. As Utah tries to get Bodhi to come back with him and pay for his crimes, he eventually lets Bodhi attempt to surf it, both knowing that he will not come back. The wave engulfs Bodhi, and Utah continues his career in the FBI and begins going through his own eight ordeals.  
Pokémon the Movie: Hoopa and the Clash of Ages
  Around one hundred years ago, in a desert town that would become Dahara City the Pokémon [[Hoopa (Pokémon)|Hoopa]] Unbound appears boasting how strong it is. It summons [[Kyogre]] and [[Groudon]] from its interdimensional rings. Hoopa Unbound battles them back and impresses the townspeople. Hoopa Unbound asks the townspeople if they were surprised. When Hoopa Unbound appears again, he summons [[Reshiram]], [[Zekrom]], and [[Regigigas]]. The battle between all the [[Legendary Pokémon]] begins to destroy the town. The townspeople cry out to stop, but Hoopa Unbound is determined to show off his power. Suddenly, a man appears with an [[Arceus]] necklace around his neck. The man holds an item called the Prison Bottle. Hoopa Unbound is sucked into the bottle. The man saves the town and halts Hoopa Unbound's rampage.  Years later, Baraz is searching for the Prison Bottle in Arche Valley. In a cave, after using [[Solrock]]'s flash to see, he discovers the bottle. He is delighted and grabs the bottle. However, Baraz gets possessed by the dark power within.  Meanwhile, [[Ash Ketchum]] and his friends [[Pikachu]], Serena, Clemont, and Bonnie are relaxing at a Pokémon Center near Dahara City. Ash and Bonnie swim. Clemont works on an invention. Serena brings out donuts for everyone. While they enjoy the donuts, they begin to disappear into Hoopa's portals. Ash finally spots the arm reaching out in time to grab hold. Ash and Pikachu are pulled through Hoopa's portal. They find themselves on the other side of Dahara City with Hoopa. Hoopa asks if they were surprised. Ash says that he is very surprised. Wanting to delight Ash even more, Hoopa names Ash ''Ashkan'' and Pikachu ''Pikan''. Hoopa opens two portals, where hundreds of Pikachu come through. This includes a full set of cosplay Pikachu. Ash is startled to see so many Pikachu. When Hoopa quizzes him on which one is his own, Ash finds Pikachu within a single moment. Hoopa seems let down that Ash did not have a harder time.  Meray appears, and tells Hoopa to return all the Pikachu it "borrowed". Pikachu gets up on the railing to command all the other Pikachu to return, which they do, impressing Hoopa. Meray introduces herself as one of the caretakers of Hoopa. Ash then drags Clemont, Bonnie, Serena and all their stuff through the rings. They decided to visit the tower and thought it would be easy to go through the rings to get there. However, only Hoopa is unable to pass through its own rings. They decide to walk instead of passing through Hoopa's rings.  Baraz arrives on his Braviary and instantly opens the Prison Bottle. The darkness envelops Hoopa, who transforms into Hoopa Unbound. Baraz returns to normal, and both he and Meray are very happy to see that Hoopa Unbound got its power back. But Hoopa Unbound instantly begins to smash things, its tail destroys a doughnut shop, and it throws a piece of a building at the heroes. Pikachu counters with Thunderbolt destroying the piece and accidentally blasting Team Rocket off again as they were plotting to steal the bottle.  They get Hoopa Unbound's power back into the bottle. Ash and his friends quickly learn that by touching it, they will be possessed by the evil power within the bottle. Clemont happily shows off his new invention. It is a device that can hold the bottle up with electric waves. The device carries it in his Aipom arm, which prevents anyone from touching it. Hoopa is absolutely terrified of the bottle and the power inside of it by shaking and whimpering.  They sit down to eat. Baraz explains Hoopa's story. One hundred years ago today, Hoopa Unbound began to appear in the town. Hoopa Unbound ate the food and caused problems. The townspeople came to love it when he would battle Pokémon to entertain them. Hoopa Unbound made the townspeople very happy. It also brought much gold. Dahara City grew from a tiny village to a great city. Only when it began to summon more powerful legendary Pokémon and grew more obsessed with showing off its power even if it destroys the town, the townspeople had to do something to stop it.  The man who stopped Hoopa was Meray and Baraz's great grandfather. They show off their Arceus necklaces, and Ash thinks he recognizes them. Clemont explains Arceus is the one who is said to have created all things. Meray and Baraz explain how their family is connected to Arceus' power. They tell how their great grandfather could use it to control Hoopa, who would throw great tantrums screaming for him to give back its power. Meray and Baraz grew up with Hoopa like siblings, getting into mischief and playing together, even healing Hoopa when it grew very sick when taken to Arche Valley. It is clear that they love Hoopa as family. They taught it many things about helping others and getting along with people. Their great grandfather accepted Hoopa as family.  [[Team Rocket]] appears in their balloon, thinking the Prison Bottle will up their Pokémon. The instant [[Meowth]] takes hold of it, though, he becomes possessed, and opens the bottle to unleash Hoopa Unbound's power. Hoopa fights the power, too afraid of vanishing if they become once again, and is able to keep it at bay, but Hoopa Unbound then develops as a separate Pokémon. In the struggles, the Prison Bottle explodes. Hoopa summons [[Lugia]] to fight Hoopa Unbound after Team Rocket is blasted off and Baraz's [[Braviary]] is defeated. Lugia distracts Hoopa Unbound as they make their escape.  Meray and Baraz know that they can make a new bottle at the tower with the power of earth, fire, and water. They decided to use Serena's [[Braixen]], Ash's [[Frogadier]], and using a ring, Bonnie goes to the desert to ask for a [[Hippopotas]]' help, and bring it along. Ash stays with Hoopa while the rest head over to the tower to make a new bottle.  While hiding from Hoopa Unbound, who is still fighting Lugia, Ash and Hoopa begin to talk. Hoopa promises that once strong enough, it will make any of Ash's wishes come true. Ash says that his wish is to become a Pokémon Master and Hoopa says that it will make it happen. Ash refuses, though, saying that is a dream he plans to attain by himself. Hoopa is absolutely shocked that Ash plans to attain his own dream without using any rings or magic wishes. Ash talks to Hoopa about how this Hoopa Unbound seems to be a shadow of Hoopa, and it needs to learn to make with itself to solve this crisis.  Hoopa Unbound appears in a ring and searches for them with its giant hand. Right when they were about to be caught, Lugia appears and carries them away on its back. Hoopa Unbound tricks Lugia into flying into a ring and sends it back to its ocean home. Ash and Hoopa are powerless. Hoopa summons [[Latias]], [[Latios]], and a shiny [[Rayquaza]]. Ash, Hoopa, and Pikachu ride on Latias and Latios, while Rayquaza helps to battle Hoopa Unbound. Ash commands the Pokémon to attack, but Hoopa Unbound summons Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, [[Dialga]], [[Palkia]], [[Giratina]], and [[Kyurem]].  At the tower, the others are hard at work making a new Prison Bottle, using the powers of fire, earth, and water. Clemont commands Frogadier, Bonnie commands Hippopotas, and Serena commands her Braixen, while Meray and Baraz use their powers. The bottle begins to form.  When the six legendary Pokémon summoned by Hoopa Unbound begin to attack, Latias, Latios, and Rayquaza all Mega Evolve. Kyurem becomes Black Kyurem and then White Kyurem as the all out brawl continues over the city. Mega Rayquaza creates a twister around Dahara Tower to protect it. The others reforge the Prison Bottle. However, Hoopa Unbound and the legendaries break through the twister. The bottle is made again, but Baraz drops it. Ash catches it but gets possessed by the evil within. Shadow Ash plans to destroy Hoopa, but Hoopa tries to cleanse him with his happy memories. Ash returns to normal and realizes that the evil is gone. All the legendary Pokémon roar. Hoopa states that they were surprised. However, due to too many legendary Pokémon being summoned, a void warp was formed around the tower. All the legendary Pokémon could not stop it. Hoopa transforms into Hoopa Unbound and lets everyone escape. At the end, Meray and Ash leave with only Baraz and Hoopa left. Baraz and Meray try to help Hoopa escape. Arceus temporarily slows down the void warp. Hoopa remembers the words of the traveler who happens to be Baraz and Meray's great grandfather and considers Baraz and Meray family. Hoopa decides to stay with them. Hoopa finally manages to go through the ring with Baraz at the last second. At the end, the void warp leaves a decimated tower and city. Arceus leaves through the clouds. All the other legendary Pokémon return to their homes. At the end, Clemont suggests going back to Arche Valley. Hoopa declines and says that he has unfinished business. Hoopa wishes Ash the best on becoming a ''Pokémon Mister'' (Pokémon Master).

 After receiving a warning not to come to their family lake house in Maine, siblings Lyla and Ed stage an intervention for their brother, Martin, a dishonorably discharged veteran who believes the military has experimented on him.  When they arrive, they find that he has descended into apparent paranoid psychosis and claims to have trapped a monster in the basement.  Martin explains that he found a pod while hunting in the woods and believes it to be part of a government conspiracy to create artificial, inanimate assassins.  Martin subsequently pulled several of his teeth to find what he believes is a tracking device.  However, since he destroyed it, he can not prove it to his siblings.  When Ed demands to see what is in the basement, Martin refuses to let him and reveals infected scratches across his torso, which he says were made by the trapped creature.  Ed, a mental health professional, insists they take Martin back to the [[VA hospital]] where he was previously institutionalized after attacking a nurse, though Lyla wants to hear more of Martin's side of the story.  Martin overhears Lyla and Ed discuss taking him back to the institution and confronts them with a knife.  As they try to talk him down, Martin announces that they are all going to die anyway and slices his throat.  As Ed attempts to stop the bleeding, Lyla panics.  Ed forces her to go downstairs and call for help, but she discovers Martin has cut the phone's cord.  Unknown to them, he has also sabotaged their car.  After Martin dies from blood loss, Ed kicks open the barricaded basement door.  Lyla begs him not to go down, but Ed says he must check if there is an injured person held captive.  Ed initially finds nothing in the darkness, and when he turns on a light, it blows a fuse.  Flipping the power back on reveals a humanoid creature, confirming that Martin had actually been telling the truth. The creature immediately attacks Ed.  Ed barely escapes back up to the house.  After telling Lyla to flee the house, Ed becomes disoriented as he remembers that Martin said the monster had some kind of hallucinatory venom.  He slows down the monster by stabbing it with a syringe that contains a mild sedative he had intended to give Martin, then retrieves Martin's rifle.  As the monster recovers and tries to rush him, Ed shoots it.  Meanwhile, Lyla discovers the car will not start and runs to a nearby house.  After banging on the door to no effect, she stops a passing motorist, identified later as Smith.  Smith calmly questions her, says the creature is not a government conspiracy, and kills her with a shot to the head.  Back at the house, Ed deliriously celebrates his victory against the creature, which he has repeatedly struck with the butt of the rifle to make sure it is dead.  As Ed calls out to Lyla, saying that it is safe to return, hearing this, Smith shoots and kills him. Smith contacts someone on a cell phone and reports that the creature is dead, though he does not know whether there is a nearby colony of them. After giving his coordinates, Smith hears a noise behind him. The creature, still alive, attacks and kills him as he turns around.

 Eric and Amy Bowen are a married couple looking to buy a house for themselves and their three children: 16-year-old daughter, Kendra, their 9-year-old son, Griffin, and 6-year-old daughter, Madison. Eric was recently laid off, but they are shown a house that has recently come on the market that fits their price range, so they purchase it and move in.  The first night, they hear strange noises in the walls, and Griffin finds a box of clown dolls that were left at the house. In the middle of the night, lights and electronic devices start turning on and off, as some unseen force appears to move through the home. The commotion wakes Griffin, and he goes downstairs and finds Maddie talking to an unknown presence inside the television. She tells Griffin someone is coming, and he attempts to unplug the TV, causing the lights to go out of control. Maddie then tells the family: "They're here" while touching their TV screen that has the ghost's hands pressing against the other side of the screen. The following evening, Eric and Amy go to dinner with their friends, leaving the three children at home. They learn that their house was built on an old cemetery, but the bodies were moved to a better neighborhood.  At the house, Kendra wakes up to a strange sound outside. She then puts on her [[Ugg boots|uggs]] and goes outside. Kendra slowly walks outside and steps in mud causing her to fall inside a slippery hole. She tries to escape, but fails. She claws at the ground to keep herself from slipping further down. Kendra screams for help when a corpse's hand emerges and begins pulling at her foot. Griffin notices the clown dolls seem to be moving by themselves. One clown doll attacks him, but he destroys it and escapes from his bedroom. He finds Maddie in her room, scared, crouching in a corner, and tells her to stay while he goes to find Kendra. Maddie is then lured into her closet and becomes lost in an unending void. As she sees her bedroom drifting away further, she is dragged into the darkness by ghosts. Griffin, while running around the house, is grabbed by the branches of the old tree outside their house, which pulls him out to be hanging on the tree. Amy and Eric arrive home to see Griffin being tossed around in the tree branches, which releases its grip when they come close, while Kendra tells them she can't find Maddie.  The family hears Maddie's voice emanating from the television. Amy reaches at the television's screen while Maddie's static hand is seen to be touching Amy's hand on the other side of the screen. Amy and Griffin visit the Paranormal Research department for help. The staff sets up equipment in the house, and install [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] devices on everyone in the house. While trying to contact Maddie, Eric is ambushed in the closet by a ghost resembling her. Angered, he breaks down the closet wall, throwing a chair into the darkness inside the closet, and as the chair falls back into the living room of the house, it reveals a possible [[Portal (fiction)|portal]] Maddie can escape through. The investigators realize that this haunting is a [[poltergeist]]. The lead investigator, Dr. Brooke Powell, decides to call occult specialist and television personality Carrigan Burke (revealed, much later, to be Powell's ex).  Carrigan explains that Maddie is a possible psychic, able to communicate with spirits. He reveals that the ghosts are trapped and are angry because only the headstones were moved to the new cemetery, but the bodies remained, and plan on using Maddie "to free them from their [[purgatory]]". Carrigan comes up with a plan to get Maddie back. He anchors a rope in Maddie's room and tosses it into the vortex. They attempt to use Griffin's toy [[Drone aircraft|drone]] to guide Maddie out, but it is immediately destroyed by the ghosts when inside the portal. Griffin, guilt-ridden over leaving Maddie alone in the first place, goes through the portal himself. When he finds Maddie, the ghosts attempt to destroy the rope to trap them, but Griffin and Maddie grab onto the rope and are brought back through the portal.  The family get in their car and begin to take their leave from the house, but the ghosts drag them back into the house and attempt to abduct Maddie again. The family saves her from being sucked into the portal, and Carrigan decides that as the only other psychic, he must go into the vortex and lead the spirits into the light. The Bowens flee as the house is destroyed by the spirits soaring into the sky as a beacon of light. The investigative team run to their equipment, looking for a sign that Carrigan managed to get back.  As the Bowens look for a new house, the realtor shows them a house with lots of closet space and an old tree in the backyard; the Bowens drive away laughing. During the end credits, it's revealed that Carrigan survived the incident and is back filming his ghost program, now hosting the show with Dr. Powell.

David finds an old camera with a video recording of his seventh birthday party, in which he briefly spots his 17-year-old self in a reflection. Noticing how he appears to be reaching for a basement light switch in the reflection, David and his friends go to the basement, which was forbidden by his father. Underneath a trapdoor activated by the basement switch, the group find the blueprints of a [[time travel|temporal relocation]] device that Ben was developing named "Project Almanac", and use the available resources to build a functional time machine. David, Christina, Adam, and Quinn later use the battery from the car of David's longtime crush, Jessie Pierce ([[Sofia Black D'Elia|Sofia Black-D'Elia]]), to charge up the machine, and successfully send a toy car back in time, but blow out the power for the entire neighborhood. They end up being caught by Jessie and recruit her to their experiment.  David, Jessie, Christina, Adam, and Quinn eventually travel back in time to the day before and break into Quinn's house, where he draws a smiley face on the back of the neck of his sleeping past self (which simultaneously appears on the back of the visiting Quinn's neck). However, he awakens and seeing his future self causes a feedback loop that nearly erases them both from the timeline. The five agree to use the machine for personal gain on the condition that they always use it together. Adam uses it to win the lottery, Christina gets back at her bullies, Quinn aces a chemistry test to secure his academic future, and the group eventually decides to travel back to [[Lollapalooza]] three months before. David hesitates to declare his feelings for Jessie during a particularly open and obvious moment in their conversation, and their relationship becomes awkward. David decides to travel back to Lollapalooza alone to change that, leading to a future in which they are a couple. When he returns, he finds that the blackout caused by them sending the toy car back resulted in their school's star basketball player getting hit by a car and breaking his leg; the team doesn't make it to the championships, and those that would have attended go elsewhere, including the player's father, a pilot who ends up crashing a commercial airliner, along with multiple other catastrophes around the world. David goes back alone once again and prevents the accident that would lead to the player's injury, and averts the plane crash. He returns to the future to learn that instead Adam is in critical condition in the hospital after being run over.  David continues to travel back in time to rectify the poor outcomes, but eventually is caught by Jessie during one of his trips, accidentally sending her back with him. Jessie confronts David, who is forced to admit to using the time machine to win her affection. As Jessie lambastes David for his deception, her past self runs up, causing another feedback loop, and Jessie is erased from the timeline. David decides to go back to prevent the machine from being created, but the machine is out of hydrogen. As David returns to the present, he is confronted by the police, who suspect him of being connected to Jessie's disappearance.

Psycho-Pass: The Movie
 In 2116, [[Akane Tsunemori]] leads Division One of the MWPSB—composed of her, Inspector Mika Shimotsuki and Enforcers Nobuchika Ginoza, Sho Hinakawa, Yayoi Kunizuka and Teppei Sugo—in an operation against foreign terrorists who have infiltrated Japan. A gunfight breaks out when the team intercepts the terrorists in a parking area, resulting in the deaths of several terrorists while the rest are captured. Back at the MWPSB headquarters, Chief Kasei orders Shimotsuki to have analyst Shion Karanomori conduct a "memory scoop" procedure on one of the men without Akane's knowledge. By the time she learns of this, the memory scoop has already been performed, recovering images of Akane's old colleague [[Shinya Kogami]] among the terrorists. After consulting Professor Joji Saiga for advice, Akane applies for and receives permission to travel to the Southeast Asia Union (or SEAUn), a [[superstate]] which has begun to import the [[Psycho-Pass#Setting|Sibyl System]] technology from Japan. Ginoza requests permission to make the trip as well, but is refused, so he asks Akane to punch Kogami for him. She promises that she will instead bring Kogami back alive, so that Ginoza may do it himself.  Akane is received at the SEAUn airport by a military procession under the supervision of Colonel Nicholas Wong. En route to the [[Arcology|coastal city]] of Shambala Float, where the Sibyl System is being put into effect, Wong explains to her that Dominators are not used in the country, and due to a lack of resources, latent criminals are instead fitted with collars that will deliver a lethal dose of poison if their Crime Coefficients elevate. Akane is then introduced to Chairman Han, SEAUn's leader. She is warned not to travel outside of Shambala Float, as she cannot be protected by the Sibyl System from the terrorists outside its walls. Akane spends a day in Shambala Float and observes the way its Sibyl System operates.  The next day, Akane accompanies Wong and his men on a military operation outside Shambala Float. During the battle, she spots Kogami on a monitor and heads out to confront him. She manages to overpower and capture him, but when Wong's drones endanger her in an attempt to kill Kogami, they are forced to flee together. Wong thus declares Akane to be a terrorist as well. Kogami brings her to the base of the terrorists, who are [[freedom fighter]]s striving to free their nation from Han's [[military dictatorship]] and the Sibyl System. Meanwhile, Wong contacts mercenary leader Desmond Rutaganda and hires his team to find both Akane and Kogami.  That night, Kogami explains to Akane that he was unable to find a purpose after escaping Japan, which he found in trying to help the resistance in SEAUn bring freedom and justice to their country. Further, he suspects a much larger conspiracy is unfolding, due to Han's full alliance with Sibyl despite being a dictatorial ruler. Akane expresses fears that he is becoming like [[Shogo Makishima]], which Kogami adamantly rejects. He reveals to her that the terrorists who appeared in Japan were not sent by their movement, and acted with help from an unknown sponsor. Rutaganda and his mercenaries suddenly attack the camp, killing many of the resistance soldiers. Kogami manages to help Akane escape before he is captured, and Rutaganda elects not to pursue her.  Back in Shambala Float, Akane is arrested by Wong and slated for deportation, but saved when Han arrives to overrule the colonel. She returns to her apartment and releases "pill bug" drones to allow Karanomori to hack the Sibyl drones in the area. Shortly afterward she is drugged by her personal assistant, who is being blackmailed by Wong. Akane awakens just in time to see Wong betray their deal and murder the assistant in cold blood, leading her to realize the same truth Karanomori has discovered: the Sibyl System in Shambala Float has been tampered with to ignore Wong and the rest of the city's military, allowing them to act with impunity despite being latent criminals with severely elevated Crime Coefficients. Meanwhile, Rutaganda has Kogami savagely beaten despite being fascinated by him, but refrains from killing him.  Wong and his men bring Akane to a [[helipad]], where Rutaganda's group arrives with Kogami via helicopter shortly thereafter. He reveals that he plans to have them both executed, then use the helicopter to stage their deaths as the fault of a Japanese terrorist as part of a [[false flag operation]] to increase his own military power. Prior to the execution, Rutaganda taunts them with the information that "Chairman Han" is actually a Japanese impostor, and the real Han has already been assassinated. Suddenly, the drones present turn on Wong's men and begin gunning them down, having been reset by Karanomori to accurately detect their Crime Coefficients. The rest of Division One arrives in a helicopter, and Ginoza hits Wong with a shot from a [[sniper rifle]] Dominator, killing him instantly. In the ensuing bloodbath, all of Wong's men are killed, along with all of the mercenaries except Rutaganda himself. Kogami escapes to pursue Rutaganda, urging Akane to go after Han and discover the truth about the conspiracy. Akane teams with Ginoza to do so, while leaving the others behind to secure the helipad, though they split up afterwards.  While searching for Rutaganda, Kogami is confronted by a vision of Makishima, whom he imagines taunting him over the futility of his efforts. Kogami confronts and fights Rutaganda, but he is overwhelmed until Ginoza appears and assists him. Together, the former partners manage to kill Rutaganda and escape a suicide bomb set just before his death. In Han's office, Akane scans him with the Dominator, revealing a Crime Coefficient of zero. It becomes apparent that Han is criminally asymptomatic and a Sibyl android, much like Kasei. Through both the Dominator and Han's body, Sibyl reveals to Akane that they engineered the entire chain of events, creating a need for the system in SEAUn before manipulating Akane with information about Kogami via the terrorists to go there and ultimately uncover Wong's plans, thus allowing Sibyl to fully seize control of the country. Disgusted with these blatantly unlawful actions despite Sibyl's claims of justification via SEAUn being a [[failed state]], Akane confronts the system through Han, demanding that they have Han resign and hold a free, fair election. Akane's insistence on having the people vote on whether or not they want something they already desire amuses the Sibyl System and it grants her wish. Elsewhere, Ginoza allows Kogami to escape after finally getting to punch him, warning that they should never see his face again because of the trouble he causes for Akane.  The next day, Han makes a televised statement, claiming that Wong's failed coup has caused him to rethink his government and announce that he will indeed resign so elections can be held. Leaving the security of Shambala Float and SEAUn in the hands of the remaining, uncorrupted military, Division One departs to return home to Japan.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Kogami watches a child soldier attempt to learn how to fire an assault rifle and overhears a radio broadcast revealing that Han is winning the election. The film concludes with a voiceover by Akane, promising that someday soon, the true value of the Sibyl System will be examined.

He and Manthagini find her performing the Kanya Puja on Pavazhamalli. After a bitter sword fight with the Queen, he manages to destroy the staff, thus restoring the Queen to her normal self.

Ayesha's mother, Dr Aarti returns from Pune and is shocked by the news. Remy tells the police that the family's other servant, Chetan, has also been missing since Ayesha's murder. It is also revealed that Ayesha was pregnant and had a boyfriend named Riyaz. Evidence from the early stages of the investigation lead the detectives to believe that Dr Sachin is the prime suspect, and he is thus taken under judicial custody. The case goes to CBI and Officer Sunil Paraskar ([[Kay Kay Menon]]) takes charge. Not convinced with the evidence, he begins a fresh investigation.  He soon discovers that Sachin is having an extra-marital affair with Brinda ([[Mita Vashisht]]), a former actress who is married to Sachin's colleague, Dr Hansal. Hansal is aware of the relationship and the couples frequent stays in a five-star hotel. Once, while following Sachin and Brinda, he spots Ayesha and Riaz in the same hotel. Sachin also sees his daughter and warns Ayesha to break up with Riyaz. The two separate but Riyaz continues to sneak into Ayesha's house when her parents are away. Hansal, who lives in the building right across the Mahajans', sees Riyaz enter the house one night, and deliberately calls Sachin to inform him. In a drunk state, and unable to control his anger, Sachin attacks Riyaz with a surgical knife, injuring him on the arm. In a bid to save Riyaz, Ayesha hits her father on the head and he falls unconscious. Panicked, the two drag Sachin to his room and put him to bed. Riyaz leaves and Ayesha goes to sleep.  Paraskar is thus convinced that Sachin is not the killer. Brinda hires a prominent lawyer, who succeeds in getting Sachin out on bail. After the trial, Sachin tells Aarthi that he wants a divorce, and afterwards he books into a hotel with Brinda. Paraskar hunts down Riyaz, who has been hiding since the murder. During the interrogation, Paraskar and Riyaz are attacked and Riyaz is later found dead. Paraskar also discovers missing servant Chetan's dead body in the Mahajan house, adding to the mystery. Soon after, Chetan's relative Sudhakar Mishra is killed as well. Paraskar then interrogates Remy, and it is revealed that she had previously given birth, contrary to her earlier claims of never having been in a relationship. He meets her mother, who points out to a picture of a younger Remy, and the pieces finally fall in place, ending the investigation.  At the hotel, Sachin's dead body is found and the local police conclude that he committed suicide due to the guilt from the case. However, Paraskar is not convinced and summons Aarthi, Remy, Brinda, Hansal, Riyaz's parents and local police officers to the Mahajan house, where Ayesha was killed. He reveals that Ayesha was not the biological child of Aarti but was instead the daughter of Remy. Remy and Sachin had an affair when they were younger, but class differences did not allow Sachin to marry her, so he married Aarti instead. However, Aarthi is infertile so the couple decided to adopt a child. Sachin pretends to adopt a child, bringing home his daughter with Remy. He also hires Remy as a full time maid and nanny. As Ayesha begins to grow, Aarthi notices the striking similarity between her daughter and Remy, and realises the truth. As revenge, she plots to frame her husband when she gets the opportunity. Praskar reveals that Aarti had returned the night Aayesha died and not the next day as she had claimed. She was the one who killed Aayesha and later killed Chetan as well, since he had seen her walking out of Aayesha's room covered in blood. To complete her revenge, Aarthi then visits Sachin under the guise of serving him divorce papers, and kills him. Finally, Paraskar reveals that Riyaz and Sudhakar Mishra were killed by a corrupt local policeman, who was being bribed by Aarthi. As Aarthi is being arrested, she smirks at a distraught Remy, happy with the fact that she has killed her child and lover.

Rams (2015 film)
 Two sheep farming brothers haven't spoken to each other for forty years due to differences in their personalities, complicated by one brother's poor temper and alcoholism (it is implied his problems caused him to be disinherited, another source of strife between the two men), and the other brother's resentment and jealousy. They live in adjacent houses on the family farm, legally owned by the sober brother. Both are unmarried and attached to their flocks. A prize-winning ram belonging to the alcoholic brother is found to have [[scrapie]], causing all the sheep in the whole region - even though they show no symptoms - to be destroyed as a precaution so that the disease does not spread to the entire country. The farmers must also burn all their hay and disinfect the barns.  The sober brother, Gummi, kills his own flock before the biohazards team arrive, but he hides a few ewes and a ram in the basement of his house, as they are the last of their breed. His errant brother Kiddi blames Gummi for reporting the disease and the subsequent kill, enflaming tensions between them. Kiddi refuses to kill his own sheep, and after authorities intervene and exterminate them, he becomes more frequently drunk and abusive.  He also refuses to clean his barn, so as the legal owner, Gummi must step in and clean it - which he does while Kiddi is in the hospital. Upon his return, sobered-up Kiddi accidentally discovers Gummi's hidden flock of sheep and wants to help save them, but Gummi refuses all association. When a member of the cleanup team also discovers the hidden sheep, the two brothers are forced to collaborate and they attempt to drive them into the highlands in a blizzard. Their quad bike bogs down in a snowdrift, and the brothers become separated. The drove wander off, and Kiddi finds Gummi in a snowdrift, near death from hypothermia. He attempts to save his brother by building a makeshift snow shelter, but Gummi does not revive. The film ends with Kiddi attempting to warm Gummi in the womb-like shelter, acknowledging their reconciliation.

Sandhya, a self-proclaimed journalist, is in search of an anonymous writer who goes by the pen name "ANASHKU". She finds out about the writer from a publisher and sets on a journey to find him.  Pregnant Indu finds herself in trouble when she repetitively gets nightmares. She then convinces Gautam to visit her ancestral home in the village of Kamarottu in order to perform some rituals to solve her problems. Upon their arrival in Kamarottu, Gautam befriends the post master, Kalinga ([[Sai Kumar (Kannada actor)|Saikumar]]), and the elderly school head master, Shankar (Ananth Velu). During their stay in the village, Indu experiences strange occurrences in the house including an incident where Indu is almost pulled into a well while she is fetching a bucket of water. This provokes Gautam to investigate and he learns from Kalinga that the well contains a Brahmarakshasa (devil) and also that the Kamarottu home was haunted by a ghost (Guddada Bhoota).  Gautam's investigation also irks the powerful men in the village and on one occasion, one of the henchmen of a powerful politician attacks Goutham leaving him injured. Meanwhile, Sandhya's trail leads her to Kamarottu. Indu goes missing one night and later police declare that she was indeed killed 6 years ago in an accident. Confused Gowtham starts searching for her and discovers an illegal sand mafia led by the corrupt politician Mahabala Hegde along with the local police which leads him to conclude that their attack on him was merely to cover up their illegal activity.  Sandhya meets Gautham during the investigation of his wife's disappearance and helps him in discovering a diary titled "Harini" . Through this diary, Gautham discovers that the woman who he believed to be his wife Indu, was actually Harini, a yoga instructor from Bangalore, and that he himself is not Gautham. Indu and her husband Gautham were in reality Harini's friends. Harini, in an impulsive action fueled by fear, killed a man who got abusive and threatening after she spurned his physical advances. Horrified by the realization that she has killed and terrified by the prospect of legal repercussions, she confides in Indu and Gautham, who decide to take her to Kamarottu and create an alibi for Harini. A flashback reveals to the viewer that Gautham was actually Siddarth, an aspiring writer/singer who was in love with Sandhya.

Under a thick blanket of fog, Siddharth and his friend on a motorbike collide with the car carrying Indu, Gautham and Harini, near the Kamarottu junction.  The accident leaves Harini, and Siddharth, who's lost his memory, as the sole survivors of the accident. Harini, reluctant to go back to her previous life assumes the identity of her dead friend Indu, and informs authorities, and Siddharth, that he is her husband Gautham. Siddharth, with nothing else to go on, accepts this as the truth.  Siddarth and Sandhya infiltrate the police station and search the records where they get to know about a missing persons case where a lady goes missing on the same day (7 July) every year . When they check with their families they get to know that the missing lady is pregnant similar to Harini and that the guddada bhoota is responsible for the abductions. After getting info from the head master and the local doctor they conclude that Kalinga is the guddada bhoota and is responsible for the abductions.

She leaves without revealing her relationship with Siddharth, or his true identity, nursing a broken heart.  
Rajkahini
 In August 1947, the [[British Raj|British]] passed a bill regarding the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|partition of Bengal]]. Delving into the grim history of the Partition, [[Srijit Mukherji|Srijit]]'s movie ''Rajkahini'' is weaved around a [[Bangladesh–India border|border between the two nations]] that runs through a [[brothel]] housing eleven [[sex worker|women]].  [[Bengal]] was broken up twice ([[Partition of Bengal (1905)|1905]], and then during Independence) - officially for demographic reasons and ease of administration - but actually, it was a strictly political move to curtail Bengal politics. The narrative follows the erection of the [[Radcliffe Line]] as the [[Indo-Pakistani border|boundary]] between the newly formed nations of [[Dominion of India|India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] (present day Bangladesh). As both the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] and the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] battle it out in courtrooms as to which side of Bengal will get which territory, in another part of Bengal is a brothel, situated right in the middle of [[Debiganj Upazila|Debiganj]] and [[Haldibari, India|Haldibari]] districts, which is the home and the world to eleven women and two men. Begum Jaan ([[Rituparna Sengupta|Rituparna]]) is the boss, while the other women work under her as [[prostitutes]]. Begum's faithful bodyguard is Saleem Mirza (Nigel Akkara), a Pathan, and Sujan ([[Rudranil Ghosh]]) as their man-servant and entertainer. Begum Jaan is not concerned about [[Hindustan]] or Pakistan, her only concern is her business, which is running badly because of the partition and resulting riots. The local master and Congress worker ([[Abir Chatterjee]]) visits the brothel time to time with gifts for everyone.  Meanwhile, the political sky is darkening. The [[Radcliffe line]] passes between Debiganj and Haldibari, the former being placed in [[East Pakistan]], and the latter remaining in India. Mr. Prafulla Sen ([[Saswata Chatterjee]]) from Congress and Mr. Ilias (Kaushik Sen) from Muslim League (who were childhood friends but now separated) meet and discuss about the relocation of the people of the two districts. They discover that in its course, the boundary line has been drawn right through the middle of Begum Jaan's brothel. They meet Begum Jaan and tell her to evacuate her brothel along with her women, who refuses to budge. Meanwhile, the Nawab of Rangpur ([[Rajatava Dutta]]) was relocating with his family and followers to [[West Bengal]], where he stayed at the brothel for a night. Begum Jaan complained to him about Mr. Sen and Mr. Ilias, to get them out of their respective parties. After visiting [[Delhi]] for the meeting of the rulers of the [[Princely State]]s, he informed Begum that he is not an influential person anymore, and the Princely States were being integrated in the Indian Union, and the titles were being abolished. Begum decided to fight her own battle.  Exasperated at the futile attempts to evict Begum and her women from the house, Prafulla and Ilias turn to Kabir ([[Jisshu Sengupta]]), leader of a criminal gang, for help. Kabir and his gang commits all kinds of heinous crimes in these turbulent times of riots and violence. They chase Sujan and three other girls who were returning from the market. While Sujan manages to save the girls and help them escape, he himself gets butchered by Kabir. Sujan's death adds fuel to the fire in Begum's heart and they decide to have a final confrontation. Meanwhile, after being rejected by Begum Jaan, Master manages to trap a girl ([[Parno Mittra]]) into his schemes of getting back at Begum. He joins forces with Kabir and Prafulla. Ilias was dissatisfied with Kabir's ways but accepted the events as necessary for getting the job done.  That night, Kabir and his gang set fire to the brothel. The women, trained to use rifles by Saleem, put up a brave fight. Most of them get killed, however Saleem himself dies the most horrifying death. After the bloodbath, the remaining women including Begum enter the inferno of the house and willingly accept their death in their own "country", while being narrated the story of the legendary [[Rani Padmini]] of [[Rajputana]].  When dawn breaks, the house and its inmates have been burnt to dust. The film ends with Ilias, Prafulla, Master and lakhs of refugees from Debiganj and Haldibari coming together to see the remains of Begum Jaan's brothel, as ''[[Jana Gana Mana (hymn)|Bharata Bhagya Bidhata]]'' plays in the background.

Re-Kill
 A young girl returns home to find her parents missing and the house in disarray.  She sits down to watch television, and the news reveals that five years earlier, a zombie outbreak killed off 4.5 billion people worldwide, 10 million of which are from the [[United States]].  After detonating a nuclear bomb over [[San Francisco]] and walling off [[New York City]], the U.S. government declared the outbreak over and established a paramilitary force known as R-Division to hunt down and destroy the remaining zombies.  The girl watches a [[Reality television|reality TV]] series called ''Re-Kill'' that broadcasts live footage of R-Division squads.  Commercials interrupt the show, showing attempts to repopulate the United States and reassure the populace.  The show begins with a recap.  An [[Embedded journalism|embedded journalist]] accompanies a squad on a raid to [[New Orleans]], which has had reports of zombie activity.  The squad is overrun, and only two people make it to a car: Alex Winston and the journalist.  When the journalist stops speaking coherently and moans uncontrollably, Winston realizes she is infected and shoots her.  The government promises that the situation is under control and clears out the zombies.  Winston is reassigned to Division 6, which includes new recruit Tom Falkirk, former thief Omar Hernandez, immigrant Nguyen, Rose Matthews, "Grizzly" Adams, conspiracy theorist Trent Parker, and the squad leader, Sarge.  Along with embedded journalists Jimmy and Bobby, Division 8 is sent to investigate reports of a family who are harboring reanimated members.  Sarge explains that the outbreak spread so far because people could not give up hope their loved ones could be saved.  After neutralizing the human resistance, the soldiers rescue prisoners kept chained up for zombie food.  One of the family members reveals that his sister, a zombie, is kept in the attic.  Before she can be put down, she bites Tom, who is mercy-killed to prevent him from turning into a zombie.  In interviews, Parker is dismissive of Tom's sacrifice, and Sarge says that it is a known risk of the job.  Division 8's next job is to investigate a truck suspected of carrying contraband.  When they finally stop the truck, they find it contains zombies.  Sarge uses a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] to clear out the zombies.  The truckers initially profess ignorance of their cargo but eventually confirm rumors of the Judas Project, a shadowy program rumored to be an experiment on the zombies trapped in New York City.  Parker believes it to be a secret military project, but Sarge is more concerned with the possibility of a second outbreak, which he believes is inevitable due to human nature.  In the forbidden areas of New York City known as The Zone, they discover dead scientists and zombies who seem more intelligent.  After an ambush, Omar insists that Parker was bit and demands they kill him.  Before they kill him, Parker opens fire on the squad, killing Adams.  Winston is wounded next, and he sacrifices himself with a grenade to allow the others to escape.  In a previously recorded interview, he describes his belief that the government has secretly organized an ark for eligible survivors; he posthumously wishes the squad well and hopes they are accepted there.  Deeper in the Zone, Hernandez is bitten and turns.  As the squad faces a horde of zombies, including Hernandez, a man who claims to be the last remaining member of the Judas Project leads them to safety.  He explains the project was designed to turn the zombies against each other, but it instead revealed an alpha zombie, nicknamed Elvis, capable of leading a zombie army.  Jimmy says the network's drones will pick up and broadcast his and Bobby's footage every two hours.  As they perform reconnaissance, Bobby dies, alerting the zombie army.  The squad flees, only to be overwhelmed by zombies and killed one-by-one with the only survivor being Rose, who manages to kill Elvis.  As a special news report reveals zombie activity near the Zone and the start of a new outbreak, the young girl who was watching the program is revealed to have transformed into a zombie.  Elsewhere, it is shown that the ark is real and soldiers, including Rose, discuss having found groups of survivors.

They detain him but fail to find evidence against him. Detectives suspect a [[Satanism|satanic cult]] is involved because of Angela's testimony, in which Angela says that she was abused by people in masks and someone took pictures of it.  Bruce and Kenneth meet Angela's estranged brother Roy Gray ([[Devon Bostick]]) to inquire about why he left the house. Using the regression technique on him, he recalls hooded figures entering his room while he was young.

Meanwhile, Bruce begins having nightmares involving satanic rituals. Angela tells him that the cult is out to kill her as she has shown her demonic mark to him and that he is in danger as well.

Bruce starts to experience the same things and his nightmares increase in intensity.  Rose jumps from the window of her house after seeing ghostly figures, injuring herself. Bruce meets Angela in the church's cemetery to reassure her and after an emotional outburst, she kisses him. Shocked, Bruce leaves her there and returns to his home. He sees a soup advertisement on the street and recognizes the woman in it as the one he sees in his nightmares. He concludes that his imagination has run away with him. He tells Kenneth that all these past memories are induced by therapy and the whole situation is just the result of mass hysteria. Though the professor is initially resistant to the idea, he too comes to suspect that these memories were not real.  Bruce is attacked by two hooded figures who finally reveal themselves as George and their colleague, Farrell ([[Aaron Abrams]]). George was seeking revenge after Bruce detained him as a child molester and ruined his career. Bruce offers to forget the whole situation if George tells him everything he knows. After George reveals things, Bruce confronts Angela about her abuse and she insists she told the truth. Finally Bruce concludes that she was fabricating everything from the beginning as she wanted to escape from her family, whom she thinks are responsible for her mother's death. She wanted to elope with George, as they had a sexual relationship for some time, but he refused to elope with a minor. Angela accused her father in order to escape the house. When Bruce confronts her, she tells him that no one is going to believe him, especially if she tells them that they kissed in the cemetery. Bruce tells John everything but John decides to take the blame and pleads guilty in order to rescue Angela and hopes that she will forgive him one day for being a bad father.  The film ends with a statement that many cases like this were reported before the [[satanic abuse hysteria]] faded.

Regular Show: The Movie
  In the distant future, Rigby leads Benson, Skips, Hi-Five Ghost, Muscle Man, and Pops against a cyborg named Mr. Ross who is erasing time. They find Mr. Ross' weapon is guarded by a future version of Mordecai, who attempts to kill Rigby for a transgression he did in the past. Benson sacrifices himself so that Rigby can use a spaceship/time-machine to reach the past to stop the chaos. Rigby does so, but not before Mordecai shoots him with a plasma shotgun.  In the present, Mordecai and Rigby barely convince Benson not to fire them after running late due to Rigby's idea to get breakfast burritos. When the spaceship/time machine crash lands in the park, future Rigby tells Mordecai, Rigby and their co-workers that when Mordecai and Rigby were in high school, they created a time machine that backfired and created a "Time-nado", a tornado with the ability to travel through space and time, which was harnessed and weaponized by their former science teacher and volleyball coach, Mr. Ross, who was held responsible and sent to prison. Before dying, future Rigby also reveals future Mordecai shot him and says Rigby must "tell the truth" in order to save the universe, even if it costs him his friendship with Mordecai. When questioned for details, Mordecai explains they created the time machine because Rigby got into their dream college, College University, but Mordecai did not. Benson tries to convince everyone the whole thing is a hoax until Muscle Man finds future Mordecai's plasma shotgun and accidentally blows up Benson's car with it, leaving Benson in shock.  After preparing for the mission, the employees use the ship to reach Mordecai and Rigby's high school days but damage the ship's engines in the process. Skips, Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost stay behind to repair the ship's engines while Benson and Pops follow Mordecai and Rigby to the science lab to find the time machine that past Mordecai and past Rigby was working on with past Mr. Ross, who is angry at Rigby for costing the volleyball team the championship but was forced to let him do an extra credit assignment to pass his class. However, the volleyball team attack them and make them separate, forcing Mordecai and Rigby to get help from their past selves.  After convincing past Rigby to make a model volcano instead, the group destroy the time machine and return to the spaceship/time machine only to find the repairs stalled due to an encounter with Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost's past selves. Complicating matters further is that temporal ruptures begin appearing just as the repairs are finished. Rigby, who had slipped away earlier, alerts them that past Mordecai and past Rigby are heading to the high school to finish a second time machine future Mr. Ross planted. The employees race back to the science lab but are held up by Mr. Ross and future Mordecai, allowing past Mordecai and past Rigby to botch the time machine and create the Time-nado. Mr. Ross then forces Rigby to admit the truth while holding Mordecai hostage: he never got into College U but Mordecai did and he created Mordecai's fake rejection letter in order to maintain their friendship. Mr. Ross tries to kill Mordecai with a volleyball bomb in the confusion, but future Mordecai jumps into the bomb's path, taking a heavy wound and forcing Mr. Ross to retreat.  Enraged over the duplicity, Mordecai ends his friendship with Rigby completely, blaming him for holding him back. This prompts a heartbroken Rigby to run off with the spaceship/time machine, leaving the group behind. Before dying, future Mordecai gives his present version his timeship and instructs him to patch things up, saying what Rigby did was no excuse to side with Mr. Ross. As the group tries to rebound, a distress call from future Gene the Vending Machine prompts them to help out. Meanwhile, after a failed suicide attempt to fly into the sun, Rigby encounters Father Time, who is falling apart due to the Time-nado and convinces Rigby to apologize to Mordecai. Rigby heads to the future and races back to the Time-nado space station but gets intercepted along with Mordecai by Mr. Ross at the temporal crystal power core. With Techmo's help, the duo manages to decapitate Mr. Ross and, after they restore their friendship, they use the plutonium in Mordecai's ship to destroy the Time-nado. They later convince past Rigby to apologize to past Mr. Ross before he's arrested by Mr. Dean, thus ending the issues between them and altering the future.  In the present, Mordecai and Rigby agree that, despite how cool their future selves turned out, they won't let their friendship degrade into trying to kill each other, thus erasing their future selves from the timeline. The next day, as Benson catches them out of the park, the pair race back in the spaceship/time machine at a fast food place with Rigby saying they'll "never be late again".

The Ridiculous 6
  In the [[American frontier|Old West]] era, a calm man named Tommy, known as "White Knife" by the Native American tribe who raised him after his mother was murdered, is to marry a member of the tribe named Smoking Fox. Following a run-in with a deranged, Native American-racist food proprietor named Clem and the Left-Eye Gang, bandits led by under Will Patch who claimed to have removed their right eyes as proof of membership, Tommy and his troop are visited by a bank robber named Frank Stockburn who claims to be Tommy's biological father. Tommy explains to Frank that his mother was shot by a man with a tattooed hand when she was escorting him to school during his childhood, something that has haunted his dreams since. Frank also tells Tommy that he is dying of [[Tuberculosis|consumption]] and had amassed $50,000 which he buried in a meadow next to a pine tree and is offering to Tommy and the Natives. The next day, a group of bandits with connections to Frank come to the village, led by the ruthless Cicero who wants Frank to give them his "big score" he gained a while back. Frank has the bandits kidnap him so he can lead them to the $50,000 at the so-called "Singing Windmill", in return for the bandits not attacking Tommy or the Indians. With no time to search the meadow and find the money, and to live to his tribe's standards, Tommy decides to resort to stealing from dishonorable persons (corrupt politicians, racist bankers, and thugs alike) to obtain the amount needed and save his father. During his quest, Tommy discovers that he has 5 half-brothers: [[Mexicans|Mexican]] burro rider Ramon whose innkeeper mother had a fling with Frank; mentally challenged yet happy-go-lucky Lil' Pete (Lautner) whose strong neck makes him immune to hanging; feral mountain-man Herm (Garcia) who speaks incomprehensibly while having helped his mother sell their moonshine.  Tommy meets his last two half-brothers, [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s former bodyguard Danny who resorts to drinking from guilt of accidentally leading [[John Wilkes Booth]] to [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|murder him]]; and African-American saloon pianist Chico who confesses to be half-White, when the brothers stole a large gold nugget from Chico's boss: the ever smiling sociopathic saloon owner Smiley Harris, who was part of Frank's gang until Frank stole his cut of their biggest score and left him to die at the windmill. When Smiley attempts to kill the brothers as revenge against Frank, he ended up being unintentionally decapitated by Ramon who was trying to knock him out. Meanwhile, having joined the Left-Eye Gang at the cost of his only functional eye, Clem helps the bandits abduct Smoking Fox while searching for Tommy before their captive ultimately eluded them while they learn of the brothers' exploits as they came to be known as the Ridiculous 6. The Left-Eye Gang soon catch up to the Ridiculous 6 while they were relaxing in a pond, overpowered but stealing their loot. But at Herm's notion, which Tommy translates through his mysticism, the brothers decide to rob from gambling game in Yuma hosted by Ezekiel Grant and attended by Mark Twain and General George Armstrong Custer. Through Wyatt Earp nearly jeopardized their plan, the brothers succeed and head out to ransom their father, saving the Eye Patch Gang after learning they were left to die by Cicero while forcing them to reform and getting back the original $50,000.  As dusk falls, Tommy realizes through a Danny's photograph of their father that Cicero is his mother's murderer, leaving his brothers in the cover of night to rescue his father and kill Cicero. The half-brothers, who followed Tommy along with the Left-Eye Gang, have a reunion with their long lost father, who reveals to have masterminded his abduction upon learning his sons exceed his expectations in amassing $100,000 and had taken Smoking Fox captive when she found him after eluding the Left-Eye Gang. But Tommy reveals his group had a Plan B: a hidden bomb inside the bag containing the ransom money. When the bomb explodes and commotion ensues, Frank runs off with Smoking Fox inside a mine. Tommy runs after them and successfully rescues his bride-to-be and captures his father. Also, in the process of the fighting, the Left-Eye Gang accidentally reveal that they lied about removing their right eyes, much to Clem's outrage. Back in the Native Village, Tommy weds Smoking Fox with his brothers in attendance. Since the revelation that their biological father Frank Stockburn was no more than a two-bit crook, the Native chief decides to adopt the half-brothers as he did with Tommy.

The Rezort
 After humanity wins a war against zombies, tourists are able to kill zombies for sport at the Rezort.  Guests include couple Lewis and Melanie, who want to conquer Melanie's psychological issues caused by the zombie war; Archer, a quiet veteran; Jack and Alfie, teenage video gamers; and Sadie, whose ex-fiancé dumped her prior to their wedding.  After the group meets the owner of the resort, Valerie Wilton, Archer sees Sadie sneak into a control room.  There, she hacks into a mainframe, causing the system to become erratic.  The engineers, scared they could lose their jobs due to careless system security, keep quiet about the problems as they attempt to fix the system.  After meeting their guide, Nevins, the guests leave the resort to hunt zombies.  The first group of zombies are restrained in place and easily killed.  The second group roam freely, and the guests snipe at them from a safe distance.  Despite Lewis' urging, Melanie can not bring herself to shoot one.  Archer surprises the others by scoring many rapid head shots, later explaining that he has come to the resort because killing zombies is the only thing he was ever good at.  Nevins leads them to a safe spot, and they camp for the night.  When they can not sleep, Melanie and Sadie discuss the ethics of killing zombies for sport, and Sadie says she believes it leads to a decreased inhibition to harm the living.  After several system failures, the resort's security system goes offline.  Zombies are released from their fenced-in pens, killing the guests and staff in the resort.  Wilton escapes to her office, sealing the door behind her and dooming the remaining engineers.  The guests outside the resort in the safari do not realize what has happened until the now-freed zombies attack them.  Alfie is killed in the melee.  Nevins tells them the entire island will be firebombed in several hours as a failsafe, and their only hope is to escape to the docks.  Nevins' SUV fails to start, and Archer leads them on foot toward the docks.  As they pass through a security checkpoint, Nevins is bitten.  Lewis angers Melanie when he kills Nevins with a head shot.  When the guests are on their way to the docks, Archer threatens to leave Sadie behind unless she reveals her involvement in the resort's problems.  She admits to being a member of a zombie rights activist group and says she merely copied documents from the resort's mainframe to prove the resort's danger.  Jack says she has been used to inject a virus in the system and cause the destruction of the resort.  Although angry at her actions, Melanie promises Sadie  she will not be left behind.  After zombies attack, the guests get caught in tunnels and suddenly Archer, Melanie, and Lewis go one way, and Jack and Sadie another.  Sadie is bitten and sacrifices herself to give Jack time to escape.  Before she dies, she gives him her evidence.  Jack rejoins the others, and they enter the resort.  After wandering through a security area, they discover the resort has been using a charitable front organization to lure refugees to the island, where they are transformed into zombies. Jack is bitten, and Archer kills him.  As Archer and Melanie hold back zombies, Lewis abandons them.  Archer tells Melanie to flee to the docks and apparently sacrifices himself.  Near the control room, Melanie encounters Lewis, who has subsequently been bitten. Instead of killing him, she hands him her pistol which he uses to shoot himself in the head.  Melanie is attacked, but Wilton rescues her. Melanie accuses her of being worse than the zombies, some of whom break in and ignore Melanie in their zeal to kill Wilton. Melanie barely escapes the resort in time to avoid the firebombing. After being rescued, she reveals the extent of the resort's crimes; Archer – revealed to have also escaped – watches her on television. Melanie says that in winning the war, people lost their humanity. After Melanie warns of a new zombie war, the news program cuts to a live feed in which zombies are revealed to be attacking people on a beach, concluding that the zombies traveled through the oceans.

Cheon-soo tells Heejung he appreciates her as a woman and the two flirt. Cheon-soo tells Heejung he likes her as a friend and then as more than a friend. He drunkenly digs through his pockets searching for a ring he can give her but Heejung becomes morose telling him that she doesn't have any friends. Cheon-soo goes out for a smoke and Heejung remembers that she has a small gathering to go to for her friend's birthday. She asks Cheon-soo to accompany her and he does.   The evening goes sour however when Heejung tells her friends how touched she was by the things that Cheon-soo told her about her painting in the gallery and her friend reveals that he has said many similar things in interviews. She also brings up his reputation as a womanizer and the fact that he is married, which he confirms. Heejung goes to lie down to sleep off being drunk. When Cheon-soo tries to approach her again she tells him to leave. Going home her mother berates her for being drunk.  At the screening the following day Cheon-soo is hung-over and acts angry and erratic at the post-film discussion. A friend of Heejung's arrives and gives him a book of her own writing. Cheon-soo leaves to go back to Seoul.   ===Part 2=== The day begins over again. Cheon-soo again goes to the temple where he sees Heejung and introduces himself. At the coffee shop he asks her about her life and she tells him she lives with her mother and never sees her father since he divorced her mother and moved to [[Seoul]].  Cheo-soo goes to Heejung's atelier where he tells her that she paints with confidence but it seems like the painting was made for her alone. He tells her she needs to be bolder with her choices but that the quality of the painting is there. Heejung is outraged that he was so insulting about her painting. To escape her anger Cheo-soo goes out for a smoke. Heejung leads him to the rooftop where she points to where her home is.  At the sushi restaurant Cheo-soo goes for a smoke earlier and then comes back. He tells Cheo-soo she is beautiful and she asks if he is a womanizer. She then asks him why he said that she seemed sad from her painting and he tells her that she projects that aura. She confides in him that she has no friends and he tells her that it's alright, that's probably just the way she is. Cheo-soo then tells her he loves her and wants to marry her but can't as he's married with two children. He begins to cry. Heejung tells him she feels sad and wishes they met at an earlier time. Cheo-soo gives her a ring that he found on the street and Heejung calls it their wedding ring. Heejung again invites him to meet her friends.   At the gathering her friends are more receptive and find Cheo-soo kind and unlike his reputation. Encouraged to drink by Heejung's friends he briefly passes out and plays it off as a bit of play-acting. He then begins taking off his clothes, much to their alarm.   Cheo-soo goes to wake up Heejung and tells her he wants to leave. Though she is initially reluctant to do so for fear of what it will look like she eventually decides to go. Walking home she receives a call from her mother who asks her where she is and tells her that Cheo-soo stripped in front of her friends which she finds hilarious.   Cheo-soo walks her home but asks her to come back out so they can continue talking. Heejung promises to do so and gives him a kiss on the cheek before her mother comes out and she goes inside.

An eccentric man, Grizard, stops and offers the two a ride.  Although Véronique is reluctant, Jack convinces her to accept Grizard's offer.  When Grizard discovers that Jack is English, he enthusiastically invites Jack to meet his English wife.  Véronique protests at the detour, but Jack again convinces her to accept Grizard's hospitality.  On the way to his house, Grizard stops to pick up roadkill and laughs when Jack suggests they bury it instead of eating it.  Mary, Grizard's wife, turns out to be American, though she says she has also lived in England.  During dinner, Jack reveals that he is a vegetarian and apologetically declines to eat their meat.

That night, Véronique enters his bedroom, and they have sex.  Jack invites her to come to England with him, and she excitedly accepts.  When he wakes, she is nowhere to be found.

As he leaves, Jack realises the handwriting on the note is not Véronique's.  Before he can do anything else, he is drugged and kidnapped by Grizard's handyman, Delacroix.  Delacroix says Jack must have annoyed Grizard a great deal, and, in French, variously threatens and mocks Jack; Jack says he does not understand and begs to be let go.  Delacroix ties up Jack and puts him in his truck, but, before Delaxcroix can drive off, Jack escapes.  Delacroix says to himself that Jack is in even worse trouble now that he has escaped.  Jack returns to Grizard's house, where he finds Véronique tied up.  After freeing her, he arms himself with a rifle.  Jack and Véronique escape the house in a stolen car, pursued by Grizard and Mary, who have returned home.  After a car chase in which their car flips, Jack and Véronique flee on foot.  They encounter Delacroix, who, after a scuffle, accidentally impales himself on a farm tool.  While Jack is not looking, Véronique kills Delacroix with a knife.  Grizard finds her and has a flashback to when Véronique was a child.  She claims then, as she does now, that she did not murder anyone and the death was accidental.  In French, Mary and Grizard, revealed to be Véronique's parents, plead with her to return home and stop killing people, saying they cannot cover for her any more.  Véronique refuses.  Before Mary can tell Jack the truth in English, Véronique knocks Mary unconscious with the rifle and gags Grizard.

Anand's older brother becomes mentally unstable and, at Sambasiva Rao's advice, the father of Anand's fiancée Pallavi cancels their upcoming wedding. Anand and his family move to a simpler home in Hyderabad, and he becomes the family's sole breadwinner. He joins his friend's event-management company as a wedding planner, and his assistant Parandhamaiah goes with him.  Anand is assigned to plan a destination wedding at [[Ooty]], which turns out to be Pallavi's. There he meets Sameera (also known as Subbalakshmi), a diabetic, with whom he eventually falls in love. While planning Pallavi's marriage Anand faces many difficulties, including an attempt by Pallavi's uncle and his son to stop the marriage because of her father's mistreatment. Pallavi's father and uncle reconcile, and Anand is paid more than the agreed amount in gratitude. Sameera turns out to be Sambasiva Rao's daughter; the latter objects to their marriage, saying that Satyamurthy cheated him when he sold an  property illegally acquired by landlord Devaraj Naidu. The current market value of the land is half&nbsp;billion rupees. Sambasiva Rao tells Anand that he will agree to the marriage if Anand can deliver the land documents from Devaraj in four weeks.  Anand and Parandhamaiah set out for house number 6 in Reddiarpatti to exchange the original documents for fake ones. Instead they end up in house number 9 and reveal their intentions to Devaraj, who traps them without harm; Devaraj cannot hurt anyone in front of his wife, Lakshmi, from whom he has hidden his true self for twenty years. Sambasiva Rao's family is kidnapped and brought to Devaraj's house; the next day Anand saves Devaraj from the brother (Kumarasamy Naidu, Devaraj's henchman since five years) of his rival, Veerasamy Naidu. Impressed, Devaraj agrees to return the land documents if Anand becomes engaged to his sister Valli. However, Valli wants to marry Lakshmi's brother and threatens to kill Anand if he does not break their engagement.  Valli teases Sameera, acting as if she is in love with Anand (which makes Devaraj happy). Devaraj's brother-in-law Koda Rambabu goes to Reddiarpatti, mistakenly believing that Parandhamaiah is Sameera's lover and Valli's potential lover. He wants to stop the marriage, and at Anand's suggestion Rambabu and Sambasiva Rao ask Veerasamy to have his henchmen kill the bridegroom; this would stop the marriage on the last day of the four-week deadline imposed by Sambasiva Rao. Although Anand plans to help Valli elope with her cousin, Veerasamy's henchmen mistake him for Anand and try to kill him. Devaraj and Anand save her cousin; when Devaraj tries to kill Rambabu, Anand says that he was the mastermind behind the plan and wants the real land documents.  Nine minutes are left before Sambasiva Rao's deadline; as Anand and Devaraj duel, Anand's mother enters. Devaraj and his family are shocked, remembering that Satyamurthy was fatally injured when he saved Valli from an accident planned by Veerasamy. Before he died, Satyamurthy told Valli that he made a mistake selling illegally acquired land to his friend and wants to rectify it with the landlord. Devaraj and Sambasiva Rao are full of remorse, and Devaraj returns the land documents to Anand in accordance with Satyamurthy's last wish. Anand gives the papers to Sambasiva Rao, who apologises for his behaviour. Veerasamy dies in an accident, and Koda Rambabu is spared.  Anand and Sambasiva Rao are on their way home with their families when Pallavi's father meets them with news that the market value of Anand's stock is now worth five&nbsp;billion rupees. An emotional Anand thanks his father at the spot where Satyamurthy saved Valli's life.

Then, one day on his way to work, Charles bumps into Skid, Vickie's psychotic pimp, who starts having a conversation with Charles about his disdain towards women, rooted in the fact that he had a bad mother.  At the fourth lighthouse Vickie expresses to Charles how much she appreciates him and that she'll miss going to lighthouses with him.  Vickie and Charles stop by Vickie's family house for another visit. While looking through old photos of one another, Kate tells Vickie that she is nothing but a whore at which Vickie walks out of the house. Still outside her family's home, and crying, Vickie becomes angry with Charles for persuading her to see her family again and telling him that the only reason she hung out with him was because she felt sorry for him. Days go by, and Vickie stops talking to Charles and stays away from the truck stop.  Meanwhile, Charles finally hands in his collection of photos for the contest to which he titles, “Beacon of Light.”  On his way home from school Charles runs into neighborhood bullies, who push him down and break his camera.  While at work, Skid, who is showing symptoms of paranoia, asks Charles if he has seen Vickie lately, Charles tells Skid that he hasn't seen Vickie in a while, Skid leaves.  Back at home, Charles and his dying father are sitting outside their home, during which time Charles' father tells him how much he loves him and that he is proud of the man he has become. Charles' father passes away a few moments later.  After the funeral, Peg, seeing how Charles was under duress about his father passing away, tells him that she'll always be there for him. Charles ends up placing third in the photography contest. Skid eventually ends up tracking down Vickie and waits for her in her motel room until she arrives. Once Vickie arrives, she asks Skid to leave and tells him that she never stole from him. Skid then throws a stack of money, that Vickie was trying to hide from him, in her face. Skid punches Vickie and pins her down onto the bed.  Charles arrives suddenly and tells Skid to stop hurting Vickie. Skid and Charles get into a physical altercation, at which point Vickie grabs her gun and shoots Skid.

Meanwhile, [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] [[Seismology|seismologist]] Dr. Lawrence Hayes and his colleague Dr. Kim Park are at [[Hoover Dam]] doing research for a new earthquake predicting model when a nearby and previously unknown [[fault (geology)|fault]] ruptures. This triggers a [[Seismic magnitude scales|7.1 magnitude]] earthquake that collapses the dam and kills Park after he rescues a little girl and throws her to Hayes as he falls to the collapsing ground. When Ray is called into work because of this, Blake goes with her mother's new boyfriend Daniel Riddick to San Francisco, instead of Ray.  Hayes discovers that the entire [[San Andreas Fault]] is shifting and will soon cause a major earthquake, thereby destroying cities along the fault line.   In San Francisco, Daniel brings Blake to his office where she meets Ben, an engineer from England seeking employment and his brother, Ollie. Daniel and Blake leave the premises, but they become trapped in their car in the parking garage after a string of earthquakes, with Blake getting her legs pinned in the event. Daniel leaves the car and abandons Blake. Soon after, she is found by Ben and Ollie, who help her escape. They then find a working phone in [[Chinatown (San Francisco)|Chinatown]] and Blake calls Ray and Emma, who fly to San Francisco to save her.  En route, Ray's helicopter fails, forcing him to make an emergency landing at a [[shopping mall]] in [[Bakersfield]]. Amid the chaos of looting, he steals a [[Ford F-150]] and he and Emma escape. They come across an older couple broken down on the side of the road where the San Andreas Fault has opened up, blocking the road and the couple, who happen to own an airplane, agree to give it up in exchange for Ray's truck.  In San Francisco, Blake, Ben and Ollie are following a path to [[Nob Hill, San Francisco|Nob Hill]] in an attempt to signal Ray, as the point they agreed to meet at, [[Coit Tower]], is engulfed in flames.

Much of the city is left in ruins and Blake, Ben and Ollie narrowly survive. Ray and Emma, realizing they cannot make their way through the destroyed city, are able to commandeer a boat only to see that the water in the bay is beginning to recede, indicating that a [[tsunami]] is approaching.  As it approaches, Blake, Ben, and Ollie run into a building under construction which Daniel helped design. Ray and Emma, accompanied by dozens of other people in boats, manage to make it over the wave before it crests, barely avoiding a huge cargo ship getting caught up in the wave. They then watch in horror as the giant tsunami hits the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] with the enormous cargo ship, which snaps the center span cleanly in two; Daniel is among those killed when a loose shipping container crushes him. The wave then proceeds into the ruined city, swamping [[cruise ship]]s, killing thousands and flooding the building Blake is in. Emma and Ray make their way through the flooded downtown area and are finally able to locate Blake, Ben, and Ollie as the building begins to sink beneath the water. Ray dives into the building to save Blake as she becomes unconscious while trapped underwater, while Emma breaks into the building with the boat and rescues everyone just as the building also collapses; however, it appears too late as Blake has seemingly drowned. Ray, however, manages to resuscitate her, and the family is happily reunited.

The Sand
 A group of friends are having a party at the beach with some of their classmates. A girl named Heather (Etalvia Cashin) is videoing the party, when two of the boys, Vance (Hector David Jr.) and Gilbert (Cleo Berry), find a large ball covered in a strange gooey substance. All the teenagers agree to put their mobile phones in the trunk of a car in an effort to ensure that no one will post compromising pictures or videos online.  The next morning two of the friends, Kaylee (Brooke Butler) and Mitch ([[Mitchel Musso]]) wake up on the lifeguard shack. Kaylee's boyfriend, Jonah ([[Dean Geyer]]), awakens in a nearby convertible next to a girl named Chanda ([[Meagan Holder]]). In the back seat are Vance and his girlfriend, Ronnie (Cynthia Murell). Gilbert wakes up, stuck from the waist down in a trash barrel, having been put there as a prank after passing out. A girl named Marsha ([[Nikki Leigh]]) wakes up, topless, having fallen asleep on top of a picnic table. The rest of the teenagers, including Heather, are nowhere to be found; there are, instead, a bunch of empty sleeping bags in their places.  Marsha accuses Heather of having stolen her top; she leaves the picnic table to find her. Kaylee, having witnessed a bird getting sucked into the sand tries to warn her, but Marsha doesn't listen. She is immediately immobilized in the sand and is visibly discombobulated when she gets trapped. Vance attempts to help her but he, too, becomes trapped when he touches the sand. Vance and Marsha are swallowed by the creature, as their bodies sink into the sand, much to the horror of their friends. Jonah sees the cracked ball from the night before and concludes that it must have been an egg, and whatever hatched from it has burrowed under the sand and has wiped out everyone, including Vance, Heather, and Marsha.  The group cannot call for help, as their phones are locked in the trunk of the car, and the car's battery is dead from their having left the headlights on all night. Mitch and Kaylee find hot dogs in the lifeguard shack and toss them at different ends of the beach to find out the extent of the creature under the sand. Thus they find the edge of it, and the group is momentarily hopeful until they realize the distance is too great. Jonah uses two surfboards as a bridge to reach the picnic table. He makes it to the table, but not before the creature has slashed his stomach, leaving a painful wound that starts to seep pus. He notes to the others, though, that the creature won't go near the ashes of the previous night's bonfire, indicating that it hates fire.  The sun beats down. Ronnie and Chanda attempt to retrieve the phones from the trunk of the car, but Ronnie becomes trapped, her fingers crushed under the rim of the trunk. A beach patrolman ([[Jamie Kennedy]]) drives onto the beach. The group warns him, then are shocked to see him get out of his car and walk across the sand unmolested. Mitch realizes that the man's boots are protecting him. The patrolman, seeing Jonah's and Ronnie's injuries and Gilbert stuck in the trash barrel, assumes the group is on drugs and taunts them.  But the patrolman drops his keys in the sand, and when he reaches to pick them up, his hand is captured. He uses his pepper spray, which temporarily saves him, but in the process, his lower arm has been consumed; the shock causes him to fall, and he is sucked into the sand. Kaylee, however, manages to retrieve his pepper spray. The pepper spray gives Mitch an idea: he thinks he can get to the truck by putting his flip-flops on and wrapping his feet with towels soaked in pepper spray. Chanda throws him a towel from the car, but when Mitch attempts to catch it the banister breaks and he falls to the sand and is devoured by the sand creature in a gruesome fashion.   Kaylee, after a brief moment of sadness, takes charge. She frees Ronnie's fingers from the car trunk, then has Chanda take the broken pieces of the boardwalk and use them as a bridge to get to Jonah on the picnic table. Meanwhile, Gilbert discovers that he has cut his stomach on the edge of the trash barrel during his attempts to escape, thus alerting the creature.  Kaylee and Ronnie each make their way across the makeshift bridge to Chanda and Jonah. At the last step, Ronnie trips and, despite Kaylee's efforts with the pepper spray, she dies and sucked into the sand by the creature. Chanda, in desperation, follows through with Mitch's plan and runs across the sand to the truck with pepper-sprayed towels wrapping her feet. The group celebrates for a brief moment as she succeeds. But just then, Gilbert is attacked by the creature, sucked down through the bottom of the barrel. The creature, having grown much larger tentacles, bangs against the patrol car, knocking Chanda unconscious.  At nightfall, Chanda wakes up and recuperates. She gets to the back of the truck and finds a self-inflatable raft. Chanda inflates the raft, and Kaylee and Jonah use it to reach the patrolman's car. However, the ground erupts, knocking Kaylee out of the open door and onto the raft. A huge glowing tentacle shoots out from the ground and assaults her. She manages to get on top of the car and, finding two gas cans on the rear rack, uses them to set one of the large tentacles on fire.  Kaylee, Chanda, and Jonah lock themselves in the car as the creature's tentacles flail and bash at them. Eventually, the attacks stop; in the silence, Kaylee and Chanda see that Jonah has died from his injuries. The two girls cry for the loss of their friends and fall asleep huddled together.  In the morning, the girls are awakened by a man (Michael Huntsman), who taps on the glass and asks them if they are alright. Kaylee and Chanda note, incredulously, that the creature is gone. They walk across the sand together, traumatized, as the man calls for an ambulance.   In a closing shot, the creature, revealed as an enormous jellyfish, is seen under the water, faraway and headed towards another beach full of people.

Santa places Eleanor on the naughty list for her poor sportsmanship during the competition, thus disqualifying her from the position, and reveals it was Billie he was testing for the position of Santa’s Little Helper all along.

He tried to escape the dense sea of trees but cannot find the trail back. Arthur decides to help him but also ends up disoriented in the forest. They survive falls, flash floods and hypothermia as they try to escape the forest and along the way find others who succeeded in ending their lives. They share their stories together and it's revealed that Arthur is there because of his guilt of how he and his wife treated each other in their marriage.  After she becomes sick they rekindle their love and reminisce about a favorite place of hers where she would spend hours amongst the orchids. He says he will take her back there when she's ready to. The doctor tells them she will survive and she is transported by ambulance to a recovery hospital. He follows behind her in his car, talking to her on the phone and jokes with her about not knowing what her favorite color or season is. Before she responds a  truck plows into the ambulance killing her. At her funeral he tells the director he didn't really know her even after all the years they were married. He says he overheard her sisters talking and one of them sent her a copy of her favorite book. This is the package Arthur brings with him into the forest.  After a night of talking Arthur separates from Takumi in the morning to try to get help. He found a walkie-talkie from a deceased camper and Takumi is too unwell.

He finds the package he left in the forest and also the tent and the coat he covered over Takumi but there is no Takumi. He takes away the coat and under it is a beautiful orchid. He remembers what Takumi said about the forest. He believed it is a form of purgatory and that the spirit of your loved ones go there and are closest during your darkest moments. He opens the package holding her favorite book and it is a copy of Hansel and Gretel. Arthur realizes it was Joan's spirit that helped him find his way out and is helping him heal his guilt to go on without her.  Arthur returns to America and brings the orchid with him. While helping a student it's revealed that the names of Takumi's wife and daughter are not names but words that mean yellow and winter.

[[Velma Dinkley|Velma]] tells her she can do it, yet despite the encouragements, Daphne crashes the van into a tree. Later she and Velma win a lottery that takes people into space. The two girls soon find themselves going into space along with billionaire Sly Baron, trained astronaut Shannon Lucas, retired astronauts Zip Elvin and Colt Steelcase, alien hunting specialist Ridley, football player Uvininous "U-boat" Botango, news reporter Clark Sparkman (who instantly takes a fancy to Velma, much to her annoyance) and of course [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred]], [[Shaggy Rogers|Shaggy]] and [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]]. Fred allies himself with Zip and Colt, much to their dismay. Shaggy and Scooby are happy to see U-boat. Shannon tells Daphne that she scored the highest on the space test she and her friends took, much to Velma's surprise. This causes Velma to become bitter towards Daphne.  Soon everyone is boarding Sly's ship, The Sly Star One and they blast off into space. Once in space, they meet a robot named H.A.M. whose sense of humor is horrible and dark. After a while, a mysterious [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] starts messing with the ship, causing it to land on Sly's space resort, situated on the [[Far side of the Moon|dark side of the moon]]. There they are greeted by Sly's twin brother Hudson and some Sly Bots. Afterwards Scooby and Shaggy go to find some food while their friends go to find the alien. Velma's bitterness towards Daphne increases, causing a rift in their friendship. Fred continues to annoy Zip and Colt.

After a while Fred decides to trap the alien. During the plan to trap the alien, Daphne and Velma still continue to argue and Velma finally says that she wonders what if Daphne is the astronaut.  Afterwards, the gang later catches the alien and it is revealed to be Shannon who states that she wanted to convince people on Earth that space travel isn't safe for amateurs and should be left to professionals. She used her alien costume to make that happen and most of the other characters Scooby and his friends had met during the course of the movie to unknowingly go along in her plan. She then realized that with Scooby and his friends abroad, they would prove the alien hoax and foil her scheme and had to make it hard for them to work together. So she reveals that she lied about Daphne getting the highest score, knowing it would put a strain on her and Velma's friendship, and reveals that it was actually Shaggy who got the highest score (much to everyone's--including Velma and Shaggy's--surprise). She traps the heroes behind a wall of glass, telling them she planted explosive devices all over the resort to blow it up. She heads back to the now repaired Sly Star One and get back to earth alone, leaving the others to their deaths.  Ham reveals that he isn't really a robot but a flesh and blood human actor. The gang quickly manage to escape the glass wall and rush into an exact copy of the Sly Star One, built by Hudson. However the tank is broken. Luckily Zip and Colt go to hold it down and they allow Fred to help them, finally accepting him. When the others wonder who will fly the ship, everyone is knocked by pieces of falling metal. Velma tells Daphne she has to fly them home. At first, Daphne protests, but Velma assures her she believes she can do it because she is her best friend.  Upon hearing Velma's kind words of encouragement, Daphne manages to get the ship off the ground and fly everyone home. Once home, the heroes confront Shannon and expose her scheme. She is taken to prison. Once Shannon is taken away, Daphne and Velma reconcile. The movie ends with Daphne once again driving the Mystery Machine with all her friends.  
The Scorpion King 4: Quest for Power
 Mathayus and his partner Drazen (who is under the Akkadian's tutelage) infiltrate the palace of Skizzura to find and acquire an artifact known as the Urn of Kings for King Zakkour of Al-Moraad. In the process, they are discovered and a short fight ensues, revealing Drazen to be a traitor who was really after the Urn.  Mathayus returns to Zakkour, who tells him that the Urn's inscription will show the way to use the powers of Lord Alcaman, a powerful sorcerer who once controlled the entire known world. Under the instructions of the King, Mathayus follows Drazen to the kingdom of Norvania in the Northern Forests to deliver a peace treaty. Drazen gives the Urn to his father King Yannick who shatters it to retrieve the Golden Key of Lord Alcaman, which has the true inscription written on it.  Mathayus arrives in Norvania and is accosted by the king's guards. The soldiers are unable to best Mathayus, who allows himself to be arrested so he can enter the King's castle. In jail, Mathayus meets another inmate, Valina Raskov, who convinces Mathayus to pay her to meet the king. She explains that she is a member of the original royal bloodline and Drazen wishes to cement his father's rise to power with her public execution. Drazen appears with guards and takes Mathayus to be tortured, suspecting his peace treaty is a pretense. However, King Yannick believes Mathayus, releases him, and invites him to a dinner banquet. Drazen assassinates his father with black [[scorpion]]s to cast blame on Mathayus and stall the treaty. Before dying, Yannick gives the Key to Mathayus, who resists capture and flees with Valina, who has feigned an illness to escape her cell, uses the ensuing chaos to leave the castle.  In the process, Mathayus suffers an arrow wound to the shoulder (as he did when fighting King Memnon), forcing the pair to go to Valina's father, Sorrell Raskov, an eccentric scholar and inventor who is unwilling to retake his place as ruler. Sorrell is shown the Key and explains how it will allegedly unlock Alcaman's palace, where a worthy man can take the Lord's crown and rule the world. Drazen arrives and forces them to give up the key, leaving them to die as he burns the house.  The heroes escape and follow Drazen to Glenrrossovia, a village in Sorrell's notes on the Key's code. Drazen begins terrorizing the villagers to find the palace. After enlisting a local boy to steal the key, they take it to the Temple of the Goddess, presided over by High Priestess Feminina. They discover the Key inserts into a symbolic hole in a Goddess statue, located in the Temple's underground sanctuary. The sanctuary is pushed through the earth, revealing stained glass that reveals the next direction of the journey.  After a fight in Gorak's lair with her opponent Chancara, Valina finds her dungeon friend Roland and has him join their party so they can find a map of the Tugarin Forest in which Alcaman's palace is hidden in a mountain and guarded by a [[dragon]]. They are trapped by Chief Onus who leads the native Tugarin [[Pygmy peoples|pygmy]] tribe and attempts to sacrifice them to the [[spider]]-like "creatures of the forest." But Mathayus' bellow causes the creatures to retreat, and the tribe to embrace them. Despite warnings of the beast, the heroes proceed towards the mountain, where they find the dragon is really a mechanical contraption.  Finally, they arrive at Alcaman's palace and open the hidden door into the mountain. Roland proves to be a traitor in Drazen's service and the usurper's men surround and fill the throne room of Alcaman. Mathayus and Valina fight the attackers, but Sorrell receives a mortal wound from Drazen. Armed with Sorrell's notes, Mathayus proceeds deeper into Alcaman's palace, rigged with traps that kill those with Drazen and finds the Crown of Alcaman believing its power to be the only hope of healing Sorrell. Putting it on, he is covered in fire, but does not burn. As he prepares to return to his comrades, Drazen overpowers him and takes the Crown. Drazen is judged unworthy and the Crown freezes him to death. Mathayus shatters Drazen's frozen body and revives Sorrell, who finally believes in magic, with the Crown.  The group leaves the mountain and seals the door with the Key and Crown inside, telling the remainder of Drazen's men that the power of Lord Alcaman was just a myth. Sorrell is crowned King once more, but gives his crown to Valina, who promises to build a kingdom based on "science and mathematics, truth and reason, and just a little bit of magic".  During the credits, Mathayus is relieved from his service to King Zakkour who allowed him to stay with Queen Valina in her service. Valina and Mathayus share a kiss as Gorak and Chancara are also present at the dinner.

 In 2002, shortly after [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]], Ray Kasten (Ejiofor), a [[counterterrorism]] agent for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and his friend Jessica "Jess" Cobb (Roberts), an investigator for the [[Los Angeles]] [[district attorney]]'s office, meet new ADA Claire Sloan (Kidman). Jess and Ray receive a call about an unknown female body found in a dumpster near a local [[mosque]], which Ray has been investigating for possible terrorist links. At the crime scene, both are devastated to discover that the victim is Jess's 18-year-old daughter, Carolyn (Graham), whose body has been bleached inside and out to destroy DNA evidence of both rape and murder.  Ray, who was supposed to meet Carolyn to plan a surprise party for Jess, feels responsible for what happened to her, while Jess feels the increasing need to move out of the city. While helping Jess pack, Ray notices pictures from a picnic thrown for law enforcement in which a young man is seen staring at Carolyn. Ray scans the photo and matches it to Anzor Marzin (Cole). D.A. Martin Morales (Molina) is reluctant to go after Marzin, fearing it would compromise the terrorism investigation. Officer Reggie Siefert (Kelly) brings in a suspect named Aban Ghazala (Amir Malaklou), who Ray realizes is not the killer.  Ray forces Siefert to admit that he set up Ghazala as a [[patsy]] to protect Marzin, Siefert's coveted [[informant]] in the terrorism probe. Ray and Detective Bumpy Willis (Norris) track down and arrest Marzin at [[Dodger Stadium]]. Claire argues with Ray over his methods while seemingly defending Marzin, saying he wasn't capable of the crime. Claire taunts Marzin, provoking him to [[indecent exposure|expose himself]] and punch her, saying he's going to give Claire what Carolyn got. Ray beats Marzin, which leads to Morales ordering Marzin released. As Marzin gloats, an enraged Ray suggests they kill him before he gets away, but Jess refuses to go that route. After his release, Marzin's van is found burned, destroying all evidence against him.  Thirteen years later, Ray, now head of security for the [[New York Mets]], returns to Los Angeles and reunites with Claire, now the D.A. Jess, who has been an [[anti-social behavior|anti-social]] shell since the loss of her daughter, is Claire's top investigator. Ray has found a man named Clay Beckwith (Cole), who he believes is Marzin living under an alias. The investigation eventually leads to a shootout with Beckwith in which Siefert is killed. Even though Beckwith and his men are arrested, Jess insists that Beckwith is not Marzin.  When Ray and Claire pay a visit to Jess's isolated farmhouse, she confesses that she found and killed Marzin thirteen years previously, shortly after Ray left Los Angeles. Later, Ray follows Jess into her barn and discovers that Marzin is actually alive, having been imprisoned in a cage for over a decade. Marzin begs Ray to ask Jess to talk to him. Ray pulls out his gun and leaves it with Jess as he goes outside and starts digging a grave. Ray hears Jess shooting Marzin. The two meet each other with a sense of relief while Claire officially closes Carolyn's case.

Self/less
 Billionaire New York real-estate tycoon Damian Hale ([[Ben Kingsley]]) is master of his own universe, until he is diagnosed with [[terminal cancer]]. Now on his deathbed, he finds a business card directing him to a man named Professor Albright ([[Matthew Goode]]), who informs him about a radical medical procedure called "shedding", in which one's consciousness is [[Mind uploading|transferred]] to an artificially grown healthy body. Damian decides to undergo the procedure, and follows Albright's instructions to stage his own public death. Albright transfers him into a new body ([[Ryan Reynolds]]) and prescribes medication to alleviate the vivid hallucinations which he claims are side effects of the procedure.  After a period of adaptation exercises, Damian starts a new life in New Orleans under the assumed name of Edward Kidner and quickly befriends his neighbor Anton ([[Derek Luke (actor)|Derek Luke]]). However, when he forgets to take his medicine, he subsequently suffers hallucinations of a woman and child. When Damian asks Albright about the hallucinations, Albright dismisses his concerns, but accidentally reveals that he knows details of the hallucinations that Damian did not tell him. Albright arranges for Damian to move to Hawaii for a change of scenery, but Damian, convinced the hallucinations are some kind of memory, identifies a landmark he saw in his vision and heads to St. Louis instead.  At a farmhouse outside of St. Louis, he finds the woman, Madeline ([[Natalie Martinez]]), who reacts to him as her apparently deceased husband, Mark Bitwell. Damian learns, much to his horror, that the body he is inhabiting belonged to another man who sold himself to Albright in order to gain the money he needed to pay for their daughter Anna's life-saving medical treatment. Shortly after arriving at the house Damian and Madeline are attacked by Albright's men, led by Anton, who reveals that he is one of Albright's employees. In a bid to escape, Damian severely wounds Anton and kills his accomplices. Damian and Madeline leave the farm and collect Anna from school, where they flee.  At a motel stop overnight, discovering he has no more of the medicine he needs, Damian uses a laptop computer to research "shedding" and discovers an ill, elderly Dr. Francis Jensen ([[Thomas Francis Murphy (actor)|Thomas Francis Murphy]]), now deceased, was the pioneer researcher in the field of [[transhumanism]]. In a video interview of Jensen, Damian notices a tic he shares with Albright. When he then sees a young Albright sitting next to Jensen in the same video, Damian concludes Albright was Jensen's assistant, and Jensen has shed himself into Albright's body.  Damian finds Dr. Jensen's wife, Phyllis, in a nursing home in [[New Orleans]] and tries to get her to reveal where her husband's research is, but she does not know due to suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease|alzheimer's]]. Damian then lures Jensen to the facility and confronts him. Jensen explains his motivations, but Damian rejects them. Jensen reveals that the pills will eventually eliminate the "Mark" personality of the body Damian is inhabiting, but if he stops taking the pills, his consciousness will die and Mark will reassert control of his body.  As they leave to go to the medical lab, more assassins show up. Jensen escapes, while Damian struggles with another man whom he recognizes as Anton in a new body, due to the necklace that he is wearing. Damian is almost overpowered, but Madeline saves him when she intervenes and wounds Anton. Anton then reveals to Damian that he has shed multiple times, and the process is easier the more often it is done. While Damian confiscates Anton's pills, Anton taunts Madeline to ask her 'husband' why he can't answer personal questions about their life. Damian, Madeline, and Anna then escape again.  After they are safely away, Madeline confronts Damian over his behavior and lack of knowledge of their personal details, and forces him to reveal to her all that has happened. He then takes her and Anna to his old friend Martin O'Neill ([[Victor Garber]]) and convinces him to arrange for Madeline and Anna to flee to the Caribbean. However, he and Madeline discover Anna playing with Martin's young son Tony (Dylan Lowe), who died two years ago; Martin admits that he used shedding to save his son, and that Jensen's men are waiting for them. Damian then reveals the dark secret behind shedding to Martin, who believed that the bodies were artificially grown in a lab and is shocked to find out that his son's new body is really someone else's son. Damian flees to distract Jensen's men while Martin, Madeline, and Anna try to escape through a forest. In an extended car-chase scene, Damian manages to crash Anton's car with him in it and defeat his pursuers, but not before they realize that Damian is alone in the vehicle. Realizing this, Jensen's henchmen recapture Madeline and Anna.  With Martin's assistance, Damian stops taking his medicine in order to experience more of Mark's memories, hoping they will lead him to Jensen. This succeeds, and Damian pursues Jensen to a lab built in an abandoned warehouse. There, Jensen captures him and attempts to shed Anton into Mark's body, but Damian, remembering that metal interferes with the shedding process, hides a bullet casing in his mouth, therefore sabotaging the procedure and killing Anton in the process. Then, Damian masquerades as Anton and rescues Madeline and Anna, who are being held at the lab as possible shedding receptacles. Damian then kills Jensen with a flamethrower. After they escape, Damian arranges for Madeline and Anna to flee the country as planned. Damian, using the Edward Kidner alias, visits his own estranged daughter Claire ([[Michelle Dockery]]) and delivers her a letter that serves to reconcile Claire with her estranged father. He then heads to the Caribbean and stops taking his medicine, dying peacefully. The real Mark reawakens in his own body and discovers a video message from Damian (in Mark's body) that was recorded before his death thanking him for the time he gave him. Mark then reunites with his family at last.

Next week, she is being married off, against her wishes, to a young industrialist by the name of Debashish Bhatto and this is her last show. Deepa has nothing against Debashis. He is good-looking, extremely well-to-do and interested in the arts, but she is in love with someone else. She dare not tell her family about him because all hell would then break loose.  Nripati Laha, the founder member of the group, and Deepa’s brother Vijay look forward eagerly to the wedding as they both have much to gain from this alliance. Nripati hopes to get a solid sponsorship for the Swapnochari through Debashis’s ‘Bhatta Group of Industries’.However, there are several others who are not so happy. Prabal Gupta, the director of the group theater is not only unhappy, but angry in the bargain. He considers Deepa to be his creation as he is the one who had trained her painstakingly into becoming an actress she is today. Deepa leaving the group means that the lead actress would be gone!Deepa’s wedding takes place right on schedule the week after the show. All the members of the group attend and all put up a joyous front. Debashis is already enchanted by his beautiful bride; the only thing that bothers him is the sullen expression on her face.  Debashis’s fleeting anxiety about his bride’s state of mind turns out to be eerily clairvoyant! When he tries to pull her into his arms after they are alone in their flower-bedecked bedroom at last that night, she draws back and informs him that she is in love with someone else. Debashis is stunned.  Debashis takes some time to digest this. Then, being the gentleman that he is, he offers to give her a divorce so that she can marry the man she loves. But Deepa is not ready for that either. It would be impossible for her to go back to her family. She pleads with him to let her stay on in his household as his legal wife until her lover is ready. Then she will ask him to grant her a divorce.  The very same night — the night of Deepa’s wedding –a beggar is killed on the streets of Kolkata. The sky is strangely dark and, just before the murder, crows gather inexplicably on the overhead wires and railings of the nearby park as if in foreboding of something evil. No one pays much attention to the news of the murder the next morning and among those who do; many feel that there are too many beggars in Kolkata anyway. In any case, the story is hardly noticed as it is featured in a small unnoticeable corner in one of the back pages. Such murders are common enough occurrences in big cities to merit much attention; the only thing uncommon being the murder weapon: a porcupine quill driven clean through the heart of the victim from the back!  One person does notice it though — . Byomkesh Bakshi whose habit it is to read several papers from end to end every morning looking for exactly such small, unnoticed stories. As Byomkesh tells his dear friend and assistant Ajit of the incident and rues the fact that killers of Kolkata are becoming creative these days, footsteps are heard on the staircase outside followed by the ringing of the doorbell. It is Deepa’s brother Vijay. He looks distraught and appeals to Byomkesh for help. It appears that Vijay had been to visit Debashis and Deepa the morning after the wedding and that Debashis had blamed him and Nripati squarely for having been architects of this marriage when they knew fully well that Deepa had a secret lover! Debashis also told him that the marriage had not been consummated because of this complication. Vijay now wants Byomkesh to help him find Deepa’s secret lover. Once he knows the guy’s name, Vijay will fix him so that he never dares to disturb Deepa again. Byomkesh tells Vijay that his job is not to look for secret lovers of women especially since in this case, Deepa is in no way to blame for a marriage that has been forced upon her. Byomkesh is far more interested in the mystery of the beggar murdered with the porcupine quill. And, coincidentally, the DC DD of Kolkata police has just rung him up to solicit his help in solving the strange case of the porcupine quill murder!  Meanwhile Deepa’s unusual married life continues. She and Debashis are courteous to each other, but no more than that. They sleep in separate bedrooms but put up an appearance of conjugal bliss in front of outsiders. Deepa refuses to meet anyone, especially her family members; she remains mainly at home and keeps entirely to herself. Soon after, she receives a gift packet with no name on it. When she opens it, she finds a beautiful pair of designer earrings made of some strange horn like substance. She puts them on, more out of curiosity than anything else, and then decides to keep them on as they are so striking in appearance. Yet another gift comes along — this time from ’a real sender’. Debashis hands her a mobile phone. He has been feeling sorry for her despite what she has done to him and has bought her the phone so that she may at least keep in touch with her friends.  But, once she is alone in her room, Deepa starts sending text messages to a certain number instead of calling anyone. The killer does indeed strike again, very soon. In fact, the strange marriage and even stranger murders play themselves out like unconnected tracks running parallel to each other. Terror grips the city after this. The Porcupine has struck twice in the same night! Television channels pitch in enthusiastically. Kapil’s editor is delighted and puts him on the job of covering the grisly crimes. Kapil is on his toes all day, reporting continuously from the scenes of the recent murders.<ref></ref>  
Set the Thames on Fire
 Art is a down-on-his-luck lowlife pianist, whose life has stalled in a grief filled frozen moment – shipwrecked on the lonesome shore of his own life. Sal is a cracked pinball machine; full of energy, light and fun but out of control and dangerously chaotic. Having escaped from Bedlam Psychiatric Hospital, Sal is an easy-going, sweet natured imp of the perverse and agent of trouble.  The two boys meet whilst working as the help at a vile cocktail party for the rich and corrupt. The boys make a connection, finding refuge in each other – the only shipmates on a drunken boat, tossed about on a stormy London sea. At the cocktail party, the elegant and sophisticated Colette reads the dangerously paranoid Impresario’s tarot cards, predicting the demise of the old, bloated and corrupt. This sets in motion a series of strange events that may connect together like a great unseen plan, or may simply be the random coincidences of an uncaring universe.  The boys become caught up in the cogs as they turn, like two rats caught in the machinery of Big Ben, as the cogs drags them ever nearer a terrifying climax.  A confrontation between two different natures – the Impresario’s relentless "progress" of greed and brutality, and the boys’ urge for freedom, friendship and beauty. And ever present in the background is the dark and powerful Thames – representing the forces of nature, chance and instinct – but who will it back in this battle of heart and imagination versus bestial brutality?

The parents keep this family tragedy a secret from their daughter. When Bohdanka, on the threshold of adulthood, learns about her family’s curse, she decides she has to save her brothers. The local witch advises her that she must weave her brothers shirts. But not just any shirts – alone, without anyone’s help, she must harvest nettle, spin the thread, weave the cloth, and make every stitch on the shirts herself. She must do all this without uttering a single word.  Bohdanka sets out on a journey during which she not only tries to save her brothers, but during which she also gets to know herself, her personality, her flaws, her desires. She meets the shy and stuttering prince Bartoloměj and, thanks to a magic comb the witch lent her, she is able wordlessly gather fragments of the past and learn the sad fate of prince Bartoloměj’s kingdom.  The more Bohdanka and Bartoloměj get to know each other, the closer they become. Bartoloměj takes Bohdanka to the castle, and Bohdanka thus gets to look into life at the court, ruled by Queen Alexandra, Bartoloměj’s mother. Alexandra’s plan has always been to rid her son Bartoloměj of his right to the throne, so that her younger son Norbert could become king instead. Bohdanka’s presence at the castle disrupts this plan, as Bartoloměj, in his growing love for Bohdanka, has been gaining confidence and has even begun to behave like a future king.  At first, Alexandra tries to get rid of the mute girl as easily as possible, but when Bartoloměj asks for Bohdanka’s hand in marriage, Alexandra feigns happiness for the young couple and begins working on a more intricate plan to set Bartoloměj, along with the entire royal court, against Bohdanka.  Bohdanka sees through Alexandra’s intentions – partially thanks to the magic comb which lets her look into the past - but at a crucial moment, when Bohdanka has to decide whether to finish her task and save her brothers, or to speak and explain the misunderstanding which is to separate her from Bartoloměj, Bohdanka decides to continue her work, risking her life but keeping her promise. Only once she finishes her task and frees her brothers is she finally able to explain everything.  We find out that Queen Alexandra never had the right to the throne, came to be queen by using lies and intrigue and that her latest ploy was to get rid of Bartoloměj and Bohdanka by force, so as to retain her power.  The story ends with fragments of the past fitting together to create the whole picture, which shows all the characters in a true light and uncovers their deepest motives. Bartoloměj becomes king, former Queen Alexandra ends up in exile, and Bohdanka’s brothers are reunited with their much-tried parents.

Shamitabh
 Danish ([[Dhanush]]), born mute in rural [[Igatpuri]], loves films. He acts out scenes before his class, amazing his peers and teacher, and spends all his time in the local Paradise theatre. He even tries to board a Mumbai bus to go become a film star but is pulled off by his mother's friends. When he grew up, Danish brings [[Pakora|pakodas]] to the local video-store owner and watches films every day. His mother feigns illness and keeps him from going to Mumbai but when she dies, Danish leaves for Mumbai.  Danish gets into Film City past its guards and finds shelter in an actor's vanity van, hiding under the sofa. Travelling around in the empty van, Danish desperately tries to meet directors but cannot. He meets assistant director Akshara Pandey ([[Akshara Haasan]]) who is impressed by his talent. She shows his video, shot on her phone, to her director, Anay Verma ([[Ivan Sylvester Rodrigues|Ivan Rodrigues]]), but he rejects casting a mute hero. Akshara's father, a doctor, treats Danish after he gets into a fight with security guards. On his recommendation, Danish and Akshara arrive at Finland to meet his friend who shows Danish their new "Live Voice Transfer Technology", that uses embedded micro-recorders and ear-pieces and enables mute people to communicate via a "borrowed" voice.  Akshara and Danish return to Mumbai with the equipment and find Amitabh Sinha ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]), a failed actor and drunkard. Although he was rejected because of his deep baritone, the duo are actually impressed with the same baritone and ask him to lend his voice to Danish; he accepts, and signs an agreement not to disclose himself as Danish's voice. Their first project becomes a major success and numerous film offers come for Danish, now named "Shamitabh" (a [[portmanteau]] of Danish and Amitabh).  Amitabh, who is officially Danish's valet, also wants a role in accepting or rejecting scripts. He tells Danish his voice is as big&nbsp;— if not bigger&nbsp;— a star than Danish's talent. The friction between them grows. Amitabh gets fever and Danish makes him take an injection. In retaliation, Amitabh makes Danish accepts singing a song in his new film. Amitabh sings the song "Piddly", but is horrified by its picturisation of toilets across snowy peaks, suggested by Danish to tease him.  Danish arrives at London to deliver a speech which Amitabh voices for him, but Danish treats him like a servant. Amitabh later becomes inebriated and attacks a police officer, leading to his arrest, but Danish bails him out.  When the duo return to Mumbai, journalists ask Danish if he is apologetic about the incident. Danish tells Amitabh to say that he apologizes from his servant, Amitabh's side. Enraged, Amitabh mischievously makes him reply in negative, much to Danish's fury. The duo parts ways; Danish plays a mute person in his next film, while Amitabh dubs for another actor in a different film. Both films fail.  Meanwhile, Akshara, who had gone to Sikkim to write a script for Danish, returns but berates Danish when he refuses to apologise to Amitabh. She forces Amitabh and Danish to reconcile.  A media reporter, having discovered the secret that Danish was born mute, threatens to expose the duo but they decide to tell the truth and surprise the world. Danish and Amitabh accept to work in Akshara's debut film, and Danish tells Akshara that he loves her. While Danish and Amitabh are on the way to Akshara's film ceremony, a car accident occurs; Danish is killed while Amitabh's [[larynx]] is damaged, making him mute.  Some time later, Amitabh paces around Danish's grave with Akshara's script, imagining that Danish is still alive and practicing his lines for the film.

Finding this hard to believe, he calls up the bank's customer care where he hears that his account has been upgraded to the 'platinum class'. Before this news can sink in his system, he gets a call from an unknown number with the caller claiming to be the notorious gangster Dawood. Dawood then "orders" Prithvi to get into a mutually profitable deal with him where he has to deliver large sums of money at different times and places to Dawood's henchwoman lady Rasheeda ([[Talia Bentson]]).  Prithvi immediately calls up his roommate Sam ([[Rannvijay Singh]]), who thrives on women and money (easy money, to be precise), to share the news with him. Just as the duo is busy planning what to do with the whopping amount of money, the bank's Vice President D.K. Thawani ([[Anupam Kher]]) shows up on his doorstep to offer his personalised service to his 'esteemed customer'. All of this startles Prithvi to no end. Seeing Prithvi behave 'abnormally', his ever-so-concerned girlfriend Megha ([[Tena Desae]]), who is a TV journalist by profession, immediately calls her top-cop uncle G.S. Chaddha ([[Yuri Suri]]) who then starts tracking Prithvi's phone calls. Prithvi's confidence levels take a downturn when he discovers that D.K. Thawani is actually Dawood's man in the disguise of a bank manager. Just when things are getting settled down, life again takes a upturn for Prithvi when he hears the breaking news about Dawood's sudden death on the TV channels. Needless to say, Dawood's death means that Prithvi becomes the sole owner of the remaining 60 crores in his bank account.  Prithvi tells the whole story to Megha and they both decide to go to police the next day but Sam convinces them to enjoy and party for once before returning all the money. While at the club Prithvi gets a call from Dawood and Megha gets abducted only to be found unconscious in Prithvi's car. Shocked by this incident Sam confesses to them that the calls from Dawood were fake and were made by Rasheeda (whose real name is Rachel). Sam has actually won an online lottery from a link send by Rachel but by using Prithvi's Debit card. On winning the prize money of 100 crores the whole amount got transferred in Prithvi's bank account. Hence Sam and Rachel faked the Dawood calls to get all the money back from him.  By now Sam has found out that D.K. Thawani and Rachel are planning to kill him as well after they get all the money. They also realise that the lottery site is a fake and it was all a money laundering scheme which was devised by business tycoon Ram Sharan Oberoi to transfer black money to India. Prithvi and Sam realise they are in trouble as they will be soon interrogated by RBI and Police for transferring black money to India.  Prithvi then makes a plan and together they abduct Rachel. Then Prithvi makes a fake call (pretending to be Oberoi) to Thawani and steals all the money from his house. Later Prithvi goes to Thawani's office and records his confession on a hidden camera which results in Thawani and Oberoi being arrested. The film ends with Prithvi getting 2 crores reward money from the government but just as he thinks it is all over, he receives a call from the real Dawood...

Sicario (2015 film)
   In [[Chandler, Arizona]], [[FBI Critical Incident Response Group]] Agents Kate Macer ([[Emily Blunt]]) and Reggie Wayne ([[Daniel Kaluuya]]) lead a raid on a suspected Mexican cartel safehouse, where they discover dozens of decaying corpses and a booby trap that kills two policemen. Following the raid, Kate's boss recommends her for a [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] special joint task force, overseen by Matt Graver ([[Josh Brolin]]) and the secretive Alejandro Gillick ([[Benicio del Toro]]), to apprehend the [[Sonora Cartel]] lieutenant Manuel Díaz ([[Bernardo Saracino]]). Assured that the task force will bring Díaz and those responsible for the safehouse incident to justice, Kate joins.  The team travels in force to [[Ciudad Juárez]], Mexico, to extradite Díaz's brother and henchman, Guillermo Diaz (Edgar Arreola). To preempt a possible ambush, the team kills several suspected Mexican cartel gunmen — shocking the conscientious Kate. Alejandro tortures Guillermo and learns that there's a tunnel Díaz uses to smuggle drugs into the U.S.   Reggie and Kate begin to question the task force’s illegal and seemingly inexplicable methods. Finally, Matt reveals that the objective is not to apprehend Díaz as originally suggested, but to disrupt his drug operations to such a degree that Díaz will be summoned back to Mexico by his boss, elusive Sonora Cartel drug lord Fausto Alarcón. By following Díaz, they will bring Alarcón to justice.   To disrupt Díaz's cash flow, the team raids a bank used by his money launderers. Kate and Reggie want to use their findings from the raid to mount a legal case against Díaz, but are ordered to let it go — much to their frustration.  While commiserating at a bar, Reggie introduces Kate to Ted ([[Jon Bernthal]]), a friend and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] police officer. Kate and Ted go to her apartment, but as they become passionate, Kate realizes Ted is with the cartel. In the ensuing struggle, Ted begins strangling Kate, when Alejandro suddenly appears and subdues him. Alejandro and Matt reveal that they used her as bait, knowing the cartel would try to assassinate her after she was seen at the bank raid. Alejandro and Matt torture Ted into revealing the names of other officers working for Díaz.  They soon learn that Díaz is being recalled to Mexico, as they hoped. Kate questions the good news, pointing out that they have no jurisdiction in Mexico. Matt states that she and Reggie were simply being used, as working with U.S. law officers grants the C.I.A. legal permission to continue. Angered, Reggie advises that he and Kate leave the task force, but she insists on joining a task force raid on the tunnel to learn more about the operation's true nature. At the Mexican end of the tunnel, Kate sees Alejandro kidnapping one of Díaz's drug mules, a [[corruption in Mexico|corrupt]] Mexican police officer named Silvio ([[Maximiliano Hernández]]). Kate attempts to arrest Alejandro for his illegal act, but he shoots into her bulletproof vest before driving off with Silvio. Realizing that Alejandro is operating illegally with the task force’s support, and that there was never any intention of bringing Alarcón and Díaz to justice through legal channels, Kate confronts Matt.  Matt explains that they are attempting to return to a time when a single cartel, [[Medellín Cartel|Medellín]], ran the drug trade. This monopoly gave the U.S. more control. Alejandro, who worked for Medellín, was brought on to topple the Sonora Cartel by assassinating Alarcón, thus reducing cartel competition. Alejandro’s own motive is revenge: Alarcón had ordered the murder of Alejandro’s wife and daughter.  In Mexico, Alejandro forces Silvio to drive him to Díaz, kills Silvio, and forces Diaz to continue to Alarcón. Reaching Alarcón’s estate, Alejandro kills Díaz, all the guards, and the entire Alarcón family.  Alejandro appears in Kate's apartment, and forces her at gunpoint to sign a waiver legitimizing the operation. As he leaves, she aims her pistol at him, but cannot bring herself to pull the trigger.  In [[Nogales, Sonora]], Silvio's widow watches her son's soccer game. The game is briefly interrupted by the sound of gunfire, before continuing.

 Ulises becomes frustrated when he is stuck in a bus depot during a massive storm while his wife gives birth in nearby Mexico City. The elderly clerk, Martin, tells him that the storm has temporarily stopped the bus service. Intermittent broadcasts on Martin's radio report increasingly worse news, eventually revealing that the storm is suspected to be a worldwide phenomenon of unknown origin. Ulises attempts to call the hospital with the station's payphone, only to be disconnected after a brief exchange that only worries him further. Ulises asks to use Martin's phone, but Martin says he does not have an outside line.  Irene, a pregnant woman, takes shelter in the bus station. As she becomes flustered with Martin's disinterest in their plight, Ulises assists her and suggests she try to call for a taxi with the payphone. When she reports it is on the way, Ulises excitedly offers to share the fare with her. Ulises asks an older woman, Roberta, if she is also interested in sharing the fare, but she becomes agitated and responds in a language Ulises cannot understand. While they wait for the taxi, Irene goes to the restroom, where a cleaning woman, Rosa, surprises her and insists that she stay at the station. While Irene attempts to flee Rosa, Rosa has what appears to be an epileptic fit.  At the same time, three more people arrive at the station: Alvaro, Gertrudis, and Gertrudis's son, Ignacio. Hearing Irene's calls for help, the others assist her. Martin, his face covered in bandages, comes out of his office with a rifle and blames everything on Ulises. Confused, Ulises says he is just a miner who is worried about his wife. As Martin continues to rant, Roberta suffers the same epileptic fit as Rosa. Alvaro and Ulises disarm Martin. As Ulises ties up Martin, Alvaro assists Roberta. Alvaro, a medical student, becomes concerned when he sees Gertrudis inject Ignacio with an hypodermic needle. She insists Ignacio needs regular doses to remain calm.  After Alvaro excitedly recognizes Ignacio as a famous unsolved medical case, Ulises and Alvaro argue over their opposing political beliefs. All are stunned when Martin recovers and reveals that his face has morphed to look exactly like Ulises. Roberta, too, begins to show signs of facial hair similar to Ulises. Alvaro wrestles the rifle from Ulises and accuses him of being a government agent. Ulises insists he does not understand what the others are talking about, but they become panicked when Irene also transforms. Fearing that it is contagious, Alvaro attempts to leave the station, only to find the doors are both locked and bulletproof.  Alvaro and Irene investigate Martin's office at his urging. They find that all the photographs, statues, and posters now have Ulises's face. Ignacio locks Gertrudis and Martin in a back room, where Rosa has transformed and committed suicide. Ignacio shows Ulises a comic book about aliens who, instead of conquering Earth, steal humanity's individuality. Once everyone has transformed, humanity's memory is wiped, and the humans once again perceive themselves as individuals, not knowing they have lost their individuality. When Gertrudis escapes, she explains that Ignacio has caused the comic book to come true.  Ignacio reveals he was preventing them from leaving. When the others confront him, Ignacio uses his ability to change reality to stop them. As Ulises dies, he claims to not recognize the others' faces. In his wallet, they find a picture of Ulises, which they perceive as not looking like the bearded clone everyone else has transformed into; they surmise he was the first to transform. Irene dies during childbirth, and her baby has the cloned face. Ignacio collapses, and Roberta examines him. She says he made contact with the aliens and, not believing them to be real, mistakenly allowed them to control him. Gertrudis asks Roberta what to do next. Roberta replies, "Nothing."  Some time later, the police arrive and arrest Alvaro, blaming him for the deaths. Gertrudis and Ignacio leave for [[Tlatelolco, Mexico City]]. Narration announces that with few exceptions, Ignacio is the only one to remember or know what has happened, much like the comic book.

Sinister 2
 The film opens in an identical style to the first movie: a snuff movie depicting a family being hung up like [[scarecrow]]s with sacks over their heads in a cornfield and burned alive. It is revealed to be the nightmare of nine-year-old Dylan Collins, who is staying in a rural farmhouse next to a [[deconsecration|deconsecrated]] [[Lutheran]] church, with his twin brother Zach, and their mother Courtney ([[Shannyn Sossamon]]).  The Deputy from the [[Sinister (film)|first film]] is researching the murders connected to Bughuul and burning down the homes where each murder took place before another family can move into them, including the house where Ellison Oswalt and his family were murdered in the first film. Dylan is visited nightly by a group of ghostly children, led by a boy named Milo, who coerces him to watch "[[home movies]]" of families being murdered in various savage ways, being eaten alive by alligators, being electrocuted in a kitchen, buried alive in the snow on Christmas Day, and being strapped to chairs with their mouths forced open and having their teeth mutilated with drills. The Deputy arrives at the farmhouse to destroy it, but realizes Courtney and her sons are living there. He tells Courtney he is a private investigator, and she allows him to investigate the church on the property where a gruesome murder took place. The Deputy later stumbles across an article that shows Courtney and her abusive ex-husband Clint on their wedding day. Suddenly, articles about the church murder flood the screen, before the Deputy sees Bughuul on his laptop. He slams it closed.  Clint shows up at the farmhouse with police to try and take the boys but leaves after the Deputy threatens them, warning them that they need a court order. In this scene, it is also revealed that he was arrested as a suspect for the murder of the Oswalts. While he was cleared of the charge, he was fired for releasing classified information to Ellison. Courtney wants to leave with the boys but the Deputy advises her not to, knowing that each of the murders connected to Bughuul occurred only after the families had fled the homes where the previous murders had occurred. Courtney invites him to stay, and the two develop a budding romance. Deputy meets with a professor who has come into possession of a [[ham radio]] that belonged to Professor Jonas from the previous film, who has mysteriously disappeared. The professor said the ham radio first belonged to a Norwegian family who was murdered in 1973. He plays a recording: the young girl's voice on the tape screams "Bughuul can't hear me over your yelling, Mom!" in Norwegian.  Deputy deduces that Bughuul exclusively targets the children of the murdered families. He orders the professor to destroy the ham radio. Zach becomes jealous of the ghostly children who visit Dylan, and insists on having their attention. They show Dylan the video of the church murders. After Dylan refuses to watch the last movie, the children turn their attention to Zach and abandon Dylan. Clint arrives with the court order and Courtney is forced to leave with Zach and Dylan. The Deputy drives to Clint's home to warn them about the danger, but Clint threatens him. The next day, Zach, as directed by the ghost children, films Dylan. After realising he and his family have been poisoned, Dylan contacts the Deputy for help.  Courtney, Dylan, and Clint are drugged and hung on scarecrow posts with sacks over their heads in the cornfield. A possessed Zach lights Clint on fire and films him as he burns to death. Just as Zach is about to light Courtney on fire, the Deputy hits Zach with his car. He frees Courtney and Dylan and they flee into the cornfield. However, Zach survived being hit (due to demonic possession) and pursues them. He cuts half the Deputy's left-hand fingers off with a sickle.  Inside the home, the ghost kids try to help Zach find Courtney and Dylan. Just as Zach is about to kill Courtney and Dylan, the Deputy manages to break the camera, thwarting Zach's home movie and breaking the cycle. Zach is shamed by the ghost kids for failing to kill his family. Bughuul appears and places his hand on Zach's shoulder, causing Zach to decay and burst into flames. The house catches fire as the Deputy, Courtney, and Dylan escape.  Later, the Deputy finds the ham radio in his motel room. As a young girl's voice whispers "Deputy", Bughuul appears and the screen goes black.

The next morning, the sisters are awakened by their parents so that they can begin the process of cleaning up after the party. Maura offers to help pay for the house, so that her parents will not have an issue with selling, but they refuse, as they believe that Maura needs to stop helping since she is often unhelpful.

Social Suicide (film)
  The film is about a group of teenage friends who are regular viners, post their videos on internet with a hope of becoming popular. Main characters are Balthazar, Reese, Marc, Julia, and Julia's cousin Ty. Other chief characters are Detective Dalton, his staff of investigators including IT experts and a Psychologist, Laurence Emerson.  Balthazar is an obsessed guy who is always carrying a camera with hopes of getting a chance to make a video which can fetch him 1 million views/likes. He is taking medicines for anxiety and anger. His friend Reese is in love with Julia who came close with intent to make videos together. Both are popular tubers and people like them for what they post. However, Balthazar is submissive and socially awkward and is jealous of this couple.  The movie begins when Marc and Ty are found dead and a team of investigators take Balthazar into custody for interrogation. He seems scared and confused to the psychologist but deceptive to Detective Dalton from the beginning. One of the reasons Dalton is suspecting Balthazar to be the chief suspect because of his obsession with making videos. She has a teenage daughter who makes fitness videos in bikini to become popular and Dalton is upset by that. So probably she is taking out her anger at Bal when she suspects him without any evidence. But Balthazar too lies on several occasions and changes his version of the whole incident when he is scared. At these times, psychologist comes to his rescue. The film revolves around finding proof from a prime piece of evidence in the form of a memory card which has true version of what happened that night, filmed by Balthazar. The detectives have to see how much Balthazar is speaking the truth and whether there is something more to the story. To the viewer's surprize, the film takes a horrifying turn when the truth is finally revealed from the memory card video.  Most of these teenagers in the film are shown disturbed, lack family connection and are lonely. They take decisions which are misinformed and risky. They don't understand the consequences of their behaviors and interests. While leaving police custody, when the psychologist Emerson suggests Balthazar to stop making videos and go for participatory activities in the real social world, Balthazar seems totally ignorant of the message in his words and tells him that now he is going to make the video that deserves 1 million views. Psychologist supported Balthazar throughout the film with a hope of giving him warmth and understand his condition, but all went to waste as Bal was so occupied with his upcoming popularity. Bal seems to have no awareness of what harm this video craze has done to him and brought his friends in a trouble. This scenario can be found in everyday life too where parents and mental health experts struggle to make kids understand the consequences of their risky actions and unfortunately the hormonal rush of adolescence makes this difficult to achieve. The movie shows very closely the delicate make-up of the teenage mind and how things can go wrong if parents don't pay much attention and do not connect with them emotionally.

Son of Saul
 In October 1944, Saul Ausländer ([[Géza Röhrig]]), a [[Hungarian-Jewish|Jewish–Hungarian]] prisoner in the German extermination camp [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], works as a ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' member. Amongst other duties, he must salvage valuables from the clothing of the dead, drag their bodies from the [[gas chambers]] and scrub the floors immediately afterwards. He performs these daily tasks with a stoic, impassive expression, seemingly having been numbed by the daily horrors. One day, following the gassing, he comes upon the body of a boy who is somehow still breathing after having been gassed. From a distance, Saul witnesses a Nazi physician methodically suffocate the boy to ensure his death then call for an autopsy. Saul impulsively comes forth and insists on carrying the body himself to the prison doctor, Miklós ([[Sándor Zsótér]]), who he learns is a fellow prisoner and Hungarian. He is able to convince Miklós to not perform the autopsy as he intends to give the boy a proper Jewish burial, for which he needs a rabbi. He goes to Rabbi Frankel ([[Jerzy Walczak]]), who refuses and suggests that Saul perform the burial himself.  Another member of the ''Sonderkommando'', Abraham ([[Levente Molnár]]), talks about a rebellion against the [[SS]]-guards with ''[[Oberkapo]]'' Biedermann ([[Urs Rechn]]). While Abraham advocates an uprising, Biedermann prefers a plan to photograph the camp's atrocities and to smuggle the pictures outside to attract attention and help. Saul asks for another rabbi to help him bury the body and Abraham tells him of "the Renegade," a Greek who is supposedly a former rabbi. Saul in return offers his assistance in their plan and is instructed to go with a prisoner (Katz) to repair a shack; he is given a piece of jewelry for use as a bribe in case he's caught. When Saul and Katz arrive at the shack, Saul pretends to fix the front door's lock, while Katz takes out a camera from inside the shack and starts to take pictures of the cremation. Saul hears the guards and hides the camera outside in a drain. The guards search the shack, only to find nothing.  Saul then sneaks onto a truck for another ''Sonderkommando'' unit, heading to a nearby riverbank, where the ashes from the crematoria are dumped into the river. Saul finds the Renegade, who refuses to help him. Saul then threatens to alert the ''Oberkapo'' of the unit, Mietek ([[Kamil Dobrowolski]]), that the Renegade is a rabbi by reciting the ''[[Kaddish]]''. When the Renegade refuses yet again Saul throws the man's shovel into the water.  The rabbi jumps into the river in a half-hearted attempt to retrieve the shovel or drown himself. Saul, who can't swim, manages to bring the Renegade back to the riverbank and both are then taken to the SS-commandant of the unit ([[Christian Harting]]). After an interrogation, the Renegade is executed and Saul is allowed to go back to the unit.  Saul is then confronted by Mietek, who realizes that he is from another unit. To mollify Mietek, Saul gives him the piece of jewelry. Back at the camp, following roll call, Saul sneaks into Miklós's office where he is caught by a group of Nazi officers. One of them pushes Saul around like a puppet and makes a mockery of [[Jewish dances]], finally forcing him out of the room. After searching in vain for the boy's body, Saul confronts Miklós, who assures him that he has hidden it from the other doctors for safety. Saul sneaks into the autopsy room and takes the body back to his own barrack in a sack.  That night Saul is summoned to clean the dinner tables by SS-commandant Moll ([[Uwe Lauer]]). Biedermann walks in and is ordered to write up a list of seventy names. This leads Biedermann to believe that his unit will soon be gassed. Biedermann discloses the information to Abraham, who instructs Saul to head to the women's camp, where he will pick up a smuggled package of gunpowder from a prisoner named Ella. When Saul finds himself face to face with Ella, he clearly knows her. She calls him by name, clasps his hand, but he withdraws. After collecting the package, Saul deliberately falls into a line of newly arrived Hungarian Jews, who are being led into the woods for execution. Saul again looks for a rabbi among the arrivals. A Frenchman named Braun ([[Todd Charmont]]) approaches him and convinces Saul that he is a rabbi. Saul disguises Braun as a member of the ''Sonderkommando'' and sneaks him into the camp. When Saul arrives at the camp he is confronted by Abraham and realizes that during the turmoil in the woods he has lost the package. On further questioning, he says that the dead boy is his illegitimate son, an assertion Abraham says is not true.  The next morning during roll call, Miklós finds Saul and tells him that he needs a replacement body, similar to the one Saul has taken. The prisoners are then summoned into the crematorium to get back to work, where they discover that Biedermann and his unit have been gassed by the SS. Abraham starts a riot with the other prisoners and they attack the SS guards, starting the rebellion. After managing to escape from the crematorium, Saul retrieves the boy's body and escapes to the woods with Braun and few other prisoners. When they reach a river, Saul finds a chance to bury the body, only to discover that Braun is a fraud when he can't recite the ''[[Kaddish]]''. When he hears the guards approaching, Saul tries to carry the body across the river. Unable to manage the current with the added weight, he loses his grasp on the sack and is pulled out of the river by Rabbi Frankel as the body floats away. When the prisoners arrive at a shed in the forest, they start to discuss a plan to join the [[Home Army|Polish resistance]]. Saul notices a young peasant boy peeking into the shed and smiles at him, the only time he is shown with a smile. The boy runs away, and makes it a short distance before an SS officer grabs and silences him as guards run past in the direction of the shed. When they have all passed, the officer releases him, and the camera follows the boy into the woods, as the sound of gunfire echoes behind him.

Southpaw (film)
 Billy "The Great" Hope is an undefeated [[Professional boxing|professional boxer]] living in the suburbs of [[New York City]] with his wife Maureen and their daughter Leila. Billy's particular style of fighting often leaves him beaten and bruised. During a match in which he defends his [[light heavyweight]] world title, Billy sustains an eye injury as well as heavy blows to the face and body, leaving him coughing up blood for days. He is finally convinced by Maureen to retire before he becomes forever "punch-drunk". During the press conference at the post-match, an up-and-coming boxer Miguel "Magic" Escobar taunts Billy and tries to get Billy to fight him. At a charity event for the orphanage where he and his wife both grew up, Escobar is in attendance, and as Billy is leaving, Escobar threatens he'll take Maureen and his title away from him, and while Maureen tells Billy to let it go and go home with her, Billy's anger gets the best of him, leading to a brawl in which Maureen is accidentally shot and killed by Miguel's brother Hector, who flees.  Billy begins abusing alcohol and drugs while obsessively searching for Hector. He eventually gets a tip about Hector's whereabouts but only finds Hector's drug-addicted wife Maria, and leaves after learning Hector is a father. After attacking a referee out of frustration after throwing a fight, Billy is suspended for a year which means zero income, a six figure fine for ref assault, for lost wages and emotional trauma. In addition to top that off, the networks are suing him for breach of contract, leaving him indebted and his house and belongings being repossessed. He continues to spiral out of control and nearly dies after crashing his car in a suicide attempt, which also causes him to lose custody of Leila, who is put under care of [[Child Protective Services]] officer Angela Rivera. The incident drives Billy to sober up, but Leila cuts ties with him, blaming him for their predicament.  At the behest of friends, Billy gets a job as a cleaner at a gym owned by seasoned boxer Titus "Tick" Wills, and eventually convinces Tick to become his trainer. Billy's former manager, Jordan Mains, who is currently managing Miguel, arranges a fight between the two that could put Billy back in the spotlight. Tick is reluctant to train Billy, fearful he might be blinded by his vendetta against Miguel, but is motivated to do so when another of his students, Hoppy, is killed by his abusive father while attempting to defend his mother.  Seeing Billy's hard work after securing a job and keeping it, and his ability to show responsibilities of a father, the judge removes his visitation restrictions and congratulates him for his good work. Billy then takes Leila to his apartment where they have breakfast together and Leila asks if she can attend the fight. Billy, reluctant to let his daughter go to the fight because Maureen never wanted to expose their daughter to the violence in boxing, says he is unsure because Maureen used to make all the decisions for him. Leila asks if they can go visit Maureen's grave, where Leila convinces Billy to let her go to the fight to have someone by his side. Billy tells Leila that there will be people at the fight saying some harsh things, so Leila makes an agreement to go to the fight but stay only in the locker room with Angela, watching the fight via closed circuit television in the locker room.  As the match begins, Miguel has the upper hand against Billy, but, with Tick's advice, Billy has the chance to turn the tables in the final round by using the [[Boxing styles and technique#Defense|Philly shell defense]] and countering more aggressively with his left. As the round reaches its final minute, Billy pivots hard and, although fighting from a traditional stance, delivers a powerful left uppercut which knocks the champion down to the ground. Miguel manages to get up before the count is over and is saved by the bell. Billy is declared the winner by a split-decision and reunites with Leila in the locker room, where she forgives his past mistakes and they embrace.

Filled with remorse, Mitch looks at a photograph of his daughter Katherine as they drive down a nameless highway. Out in the desert, Mitch sees the creatures stalking them but does not tell Jack. In desperation, the pair pulls up to a run-down gas station. Inside, the men witness strange events as the creatures stalk them from afar. As Mitch and Jack attempt to escape, they pull up to the same gas station further down the road. Jack tries to leave as the creatures close in on the pair, and is killed.

Spare Parts (2015 film)
 Oscar Vazquez ([[Carlos PenaVega]]) goes to an American Forces Career Center to enlist into the [[U.S. Army]], while he is waiting for his interview, he sees a video announcement and brochures about a Marine Underwater Robotics Competition, an event sponsored by [[NASA]] and the [[United States Armed Forces]]. Although he distinguished himself as part of the [[Carl Hayden High School]] Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, he is forbidden to join because of his status as an undocumented immigrant and he is recommended not to present himself to any government office to avoid being reported to the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)]] agency. Vazquez lies to his mother about his progress in the Army and starts investigating about the Underwater Robotics Competition, looking for another way to move ahead in life.  Although he doesn't have any previous formal teaching experience, being between jobs, Fredi Cameron ([[George Lopez]]) interviews for a vacant [[substitute teacher]] position at [[Carl Hayden High School]]. The [[Principal (education)|principal]] ([[Jamie Lee Curtis]]) questions his job stability record, but eventually hires Cameron because of his [[Ph.D.]] and engineer credentials. After the interview, while in the school's parking lot, Lorenzo Santillan overrides Cameron's car temperature safety sensor for $20, so he can avoid a more costly repair job.  As part of his normal teaching responsibilities, Cameron is assigned to oversee an engineering club, where he meets Vazquez, who is looking for help to build a remotely operated underwater [[robot]] for the [[University of California, Santa Barbara|UCSB]] robotics competition. Cameron grudgingly accepts to help, even though he doesn't feel he is going to remain at the school for long.  Vazquez, looking for more kids to join the engineering club, talks to teacher Gwen Kolinsky ([[Marisa Tomei]]), who recommends Cristian Arcega ([[David Del Rio]]). After agreeing to help, Arcega takes the technical lead of the project and sketches an early design of the potential robot. Before starting to build it, Cameron suggests a [[prototype]] so they can do a proof of concept model.  Cameron starts to learn about the competition rules and requirements, which demands the robot to successfully complete a series of underwater tasks. Kolinsky offers to help teaching him about the [[BASIC]] programming language, which he is going to need to implement the robot's intelligence module.  After catching Santillan stealing from the principal's car, Cameron forces him to join the team and the now named Robotics Academic Club, so he can help with the mechanical design and building of the prototype. They later recruit Luis Aranda, for being strong enough to help lift the machine in and out of the pool.  Because of a lack of funds to see the project through, the team starts looking for spare parts and asking for donations from the local businesses, which raise $663.53, plus $134.63 given by Cameron himself. The small budget forces them to scale back the original design and to innovate in how the robot is constructed, which they end up naming "Stinky" because of the smell it had when they glued it together.<ref name=et></ref>   Needing to go from [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] to [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] also created problems because three of the four boys were undocumented immigrants from [[Mexico]].<ref name=fox></ref><ref name=hollywoodreporter></ref> The day before the competition, they had to fix a critical electrical problem, due to a leak in the case that protected the intelligence module, by using [[tampons]] to contain the water.   Facing several highly funded college teams, their robot finished the practical segment of the competition in fourth place with 75 points after missing three tasks. They were still hopeful for a chance to make it into third place because 30% of the total score would be based on the judges' technical evaluation and interview of the teams.   The night of the awards ceremony, they are given a Special Achievement award, which the team assumes is their final result. They are later surprised when they are announced as the champions of the event.  
The Spectacular Jihad of Taz Rahim
 Sabrina Jiwan is filming a news piece about a Muslim informant who was encouraged by the NYPD to entrap his victims. She proceeds to interview the informant, Taz Rahim, where he discloses his story.  Six months earlier, Taz was a struggling rapper living in Jackson Heights, New York, an immigrant Indian neighborhood. To make ends meet he sells marijuana and is one day arrested by an undercover cop. Around the same time, Sabrina receives permission from Mo Khan to make a documentary about his congressional campaign. Later he is revealed to have impregnated his mistress.  After spending a few days incarcerated, Taz meets with the undercover cop, whose real name is Nick Patel. Nick threatens to deport Taz unless he agrees to work as a Muslim informant.

They decide to report to the NYPD and Nick Patel that they believe Taz is a terrorist planning a terror attack. News of accusation spreads through the community and Mo asks Sabrina to fire Taz from her documentary. Nick is also thinking about removing Taz from the operation after the embarrassment but Taz is able to convince Nick to give him one more chance. Taz then convinces Ali Uncle to talk to Mo about giving Taz another chance. In a private discussion, Mo requests Taz to murder his mistress.   Taz feels that he has enough evidence to arrest Mo but is rebuted by Nick, whom wants to arrest Mo for terrorism not murder. Nick encourages Taz to pretend to move forward with Mo’s request in an attempt to uncover real terrorist activities. Unsure whom to trust, Taz moves forward with the plot to murder Mo’s mistress and then goes missing.   Nick begins to feel the heat from his superiors and interviews Sabrina about Taz’s disappearance and his connection to the murders of two women at a local strip club. Sabrina does not have any information. Later she is confronted by Taz on the street where he reveals the truth to Sabrina that he is being framed by Mo. Eventually, she is convinced of Taz’s innocence and she plans to help him gain his freedom by having him confess to being an informant.  Back in the present, Sabrina releases her interview with Taz. In a final showdown, Taz is able to get Mo arrested with an admission of guilt and the help of Nick. In the end, it is revealed that Taz faked the murder of Mo’s mistress in an effort to put pressure on Nick to arrest Mo. Taz now has his freedom but is scarred by all things he did to let people down in his life.  
Spectre (2015 film)
  A posthumous message from the [[M (James Bond)#Judi Dench: 1995–2015|previous M]] leads Bond to carry out an unauthorised mission in [[Mexico City]] on the [[Day of the Dead]], where he stops a terrorist bombing plot. Bond confronts Marco Sciarra, the terrorist leader and takes his ring, which is emblazoned with a stylised octopus. When he returns to [[London]], Bond is suspended from field duty by the new [[M (James Bond)|M]]. M is in the midst of a power struggle with Max Denbigh, whom Bond dubs "C", the head of a [[private intelligence agency|privately backed]] agency called the Joint Intelligence Service. C campaigns for Britain to join the global surveillance and intelligence initiative "[[Nine Eyes (signals intelligence)|Nine Eyes]]", and uses his influence to close down the [[00 Agent|'00']] field agent section, which he believes is outdated.  Bond disobeys M's orders and travels to Rome to attend Sciarra's funeral. He seduces Sciarra's widow, Lucia, who tells him Marco belonged to an organisation of businessmen with criminal and terrorist connections. Bond uses Sciarra's ring to infiltrate a meeting to select Sciarra's replacement, where he identifies the leader, Franz Oberhauser. After hearing Oberhauser give the order for the "Pale King" to be assassinated, Bond is pursued across the city by the organisation's assassin, Mr. Hinx. [[Miss Moneypenny|Moneypenny]] informs Bond that the Pale King is [[List of James Bond villains#Eon Productions films|Mr. White]], a former member of the organisation's subsidiary [[List of James Bond villains#Villainous organisations|Quantum]] who had fallen afoul of Oberhauser. Bond asks her to investigate Oberhauser, who was presumed dead years earlier.  Bond locates White in [[Altaussee]], Austria, where he learns that White is dying of [[thallium poisoning]]. He tells Bond to find and protect his daughter, Dr. Madeline Swann, who will take him to L'Américain; this will help him find Oberhauser. White commits suicide. Bond approaches Swann, and after rescuing her from Hinx, the two meet [[Q (James Bond)#Ben Whishaw: 2012–|Q]]. Q links Oberhauser to Bond's previous missions, identifying [[Le Chiffre]], [[Quantum of Solace|Dominic Greene]] and [[Raoul Silva]] as agents of the same organisation, which Swann identifies as [[SPECTRE|Spectre]].  Swann takes Bond to L'Américain, a hotel in [[Tangier]], and they discover that White left evidence directing them to Oberhauser's base at a crater in the [[Sahara]]. Taking a train to a remote station, Bond and Swann encounter Hinx, who gets ejected from the train in the ensuing struggle, and are escorted to Oberhauser's base. Oberhauser reveals that Spectre has been funding the Joint Intelligence Service while staging terrorist attacks around the world, creating a need for the Nine Eyes programme. In return, C will give Spectre unlimited access to intelligence gathered by Nine Eyes, allowing them to anticipate and counter-act investigations into their operations. Bond is tortured as Oberhauser discusses their shared history: after the younger Bond was orphaned, Oberhauser's father Hannes became his temporary guardian. Believing that Bond supplanted his role as son, Oberhauser killed his father and staged his own death, adopting the name [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]. He went on to form Spectre and target Bond. Bond and Swann overpower Blofeld and escape, destroying the base in an explosion and leaving Blofeld to die.  As the Moroccan facility was one node in a wider network, Bond and Swann return to London where they meet M, [[Bill Tanner]], Q, and Moneypenny with the intention of arresting C and stopping Nine Eyes from being activated. Swann and Bond are abducted separately, while the rest of the group proceed with the plan. After Q succeeds in preventing the Nine Eyes from going online, a struggle between M and C ends with C falling to his death. Bond is taken to the ruins of the old [[SIS Building|MI6 building]], scheduled for demolition after Raoul Silva's bombing. He encounters a now-scarred Blofeld, who tells him that Bond must escape before explosives are detonated or die trying to save Swann. Bond finds Swann and they escape by boat as the building collapses. Bond shoots down Blofeld's helicopter, which crashes onto [[Westminster Bridge]]. As Blofeld crawls from the wreckage, Bond confronts him but leaves him to be arrested by M, before leaving the bridge with Swann.

The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water
 A pirate named Burger Beard travels to [[Bikini Atoll]], where he obtains a magical book with the power to make any text written upon it real. The book tells the story of the young sea sponge named SpongeBob SquarePants and his adventures in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob loves his job as a fry cook at the [[Krusty Krab]] fast food restaurant, where he cooks hamburgers called Krabby Patties and works for Mr. Krabs, the Krusty Krab CEO. He has spent several years prudently protecting the secret Krabby Patty formula from a diminutive cyclops creature named Plankton, the owner of a competing restaurant called the Chum Bucket.   Until one day, Plankton attacks the Krusty Krab in an attempt to steal the formula. After a military battle involving giant foods and condiments, Plankton feigns surrender. He uses a decoy of himself to give Mr. Krabs a fake [[Penny (United States coin)|penny]], which the real Plankton then hides inside in order to gain access to Krabs' vault. As the decoy distracts Mr. Krabs, Plankton steals the formula, leaving a fake in its place. SpongeBob catches Plankton and the two engage in a tug of war over the formula, which magically disappears before anyone can claim it.   Without the secret formula, Krabby Patties cannot be made, causing customers to become ravenous. SpongeBob is the only one who believes Plankton is innocent and creates a giant soap bubble for them to fly away in. Bikini Bottom is immediately reduced to an apocalyptic wasteland due to the absence of the much-relied-on Krabby Patty. A page of the book is discarded in the ocean and lands on Sandy Cheeks' treedome and assumes the page is a sign from the "sandwich gods". SpongeBob proposes he and Plankton team up to find the formula. SpongeBob tries to explain the concept of teamwork to Plankton, who does not quite understand. Together, they decide to travel back in time to the moment before the formula disappeared. The two then head to the Chum Bucket to rescue Karen who has been held captive by SpongeBob's friend, Patrick, whom they intend to help power the time machine. They assemble the machine and end up traveling far into the future, where they meet Bubbles, a magical dolphin who acts as an overseer of the galaxy, and inadvertently get him fired. SpongeBob and Plankton succeed in retrieving the formula, but it turns out to be the fake one Plankton had left.   Burger Beard converts his pirate ship into a [[food truck]] to sell Krabby Patties at a beach community. Sandy suggests a sacrifice be made to appease the gods. As the town attempts to sacrifice SpongeBob by executing him using a metal krabby patty shaped crusher, he and Mr. Krabs smell Krabby Patties. The townsfolk follow the scent, which leads to the surface. Bubbles returns and, revealing that he hated his job, repays SpongeBob by granting him and his sea creature friends the ability to breathe on land; Plankton also joins by stowing away in SpongeBob's sock. Bubbles launches SpongeBob and the others out of his blowhole to the surface.   The team soon lands on a beach and finds the source of the Krabby Patty scent: Burger Beard's food truck. Burger Beard reveals he had stolen the formula by using the book to rewrite the story and then uses it to banish the gang to Pelican Island. SpongeBob uses the book's page that Sandy had to transform himself and the others into superheroes with special powers—The Invincibubble (SpongeBob), Mr. Superawesomeness (Patrick), Sour Note (Squidward), The Rodent (Sandy), and Sir Pinch-a-Lot (Mr. Krabs) but leave the page (and Plankton) behind. They return and find Burger Beard, who runs away with the formula, forcing the team to give chase. During the ensuing battle, the team manages to destroy the book, but Burger Beard overpowers them one by one.   Plankton then appears as a muscle-bound hero named Plank-Ton and assists them. Plankton and SpongeBob create one final attack to defeat Burger Beard and retrieve the Krabby Patty formula. After sending Burger Beard flying to Bikini Atoll, Plankton returns the formula to Mr. Krabs, having learned the value of teamwork. The gang uses the final page's magic to return home to Bikini Bottom. With Krabby Patties back, the city is finally returned to normal and Plankton re-assumes his role as business rival, thus returning everything to the [[status quo]].  
SPL II: A Time for Consequences
 Kit is a Hong Kong undercover cop who becomes a drug addict to infiltrate a crime syndicate which has been kidnapping people and sending them to Thailand, where the victims are killed and have their organs sold in the black market. The mastermind behind the syndicate, Mr Hung, has a rare heart condition and needs to undergo a heart transplant to prolong his life. Hung's younger brother is the ideal donor for a heart.  When Hung sends his men to kidnap his brother, the situation goes haywire and a gunfight breaks out because the police have been tipped off by Kit about the kidnappers' plan. Hung's brother is injured during the shootout but is rescued by the police. Kit, on the other hand, escapes with the kidnappers but his cover is blown. Hung's men kill kit's friend and knock Kit himself unconscious and sends him to a prison in Thailand. The chief warden, Ko Chun, works for Hung and has been keeping the kidnapped victims alive in the prison before they are killed for their organs. Kit is made to serve a life sentence in the prison.  While in prison, Kit attempts to escape twice and fights with the prison guard Chatchai but ends up being subdued every time. Chatchai's daughter has [[leukaemia]] and needs to undergo a [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|bone marrow transplant]] to survive. Chatchai witnesses Ko Chun's illegal activities and brutality but forces himself to remain quiet because he does not want to lose his job. The donor who agreed to donate bone marrow to Chatchai's daughter is Kit.  Back in Hong Kong, Hung reveals himself to Kit's uncle and supervisor, Wah, who is keeping a close watch on Hung's brother in hospital. Hung threatens Wah to hand over his brother to him in exchange for Kit. Although Wah initially agrees, he changes his mind later and hides Hung's brother in his friend's house. He then leaves his subordinates behind to guard Hung's brother while he tracks down Kit's location in Thailand and travels there. An angry Hung then sends his right-hand man Ah-Zai, a dangerous knife-wielding asssasin to follow Wah's subordinates and kill them and take Hung's brother hostage. Ah-Zai easily murders every cop he spots and snaps a picture of Hung's brother to Hung.  In Thailand, Wah bribes Kwong, Chatchai's colleague, and enters the prison to find Kit. Shortly after Kit and Wah are reunited, they are discovered by Ko Chun, who captures them and orders Chatchai and Kwong to escort them to the hideout where victims are killed and have their organs removed. At the hideout, Kit and Wah break free from captivity and fight their way out. On the other hand, Chatchai and Kwong change their minds and turn back to help Kit and Wah. Kit, Wah and Kwong manage to escape despite sustaining very serious injuries during the fight; Chatchai is captured by Ko Chun's men, who tie him up and torture him.  Meanwhile Hung's brother is brought to a medical centre in Thailand for the heart operation. However, Kit breaks into the medical centre, defeats Ah-zai in a fight by breaking his legs and knocking him out unconscious, and takes Hung hostage. He then demands that Ko Chun bring Chatchai to him in exchange for Hung. A fight breaks out when Ko Chun and his men show up with Chatchai. Kit and Chatchai team up and defeat all of Ko Chun's men. At the same time, Hung breaks free from his restraints and attacks his brother, but his medical condition deteriorates and he becomes blind as a consequence. He dies as he tells his brother not to fear himself.  Kit and Chatchai are seemingly no match for Ko Chun after engaging him in a long fight. At one point, Chatchai is knocked out after being stabbed by Ko Chun, who then proceeds to pound Kit against the window until the glass shatters. While in his unconscious state, Chatchai has a vision of his daughter in danger and immediately gets up and knocks Ko Chun out of the window. However, when he realises Kit has also fallen out of the window, he throws out a chain for Kit to hold on to, but Ko Chun grabs the chain instead. Kit then grabs on to Ko Chun's tie and eventually strangles him to death while dangling from his tie. Chatchai stretches out his hand and pulls Kit back to safety. The movie ends with Sa now growing up narrates that she got the transplant and remembers Chatchai hugging his daughter while Kit watches from a distance away.  
Spooks: The Greater Good
 Set several years after the end of the [[Spooks (TV series)|TV series]], [[Harry Pearce]] ([[Peter Firth]]) is still head of the [[counter-terrorism]] department (Section D) at [[MI5]]. Harry's team is transporting apprehended terrorist Adem Qasim ([[Elyes Gabel]]) through London when the convoy is attacked, allowing Qasim to escape and a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative to be killed. MI5 is humiliated in the press, and relations between British and American intelligence agencies are frayed. Realising that the CIA will demand a scapegoat and that he is soon to be decommissioned from MI5, Harry seemingly commits suicide by jumping off [[Lambeth Bridge]] into the [[Thames]].  However, it's quickly revealed Harry is alive and has faked his death so he can investigate his suspicions that Qasim's transport was sabotaged by someone high up in MI5 who is trying to destroy the organisation from the inside. Before Qasim's arrest, Harry had tasked his former section chief, [[Erin Watts]] ([[Lara Pulver]]), with going undercover inside his terrorist cell, and is quickly able to use her information to track down the fugitive Qasim, who is hiding in the English countryside. Harry does not call in MI5 and instead meets with Qasim to offer him a deal: he will get Qasim "what he wants" if he gives him the MI5 contact who helped him escape. Qasim responds by revealing he discovered Erin was an undercover agent and has taken her hostage. He shoots Erin in the stomach and tries to force Harry to finish her himself lest she die a slow death which will be recorded for her daughter to see. Harry can't bring himself to do it until Erin guides his hand in hers to shoot her and spare her daughter the video. After this, Qasim agrees to Harry's deal.  Meanwhile, Will Holloway ([[Kit Harington]]) is picked up in [[Moscow]] by MI5 operative Hannah Santo ([[Eleanor Matsuura]]) and taken back to meet with a group of senior intelligence figures; [[Director General of MI5|MI5 Director General]] Oliver Mace ([[Tim McInnerny]]), [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|JIC]] Chairman Francis Warrender ([[David Harewood]]), MI5 Head of Counter-Intelligence Emerson ([[Elliot Levey]]) and MI5 Deputy Director General Geraldine Maltby ([[Jennifer Ehle]]). It's revealed Will's father worked with Harry until he was killed in action during a mission in [[Berlin]]. Thereafter Harry visited regularly throughout Will's childhood and eventually recruited him as a section D officer. Will worked closely with Harry for several years as his father did, until Harry decommissioned him citing poor performance, leaving Will with a serious grudge. The intelligence officials were not fooled by Harry's death and want Will to find him and bring him in. Will is reluctant at first but is convinced when Mace suggests Harry has information about his father's death he has not revealed.  Harry contacts Will using an old spy trick they once used to exchange information, and then organises a meet with him. Will is accompanied by an MI5 surveillance team, but Harry utilises an elaborate series of misdirections and location changes to leave the team behind and talk to Will alone. Harry reveals his suspicions about a traitor inside MI5 and asks for Will's help. Will refuses to trust Harry, but does start investigating the theory without notifying MI5. He meets with June ([[Tuppence Middleton]]) a section D officer who was involved in the botched prisoner transport, and she joins Will to investigate her partner on that mission: Robert Vass ([[Michael Wildman]]) Searching Vass' place they find bank statements indicating a pay-off and, when he arrives home, there is a fight and June kills Vass.  Later that night, the intelligence chiefs are attending an opera with some [[NATO]] officials. After the show, a [[Suicide attack|suicide bomber]] corners JIC Chairman Warrender in the lobby and detonates, killing him alongside several other intelligence figures and military chiefs. Qasim takes credit on the news afterwards, citing it as a targeted attack on the elite rather than the public, but he is privately dissatisfied with the government response so starts to plan an attack on [[Oxford Circus]] that will kill hundreds of civilians. Harry reveals to Will that what Qasim wants from him in exchange for the contact who helped him is his wife, who MI5 traded to the [[Federal Security Service|FSB]]. Harry travels to Berlin and uses his connections there to organise a trade with the FSB—information for Qasim's wife, but Will and June intervene and attempt to take Harry back to England. Harry quickly realises June is working against them (having planted the evidence against Vass and killing him before he could deny it) and convinces Will she intends to kill them. They capture June who reveals she has been taking MI5 orders—she is so blindly loyal to the service she has been doing the traitor's work unknowingly. They leave her in Berlin, and meet with the FSB as Harry planned—unfortunately they discover Qasim's wife has died in FSB custody. They take her body and organise a meet with Qasim, claiming she is alive.  Back in the UK, Harry and Will are able to recruit Hannah to their cause, and she pretends to be Qasim's wife. Harry also recruits his old friend, retired analyst [[Malcolm Wynn-Jones]] ([[Hugh Simon]]) to monitor surveillance during the exchange. However, Qasim's agent is not fooled by Hannah's disguise and the operation is botched. Realising their original plan won't work, Harry goes off comms and, after confirming for Qasim that his wife is dead, makes a new deal with him. Fearing what deal Harry might have made, Will demands Hannah call in [[Specialist Firearms Command|SCO19]]—they arrive, arresting Harry and Will and taking them back to MI5 HQ.  Harry reveals that Qasim has given him the location of his terrorist cell, allowing MI5 to completely neutralise the pending attack and apprehend almost all of Qasim's men. While Mace, Emerson and Maltby are interrogating Harry to discover the other side of the deal, Qasim bursts into the room with armed men, killing several personnel. To their horror, Harry reveals that for his side of the deal he gave Qasim the knowledge necessary to infiltrate MI5. After Qasim shoots and kills Calum Reed ([[Geoffrey Streatfield]]), Mace steps up and insists Qasim kill him and leave the others alone, but after Emerson takes credit for sabotaging the prisoner transport, Qasim kills him instead. While Qasim is distracted, Will works with June to get the upper hand with Qasim's men, and is able to kill them and Qasim, ending the siege. Now aware that Harry was right about there being a traitor, Mace lets him go before the authorities arrive. Will catches up to Harry and demands an explanation—Harry explains it was the only way to stop the attack and kill the traitor, and that although people still died, it was preferable to the hundreds who would have died in the attack.  A week later, Harry meets with Geraldine Maltby at a seaside home where she is playing with her niece. While her niece is outside, Harry tells her that he knows she was the one who sabotaged the prisoner transport and let Qasim escape, Emerson just claimed credit in order to protect her. She intended to destroy MI5's reputation so that it could be quietly absorbed by the Americans, who would then repay her by making her Director General of MI5, replacing Mace. Geraldine refuses to accept any consequences for her actions, so Harry reveals she doesn't have to because he poisoned her lunch hours before, and she has only two hours left to live. Harry later meets with Will beside the Thames and is warned that Ruth's grave is being watched so he can no longer visit it.  Harry tells Will that the real reason he decommissioned him wasn't because he wasn't good enough, but to protect him out of respect for his father. Harry then leaves, his future unclear. The movie ends with a photo negative snapshot, a trademark of the TV show.  
Spy (2015 film)
 Susan Cooper is a 40-year-old, single, desk-bound [[CIA]] employee who remotely assists her partner, [[field agent]] Bradley Fine, on a mission. Fine accidentally kills arms dealer Tihomir Boyanov as he sneezes during a confrontation before extracting the location of a [[suitcase nuke]] from him. Susan uncovers evidence that Rayna, Boyanov's daughter, has contacted Sergio De Luca, a suspected broker with ties to various terrorist groups, so Fine infiltrates her home. However, Rayna shoots Fine dead, while Susan watches helplessly online, then reveals that she knows the identities of the agency's top agents, including Rick Ford and Karen Walker. Susan, who is almost certainly unknown to Rayna, volunteers to track her (she was a top trainee agent, albeit over ten years ago). When her boss, Elaine Crocker, reluctantly agrees, the ultra [[Machismo|macho]] Ford quits in disgust.  With her best friend Nancy providing intelligence, Susan goes to [[Paris]] undercover. That night, Ford shows up and tells Susan she will fail because of her inexperience. The next morning, Susan discovers that De Luca's office has burned down. She finds a photo of a man standing next to the fire. Ford appears, argues with Susan again and leaves. Susan sees the man in the photo follow him and switch his backpack with another one containing a bomb while Ford is distracted. Susan warns Ford in time during a [[Verka Serduchka]] concert and then pursues the man into an abandoned building. During the ensuing fight, he falls to his death. When she checks the man's video camera, Susan learns that De Luca is going to Rome.  In Rome, Susan meets her contact Aldo. She follows Sergio into a casino (in a city without casino), where she saves Rayna's life. Rayna brings Susan into her inner circle and takes Susan on her private plane to [[Budapest]]. In mid-flight, the steward kills Rayna's bodyguard and pilots, but Susan subdues him. Rayna believes Susan to be a CIA agent, but Susan convinces her that she was hired by her father to protect Rayna.  In Budapest, Susan meets Nancy, who was sent by Crocker. After being shot at, Susan pursues and catches up with the would-be assassin: Karen, who sold Rayna the names of the other agents. She tries to shoot Susan, but an unknown sniper kills her. Susan, Nancy and Aldo accompany Rayna to a party to meet Rayna's contact. That turns out to be Lia, the woman who distracted Ford in Paris. Nancy creates a diversion (by pretending to be a crazed fan of guest performer [[50 Cent]]) so that Susan can try to apprehend Lia unnoticed. Because of Ford's inopportune intervention, however, Lia runs off. Susan chases after her. After a brutal fight, as Susan is about to arrest Lia, she is instead killed by Fine, who earlier faked his death and is now Rayna's lover and associate.  Rayna imprisons Susan and Aldo in a bunker. Later, Fine reveals to Susan that he is trying to gain Rayna's trust to locate the nuke, and he was the one who killed Karen. Susan and Aldo escape.  At De Luca's mansion, Fine, Rayna and Sergio wait for Solsa Dudaev, head of an al-Qaeda-funded terrorist group. Susan convinces Rayna and  De Luca that, even though she works for the CIA, she will do anything to protect Fine, admitting that she loves him. Dudaev gives De Luca a suitcase full of diamonds, and Rayna produces the device. De Luca has Dudaev and his men killed, then reveals his plan to sell the device to another buyer (though they also intend to bomb [[New York City]]), before pointing his gun at Rayna. Ford distracts him, allowing Susan to  kill his men. Sergio escapes to his helicopter with the device and the diamonds, but Susan grabs onto the landing gear. In the ensuing struggle, Susan throws the diamonds and the device into a lake below. De Luca attempts to shoot Susan, but Nancy, following in another helicopter, shoots him in the back before he can. He grabs on to Susan's necklace (a gift from Fine), but she releases the catch and De Luca falls out of the helicopter to his death.  The nuke is retrieved by the CIA, and Rayna is arrested. Ford, to Susan's surprise, compliments her on her job. Crocker tells Susan that she will remain a field agent, and that her next assignment will take her to Prague to infiltrate a drug smuggling ring. Fine invites Susan to dinner, but she instead opts for a night out with Nancy.  The next morning, Susan wakes up in bed next to Ford and screams, while Ford claims she "loved it".  
Spotlight (film)
 In 1976, at a [[Boston Police Department|Boston Police]] station, two policemen discuss the arrest of [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]] Fr. [[John Geoghan]] for [[child molestation]] and a [[Monsignor|high ranking cleric]] talks to the mother of the children. The [[District attorney#Assistant District Attorney|Assistant District Attorney]] then enters the precinct and tells the policemen not to let the press get wind of what has happened. The arrest is hushed up, and the priest is released.  In 2001, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' hires a new editor, [[Martin Baron|Marty Baron]]. Baron meets [[Walter V. Robinson|Walter "Robby" Robinson]], the editor of the newspaper's "Spotlight" team, a small group of journalists writing [[Investigative journalism|investigative articles]] that take months to research and publish. After Baron reads a ''Globe'' column about a lawyer, [[Mitchell Garabedian]], who says that [[Bernard Francis Law|Cardinal Bernard Law]] (the [[Archbishop of Boston]]) knew that [[John Geoghan]] was sexually abusing children and did nothing to stop him, he urges the Spotlight team to investigate. Journalist [[Michael Rezendes]] contacts Garabedian, who initially declines to be interviewed. Though he is told not to, Rezendes reveals that he is on the Spotlight team, persuading Garabedian to talk.  Initially believing that they are following the story of one priest who was moved around several times, the Spotlight team begin to uncover a pattern of sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests in [[Massachusetts]], and an ongoing cover-up by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston|Boston Archdiocese]]. Through Phil Saviano, who heads the victims' rights group [[Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests]] (SNAP), they widen their search to 13 priests. They learn through [[Richard Sipe]], a former priest who worked at trying to rehabilitate [[pedophile]] priests, that according to his experience over decades, fifty per cent of priests are not celibate, though most are in relationships with other adults. He also surprises the journalists that his findings would suggest their estimate of the numbers of paedophile priests is low, and that there should be approximately 90 abusive priests in Boston (six percent of priests). Through their research, they develop a list of 87 names, and begin to find their victims to back up their suspicions.  When the [[September 11 attacks]] occur, the team is forced to de-prioritize the story. They regain momentum when Rezendes learns from Garabedian that there are publicly available documents that confirm Cardinal Law was made aware of the problem and ignored it. Although Rezendes argues vociferously to run the story immediately before more victims suffer and rival newspapers publish, Robinson remains steadfast to research further so that the systemic problem can be more fully exposed. After the ''Boston Globe'' wins a case to have even more legal documents unsealed that provide the evidence of that larger picture, the Spotlight team finally begins to write the story, and plan to publish their findings in early 2002.  As they are about to go to print, Robinson confesses to the team that he was sent a list of 20 pedophile priests by lawyer [[Eric MacLeish]] in 1993, which he never followed up on. But Baron still commends him and his team's efforts to expose the crimes now. The story goes to print with a web link to the documents that expose Cardinal Law's inaction and a phone number for victims of pedophile priests. The following morning, the Spotlight team finds itself inundated with phone calls from victims coming forward to tell their stories.  A textual epilogue notes that Cardinal Law resigned in December 2002 and was eventually promoted to the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] in [[Rome]] before presenting a list of places in the United States and around the world where major scandals involving abuse by priests took place.

Star Wars: The Force Awakens
  Thirty years after the [[Galactic Civil War]], the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]] has risen from the fallen [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] and seeks to eliminate the [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]]. The Resistance, backed by the Republic and led by [[Princess Leia|General Leia Organa]], opposes them while Leia searches for her brother, [[Luke Skywalker]].  On the planet [[Jakku]], Resistance pilot [[Poe Dameron]] receives a map to Luke's location from village elder Lor San Tekka. [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Stormtroopers]] commanded by [[Kylo Ren]] destroy the village and capture Poe, while Kylo kills San Tekka. Poe's droid [[BB-8]] escapes with the map and encounters a scavenger, [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]], near a junkyard settlement. Kylo tortures Poe using [[the Force]] and learns of BB-8. Stormtrooper FN-2187, unwilling to kill for the First Order, frees Poe, and they escape in a stolen [[TIE fighter]]; Poe names FN-2187 "[[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]]". As they turn back towards Jakku to retrieve BB-8, they are shot down by a First Order [[Star Destroyer]] and crash land on the planet. Finn survives and assumes Poe died in the crash. Finn encounters Rey and BB-8, but the First Order tracks them and launches an airstrike. Finn, Rey, and BB-8 flee the planet in the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', which they steal from a junkyard.  The ''Falcon'' is captured by a larger ship piloted by [[Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca]], looking to reclaim their former vessel. They are attacked by gangs seeking to settle debts with Han, and flee in the ''Falcon''. The gangs inform the First Order. At the First Order's Starkiller Base, a planet converted into a superweapon that harnesses star energy, [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] allows [[General Hux]] to use the weapon for the first time. Snoke questions Kylo's ability to deal with emotions relating to his father, Han Solo; Kylo says Han means nothing to him.  The ''Falcon'' crew determines BB-8's map is incomplete. Han explains that Luke attempted to rebuild the [[Jedi|Jedi Order]] but exiled himself when an apprentice turned to the dark side, destroyed the temple, and slaughtered the other apprentices. The crew travels to the planet [[Takodana]] and meets with cantina owner [[Maz Kanata]], who offers assistance getting BB-8 to the Resistance. Rey is drawn to a secluded vault and finds the [[lightsaber]] that once belonged to Luke and his father, [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]]. She experiences disturbing visions and flees into the woods. Maz gives Finn the lightsaber for safekeeping.  Starkiller Base fires and destroys the Republic capital star system and a portion of its fleet. The First Order attacks Takodana in search of BB-8. Han, Chewbacca, and Finn are saved by Resistance [[X-wing fighter]]s led by Poe, who survived the crash on Jakku. Leia arrives at Takodana with [[C-3PO]] and reunites with Han and Chewbacca. Meanwhile, Kylo captures Rey and takes her to Starkiller Base, but she resists his mind-reading attempts. Discovering she can use the Force, Rey escapes by using a [[Jedi mind trick]] on a nearby guard.  At the Resistance base on [[D'Qar]], BB-8 finds [[R2-D2]], who has been inactive since Luke's disappearance. As Starkiller Base prepares to fire on D'Qar, the Resistance devises a plan to destroy it by attacking a critical facility. Using the ''Falcon'', Han, Chewbacca, and Finn infiltrate the facility, find Rey, and plant explosives. Han confronts Kylo, calling him by his birth name, Ben, and implores him to abandon the dark side. Kylo refuses and kills Han, enraging Chewbacca, who shoots Kylo and sets off the explosives, allowing the Resistance to attack and destroy Starkiller Base.  The injured Kylo pursues Finn and Rey to the surface. Kylo defeats Finn in a lightsaber duel and leaves him badly wounded. Rey takes the lightsaber and uses the Force to defeat Kylo, before they are separated by a fissure as the planet begins to disintegrate. Snoke orders Hux to evacuate and bring Kylo to him to complete his training. Rey and Chewbacca escape with the unconscious Finn in the ''Falcon''. On D'Qar, the Resistance celebrates while Leia, Chewbacca, and Rey mourn Han's death. R2-D2 awakens and reveals the rest of the map, which Rey follows to the oceanic planet Ahch-To. She finds Luke and presents him with the lightsaber.  
Srimanthudu
 Harsha Vardhan is the sole heir of his father Ravikanth's business empire worth 250 billion. After he meets Charuseela at his friend Apparao's birthday party, he enrolls in a university course on rural development. Charuseela wants to use technology for the benefit of Devarakota, a remote village in [[Uttarandhra]] from which she hails. A friendship blossoms between them, and as time passes they become attracted to each other.  The natural resources of Devarakota are being exploited by Sashi, the brother of central minister Venkata Ratnam, whose tyranny has made many locals migrate to the city to seek a better life. Nevertheless, the village head Narayana Rao hopes that the standard of living will soon improve along with the general condition of the village. Meanwhile, Ratnam's son Radha uses blackmail to threaten harm to Ravikanth's family if he does not back out of a prestigious highway contract. Ravikanth's nephew Karthik, who hopes to succeed Ravikanth in the business empire, leaks to Radha details about an upcoming bid for the contract, which comes to the notice of Harsha. After subtly warning Ratnam at his residence in Delhi, Harsha secretly makes a lower bid on behalf of his father's company and wins the contract.  When Charuseela learns that Harsha is Ravikanth's son, she starts avoiding him. When he asks the reason, she says that Ravikanth is a native of Devarakota who left for Hyderabad to earn wealth unlike her father Narayana Rao, and she bids farewell. After asking his father for a long holiday before joining the office, Harsha travels to Devarakota without his father's knowledge. In Devarakota he meets Rao and introduces himself as a student pursuing a course in rural development who has come to study the village.  After learning more about Devarakota and Sashi's tyranny, Harsha announces that he will adopt the village and develop it. While he works to improve conditions in the village, Ratnam asks Sashi also to develop the village, partly to win in the upcoming elections, but he remains silent regarding his intention to gain credit for doing so. At the same time, Harsha comes to know from Rao that, as a young man, Ravikanth, wishing, as Harsha does now, to see the village developed, established a dairy farm for the locals' welfare. After the farm was set up, Ratnam and Sashi set it on fire, causing the death of many, and Ravikanth was blamed for the fire, insulted, and arrested. He walked out of the village, moved to the city, and went on to acquire much wealth.  Charuseela returns to Devarakota and assumes that Harsha is trying to impress her family with the intention of marrying her. Initially livid, Charuseela is impressed when Harsha succeeds in persuading her uncle's family not to migrate to the city to live with their employed son and instead makes their son agree to visit them every possible weekend. Later, Harsha and Charuseela learn that Ratnam is going to take over all the agricultural land around the village for political gain since the value of the land will appreciate following the official declaration of a new coastal industrial corridor. Harsha confronts them and warns them not to interfere in his work of developing the village.  Harsha later visits a water bottling unit which not only produces alcoholic beverages but also draws from the village's source of drinking water. He tries to close it, but is attacked by Sashi's henchmen and is hospitalised. Ravikanth, who has been informed of Harsha's adoption of Devarakota, manages to bring Harsha back to Hyderabad, where he joins the office after he recovers. Ravikanth later confronts a visibly upset Harsha and decides to send him back to Devarakota, earning Harsha's love, for which he has long yearned. Harsha hands over the reigns of the business empire to Karthik and leaves.  At Devarakota, Harsha kills Ratnam and Sashi at the factory and construes it as an accident due to an inadvertent short-circuit, similar to what Sashi had done before Ravikanth's arrest years before. The film ends with Ravikanth and his family visiting Rao's house on [[Sankranthi]], where Harsha, now Charuseela's husband, receives them warmly.

One year later, Tim and his girlfriend Martha are on a roadtrip with James to [[La Push]], Washington. Tim is hoping the trip to the beach will help James with his PTSD. They stop at a mysterious biker's house named Seth Guardrail Slaughter ([[Russell Hodgkinson]]) to get a map that will lead them to a legendary strain of extra-terrestrial cannabis growing in the Olympic Mountains.  The trio use the map to navigate their way towards finding the "Garden of Weeden". Eventually, they find the ET marijuana, and Martha proceeds to violate the first rule of the grove - no cell phone usage that could give away the GPS coordinates of the sacred stash.  Around a campfire they begin to smoke the Star Leaf and experience a wide range of hallucinations and visions. James starts to hear voices - Afghan voices as his PTSD begins to manifest violently. Then, a UFO flies overhead. The group cannot tell if these things are real, or just side effects of smoking Star Leaf. To their shock, a forest ranger named Ranger Dave (Richard Cranor) suddenly enters their campsite as well. Joining them around the campfire, Ranger Dave proceeds to give an awkward and mysterious oral history of the Star Leaf, and what its spiritual effects are on those who smoke it.   Later that night, James is woken by mysterious orbs floating inside his tent. Along with the rest of the group, they experience multiple alien encounters that force them to flee the campsite. Soon it's discovered that Tim has stolen some Star Leaf clippings, a major violation of the rules governing the Star Leaf grove, and the reason behind the growing alien interference.  The group is split up - escaping into the woods James suffers multiple PTSD flashbacks. Ranger Dave and Seth Guardrail Slaughter intervene on his behalf, offering him an opportunity to redeem himself and his friends if he's willing to return Tim's stolen Star Leaf back to the grove, despite the Alien threat. James rises to the occasion, facing his most troubling fears and returns the Star Leaf successfully, allowing him to process fully his PTSD experience in Afghanistan and leading to much needed healing for himself and Tim.  The film ends with the group finally making it to the beach and surfing the ocean waves.  
Steve Jobs (film)
 In 1984, the [[Macintosh 128K|Apple Macintosh 128K]]'s voice demo fails less than an hour before its unveiling at [[De Anza College|Flint Center]]. [[Apple, Inc.|Apple]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]] demands engineer [[Andy Hertzfeld]] fix it, threatening to publicly implicate him in the presentation's credits if he does not. Hertzfeld finally suggests faking the demo using the prototype [[Macintosh 512K]] computer.  Jobs rants to marketing executive [[Joanna Hoffman]] about a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article exposing his paternity dispute with ex-girlfriend [[Chrisann Brennan]] – he denies he is the father of Brennan's five-year-old daughter, [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs|Lisa]]. Brennan arrives with Lisa to confront him – she is bitter over his denials and his refusal to support her despite his wealth. Jobs bonds with Lisa over her [[MacPaint]] art and agrees to provide more money and a house. Apple co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]] asks Jobs to acknowledge the [[Apple II]] team in his presentation, but Jobs feels that mentioning the computer (which he considers obsolete) is unwise.  By 1988, following the apparent failure of the Macintosh, Jobs has founded a new company, [[NeXT]]. Before the [[NeXT Computer]] launch at the [[War Memorial Opera House]], he spends time with 9-year-old Lisa, but his relationship with Brennan is still strained – he accuses her of irresponsible behavior and of using Lisa to get money from him. Wozniak arrives and predicts the NeXT will be another failure. Jobs confronts him about his public criticism of him, and Wozniak questions Jobs' contributions to computing history. Jobs defends his role as that of a conductor, who directs "musicians" like Wozniak.  Apple CEO [[John Sculley]] demands to know why the world believes he fired Jobs – Jobs was actually forced out by the Apple board, who were resolute on updating the Apple II following the Macintosh's lackluster sales. Jobs lambasted the decision and dared them to cast a final vote on his tenure, despite Sculley's warnings. After Hoffman and Jobs discuss NeXT's unclear direction, she realizes that Jobs has designed the computer to entice Apple to buy the company and reinstate him.  By 1998, Apple has fired Sculley, purchased NeXT, and named Jobs CEO, and Jobs is about to unveil the [[iMac G3|iMac]] at [[Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall|Davies Symphony Hall]]. He is delighted by Hoffman's strong commercial forecasts, but furious that Lisa has allowed her mother to sell the house Jobs bought for them. Hoffman reminds Jobs that he threatened to withhold Lisa's college tuition – Hertzfeld admits that he paid Lisa's tuition and suggested she attend therapy. Wozniak again asks that Jobs credit the Apple II team during the presentation, and again he refuses.  Sculley arrives in secret and the two make amends. Jobs and Sculley discuss Jobs' life as an adopted child, and Jobs admits that his need for control stems from his feelings of powerlessness in being given up. At the behest of Hoffman, Jobs apologizes to Lisa for his mistakes and accepts that he is her father, admitting that he is "poorly made". Lisa watches her father take the stage to introduce the iMac.

Her best friend Sunny, an elf who has a crush on Dawn, tries to cheer her up with a song, but they are nearly devoured by a giant lizard before a hardened Marianne rescues them. Sunny, having fallen through the border of the dark forest, finds a Primrose petal, which he subsequently hides when fleeing the forest.  At the ball, Roland tries to assert his intention to marry Marianne, who refuses and humiliates him out of the dance. He encounters Sunny and tricks him into returning to the dark forest to convince the Sugar Plum Fairy, who had been captured years ago by the Bog King, to create the love potion. Sunny acquires the petal he had hidden and with the help of a curious imp, ventures into Bog's castle, eventually finding the fairy and promising to free her in exchange for the love potion.  Their escape rouses Bog, who manages to recapture the Sugar Plum Fairy while Sunny escapes, followed by the imp, and Bog is enraged when he learns that Sunny has a vial of love potion. Sunny returns to the ball and tries to hit Dawn with the love potion during his musical number. Bog interrupts the celebrations and captures Dawn just as she is sprayed by the love potion and the imp steals it in order to spread it throughout the forest. Bog orders them to deliver the potion to him by moondown or he would harm Dawn. Defying her father's order, Marianne flies off after her sister while he grants Roland a small army to head off on foot to Bog's castle.  Meanwhile, Dawn falls in love with him due to the potion, and Bog has her imprisoned for his own sanity. Marianne arrives and fights with Bog to return her sister. When she realizes the severity of the situation, the two of them begin to find common interests. When they consult the Sugar Plum Fairy for an antidote, she explains that true love will negate the effects of the potion, recounting a time where Bog fell in love with another female in the forest who left him despite his use of the love potion on her, as she was in love with someone else at the time he used the potion on her. A mutual attraction begins to develop between Marianne and Bog, but it is only Bog's mother who sees it.  Sunny recovers the potion from the imp and gives it to Roland as they march on to the castle. Bog sees this and suspects that Marianne had set him up, breaking his heart again as he leaves her stranded in a spider web. She escapes and joins in the battle taking place at the castle. Sunny frees the Sugar Plum Fairy, Dawn, and (at the Sugar Plum Fairy's insistence) the love-stricken forest creatures that the imp had hit with the love potion.  In the escape, Bog seemingly sacrifices himself by holding the mouth of his den open long enough for everyone to escape. He survives, to Marianne's relief, and Sunny reveals his true feelings to Dawn, who then reciprocates them, breaking the love potion's spell over her and they kiss, to her father's surprise. Roland sprays Marianne with the love potion, who pretends to fall in love with him, only to suddenly punch him and send him off the chasm, being hit by the love potion in the process.  Marianne and Bog, at the insistence of Dawn and his mother, finally admit their feelings for each other and kiss.

Strangerland
 Catherine and Matthew Parker move with their children Lily and Tom to the remote Australian desert town of Nathgari.  Although the family is unhappy with the move, Matthew and Tom blame Lily for forcing them to leave the larger town of Coonaburra.  When he can't sleep, Tom sometimes walks around the neighbourhood at night, an activity his parents discourage.  One night, Matthew sees Tom leave the house, followed by Lily.  He says nothing and goes back to sleep.  Catherine oversleeps, and when she cannot find the kids, calls Matthew at work.  He reassures her that they must have gone to school before she woke up.  When the school calls to report that Tom and Lily have not been attending, she once again becomes worried, as a [[dust storm]] is scheduled to hit the town.  Matthew discourages her from contacting anyone, as he does not wish the family's business to once again become public knowledge.  Against his wishes, Catherine contacts several people and finally the police.  While taking their report, Detective David Rae finds that Lily has once before been reported missing. Catherine and Matthew reluctantly reveal that she had disappeared for a few days and turned up at a friend's house.  After further investigation, Rae learns that one of Lily's Coonaburra teachers, Neil McPherson, had sex with her. When Matthew found out, he beat up McPherson. The Parkers admit to Rae that they left Coonaburra to escape the attention.  Catherine becomes frustrated with Matthew's focus on his job as a pharmacist, though he insists that he has no choice, since the community needs his services.  Rae's queries in town reveal that Lily had multiple sexual relationships despite being underage.  When Catherine finds Lily's diary, it includes pictures and poetry about several people: McPherson, the Parker's mentally handicapped handyman Burtie, and a local youth nicknamed Slug.  It also describes her parents' marriage as a sham, which causes Catherine to cry.  Catherine hands the diary to Rae with the proviso that he not reveal it to Matthew.  Matthew drives to Coonaburra and threatens McPherson.  Coreen, Rae's girlfriend and Burtie's sister, becomes annoyed when Rae won't share details of the case with her.  Rae secretly shreds the evidence that connects Burtie to Lily and discourages Burtie from telling him anything incriminating.  Rae arrests Slug, but without any evidence must release him.  When the kids remain missing, the town organises a search party.  Matthew refuses to participate, further angering Catherine.  Rae suggests to Catherine that her children could have run away for a reason.  Catherine confronts Matthew with Lily's sexual history and asks if he molested her.  Incredulous, he denies it and asks why she would even ask; she cites his apparent reluctance to help find the kids.  Knowing now that Burtie had a sexual relationship with Lily, Matthew beats up Burtie and searches his house.  Coreen demands Rae arrest Matthew, and when she accuses him of taking the Parkers' side, Rae reveals Burtie's connection.  Burtie visits the Parkers and asks to speak with Matthew.  Catherine invites him in, but he leaves when she attempts to seduce him in Lily's clothes.  When Matthew drives into the desert alone, he finds Tom dehydrated and delirious.  Tom initially refuses to speak, and Catherine yells at him; Tom eventually tells Matthew that he saw Lily get into a car.  Catherine listens as locals discuss Lily's disappearance and likely death, and becomes distraught when she receives prank calls that call Lily promiscuous.  She visits Rae, and when she fails to seduce him, wanders into the desert alone.  She later reappears in town, naked.  In bed together, as they hold each other, Catherine admits that she hid the diary from Matthew, and Matthew admits he saw the kids leave at night.  He says he did not stop them because he wanted to punish Lily.  Catherine hugs Tom and walks onto the porch, where she and Matthew console each other.  While holding Lily's diary, Matthew cries and says that he wishes he could take back that moment.

Suburra (film)
  In 2011, Filippo Malgradi is an Italian MP who is currently involved in a bill to change the classification of certain administrative areas; his objective is to allow a real estate project in [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]] so that it could be turned into a [[Las Vegas]]-like city. He has close relations with a local crime boss—known as "Samurai", a former [[Right-wing terrorism#Italy|right-wing terrorist]] turned criminal under the cover of an unsuspecting pump station owner—who also has very deep interests in the real estate project. Samurai has privileged ties to the [[Vatican Bank]], who will finance the project and profit immensely from it.  One evening, Filippo goes into a hotel room with two prostitutes, Sabrina and Jelena, who is underage, to engage in a "sex and drugs" party. Jelena dies from intoxication, and Filippo and Sabrina have to dispose of the body. Filippo runs away, and Sabrina calls a Gypsy friend, Alberto Anacleti, known as Dagger, to help her get rid of the body. They decide to throw Jelena's corpse into an artificial lake.  Dagger originates from a Gypsy family who made a fortune by violent means as money lenders and debt collectors. They lent money to the father of Sebastiano, an upper class pimp who is a close friend of the prostitute Sabrina and who organises secret parties in his family villa for important members of the Italian high society. Sebastiano's father commits suicide after being unable to pay his debts, and Manfredi Anacleti, the patriarch of the Anacleti family, summons Sebastiano to convince him to relinquish all his property to pay for his father's debts.  Dagger decides to blackmail Filippo into purchasing drugs and prostitutes from him and his family, threatening to reveal everything he knows. Filippo asks a member of the party to put Dagger in his place; the MP asks Aureliano Adami (known as Number 8) to teach Dagger a lesson but the confrontation ends up being more violent than expected and Aureliano kills Dagger leaving Manfredi Anacleti infuriated and thirsty for revenge.  Aureliano is a local thug who controls the target of the real estate project permitted by the bill in discussion. His father was also a criminal and a close friend of Samurai although his means were much less violent. He has agreed with Samurai a division in profits as long as Aureliano convinces – by violent means – local small business owners to sell their properties at a bargain to Samurai. Aureliano Adami is in love with a drug-addict named Viola.  Filippo and Sabrina make a pact of silence over what happened that night and Sabrina, fearful that the Anacleti or the Judiciary may get to her, asks her pimp Sebastiano for help. Sebastiano lets her stay in her place and hears her confession. He then decides to reveal the identity of Dagger's murderer to Manfredi in exchange for his family's villa.  Anacleti's henchman attempt unsuccessfully to kill Aureliano. Fearful that an all-out war between Aureliano Adami and Manfredi Anacleti could threaten his real estate interests, Samurai decides to intervene between the two to bring about some peace. In the meantime Manfredi learns about the real estate project and also wants his share in the business.  Manfredi blackmails Sebastiano to hand him over the prostitute Sabrina; in turn, Sabrina tells Manfredi Anacleti the name of the politician who is behind the project, which she reveals to be Filippo Malgradi. Manfredi bursts into Filippo's apartment and takes his son as a hostage, demanding a participation in the business. Filippo, in a rage, asks Samurai for protection. Samurai, who does not want to lose the transaction, attempts to reason with Aureliano but he tells Samurai that he is old and outdated. Samurai, offended by Aureliano's words and also fearful that the Vatican would back down on financing the project, decides to kill him and his henchmen. During the shooting, the drug-addict Viola hides and manages to escape. He decides to share the profits only with Manfredi Anacleti.  In the meantime Manfredi turns greedy and goes back on his promise to return the family villa to Sebastiano, severely beating Sebastiano as a lesson and intimidation. The bill is also approved, the Vatican provides financing and everything seems to be in motion to provide Filippo, Manfredi and Samurai with their millions.  The body of Jelena is found in the banks of the river. Filippo is warned that the Judiciary may investigate him, but he is not worried since he has immunity as a member of Parliament. Meanwhile, Sebastiano, in a fit of rage, assaults Manfredi when he arrives home at night, and beats him severely. He then leaves the patriarch of the family to the rage of Manfredi's own ferocious pit bull.  After the approval of the bill, the Italian Prime Minister resigns from office, which jeopardizes Filippo's parliamentary immunity, potentially leaving him at the mercy of the Judiciary. Finally, Samurai is killed while leaving his mother's apartment by Viola, Aureliano's girlfriend.

Super Hero Taisen GP: Kamen Rider 3
   Rain falls on February 10, 1973, the date that the defeat of Shocker by the hands of Kamen Riders 1 and 2 was aired on television, as depicted by a television in a junkyard, which is struck by green lightning. Riders 1 and 2 ride off with their painful struggle seemingly at an end, but they are attacked by a car mounted with machine guns and adorned with the Tachibana Racing Club. It turns out that the vehicle is manned by another Kamen Rider who identifies himself as Kamen Rider 3, who was designed to destroy Riders 1 and 2. They do battle, but Rider 3 is able to take on both of them easily by himself. Riders 1 and 2 use their Rider Double Kick, but Rider 3's own Rider Kick destroys Riders 1 and 2, and a green shockwave covers the land.  Near present time, at the Special Investigations Division, who work on police cases involving monsters, Chief Jun Honganji wonders where Kiriko Shijima and Shinnosuke Tomari are at. Rinna Sawagami says they are at the crime scene right now. Kamen Rider Drive is doing battle with Roidmude 102. Kamen Rider Drive equips Midnight Shadow, and performs its Full Throttle finisher, destroying 102's core, and un-transforms. As Kiriko and Shinnosuke revel in their victory, a green shockwave spans the city, with Signal Legend Faiz going into Kiriko's Shift Car Holder. Suddenly, everything appears to be Shocker themed, including Shinnosuke and Kiriko's attire, which Kiriko finds odd. Even stranger to her, Shinnosuke does not acknowledge the change, behaving as though this is normal. Kiriko becomes aware she is the only person who observed the change. Shocker soldiers patrol the streets while Shocker Combatmen demonstrate by marching in the street with Shocker flags, as the citizens bow their heads while they pass. A man and child protesting against Shocker try to break up the demonstration, tossing flyers about the Kamen Riders being heroes as they are arrested. Kiriko explains in commentary that Kamen Riders are known as demons that threaten the peace and safety of the people, as the child calls out towards the protester who is his dad, and they are taken separate directions by Shocker soldiers. Now, the Special Investigations Division works on police cases related to Kamen Riders.  Children are seen in a race competition which is to determine which child has the best affinity with machines to enter the Shocker Youth, the winners being indoctrinated by General Black. The selected children will be turned into cyborgs. Kotaro Minami, wearing black, announces his presence. Three officers become Zanjioh, Kame Bazooka, and Schwarian, and Kotaro transforms into Kamen Rider Black in order to fight Shocker and free the children. In the fight, Black destroys Kame Bazooka with his Rider Kick. Kamen Rider Drive appears at the scene to defeat Black. Kiriko laments the crime that is the world itself, knowing being a Rider should not be punished, let alone by another Rider, Drive, who works for Shocker. Kiriko then realizes that Black has the right memories. The Great Leader of Shocker's voice tells General Black to attack the children to distract Black, and Schwarian attacks for him, which Black blocks, un-transforming him. General Black taunts Kotaro, who gets up and claims he will always defend the children's smiles. General Black tells Drive to finish Kotaro off, but Drive hesitates because he cannot find it in him to attack children. Suddenly, Kamen Rider 3 attacks the scene, Drive avoids the attack with Type Speed, and Rider 3 challenges him to a fight away from here. Drive pursues him and is attacked by Schwarian. Kiriko arrests Kotaro.  Rider 3 seemingly tries to race Drive there. He causes Drive to spin out and then gets out of his car. He tells Drive he is just a Shocker lap dog and that he is not worth fighting. Krim tells Shinnosuke that Kiriko has disappeared with Kotaro. Shinnosuke arrives at the pit and accuses Kiriko of harboring a fugitive. Kotaro tells Shinnosuke about Kamen Riders 1 and 2 who were assassinated fighting against Shocker, and that the other Riders who followed in their footsteps were turned into Shocker Riders, but righteousness had awakened Black from his state as a Shocker Rider. As Shinnosuke thinks about it, they are attacked by Girizames and some Combatmen ordered by him, Shinnosuke and Kotaro fight them un-transformed. Shinnosuke is hurt badly but Kotaro lets him escape, and tells him he can be the light of hope as a Kamen Rider. Shinnosuke destroys some Combatmen with Tridoron's machine guns and Kotaro is seemingly killed by the Shocker monsters.  Officer Genpachiro Otta is shocked that they were betrayed by Shinnosuke, but Honganji defends him. Honganji is found by Shinnosuke and Kiriko tossed out the window of the Special Investigations Division. He reveals to Shinnosuke as he dies in his arms that he believes Kamen Riders are the hope of the world as well. Genpachiro transforms into Cheetahkatatsumuri to challenge Shinnosuke. Shinnosuke, enraged by the death of his chief, is reminded by Kiriko he can defend hope because he is a Kamen Rider. He equips the Drive Driver and Krim says Shinnosuke is finally up to speed. Shinnosuke transforms into Drive and proclaims himself a Kamen Rider. Cheetahkatatsumuri tells the other officers to get Kiriko and Kiriko runs. Cheetahkatatsumuri traps Drive in his snail goo, and Drive uses the Door-Ju to attack, but Cheetahkatatsumuri is too fast. Drive escapes the goo by being attacked. As Drive tries to resist further, Kiriko is shown to be hostage atop the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Building. Kiriko tells Drive he is the only person who can revert this messed up world and is seemingly thrown from the building. Drive falls to his knees in despair. Kamen Rider 3 appears in his vehicle and rams Cheetahkatatsumuri, and urges Drive to follow him in Tridoron. Rider 3 attacks Cheetahkatatsumuri one more time leaving him unable to pursue.  Shinnosuke and Rider 3 meet un-transformed. He him he prefers his expression now and figures out that he is one of the Riders fighting against Shocker. Rider 3 takes off his sunglasses and reveals that his name is Kyoichiro Kuroi, and that he awoke to justice. Kyoichiro also reveals that Riders 1 and 2 survived by placing their souls into artificial brains. The brains are located in Rider Town, where all the Riders who oppose Shocker gather. Kyoichiro says he wants to join these Riders himself. Shinnosuke observes from a distance the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Building being destroyed. Shinnosuke agrees to join but is attacked by Riderman and Kamen Rider V3. Drive and Rider 3 transform to fight them. Rider 3 and V3 square off with each other while Riderman and Drive fight. Rider 3 and V3 try their Rider Kicks on each other and Rider 3's prevails. Rider 3 humiliates V3 even further by knocking him down, taunting him. He takes it upon himself to take our Riderman too, and taunts him for calling himself Rider 4. They are than attacked by Kamen Rider Stronger's Electric Chop, who is followed by Kamen Rider X and Kamen Rider Amazon. Kamen Rider Mach shows up to lend a hand facing the Shocker Riders. Mach takes out Amazon and Stronger, and Drive along with Mach find Rider 3 mercilessly beating X while down. Rider 3 believes he has only won if he has completely beaten his opponent into submission, but Drive gets him to stop by reminding him that he will kill X if he continues. Rider 3 has a flashback to when he killed Kamen Riders 1 and 2, and leaves X alone. Drive, Mach, and Rider 3 leave in their vehicles toward Rider Town, however, they are being watched by Yuto Sakurai.  The Riders discuss their position on things around a campfire. Shinnousuke suggests Kyoichiro is too obsessed with winning. Kyoichiro says that history is decided by the victor, so what is right is also decided by victory. He flashes back to when he killed Riders 1 and 2 again. They hear a rumbling in the trees as they are attacked by Kamen Rider J, a giant capable of taking them all on easily by himself. Shinnosuke gets into Tridoron and turns it into Type Wild. He assaults J but Yuto on the ZeroLiner stops him. Yuto introduces himself and tells Shinnosuke and Mach who Rider 3 really is, the Rider who killed Riders 1 and 2 injected into history by Shocker. Yuto says he doesn't trust Rider 3, and asks Shinnosuke where he stands. He cannot decide, and separates from the group to take sometime to fully recover, and investigate the truth behind the new timeline they are in on his own, without being spotted by Shocker.  Kamen Rider Chalice attacks Kamen Rider Garren, un-transforming him into Sakuya Tachibana. As Sakuya is held by combatants, Chalice threatens to turn him back into a Shocker Rider. The Kamen Riders save the severely injured Tachibana. He reveals that Chalice and Kamen Rider Leangle are experimenting on undead technology, and that Garren and Blade tried to stop them, but Blade was captured. The Kamen Riders offer to help. Before they leave Kyoichiro calls out Yuto, who is hiding. The Kamen Riders cannot identify him as friend or foe. Kyoichiro allows Yuto to continue to watch. The Kamen Riders storm the Shocker base where Kamen Rider Blade is held, but Chalice appears. Kyoichiro lets the other Riders find Blade, and takes on Chalice himself. The Kamen Riders find Blade held in chains, but when they free Blade he attacks them. Leangle reveals it was a trap all along, and that Blade is a Shocker Rider now, and that Garren was placed to trick them. Kamen Rider 3 appears to even the score. Yuto transforms into Zeronos and Go transforms into Mach, and they do battle with the Shocker Riders. Go defeats Leangle and Chalice with his Zenrin Shooter, Rider 3 defeats Blade with his Rider Kick, and Zeronos defeats Garren with his Full Charge finisher. Zeronos is about to kill Garren but Rider 3 tells him he will always regret it, and explains how he felt when he killed Kamen Riders 1 and 2, and how he'd never forget killing a symbol of hope. Zeronos un-transforms, and saves Kyoichiro from being assaulted by Takumi Inui, whom Kyoichiro identifies as Kamen Rider Faiz. Mach attacks Takumi after Yuto refuses, claiming to not want to help cause he fights for himself, and they escape.  Kyu Saijo and Rinna walk through town in gaudy disguises. They are called by Shinnosuke. Kyu almost blows their cover when he is excited to hear from him. Shinnosuke wants him to look some things up about Kamen Rider 3. He wants Kyu to hack into Shocker's database to find out. Rinna keeps Kyu from blowing their cover again. Rinna inquires to the whereabouts of Kiriko. The Kamen Riders find themselves at a tunnel where they are attacked by Takumi again. Takumi transforms into Kamen Rider Faiz, prompting the Kamen Riders to transform as well. Faiz uses Accel Form to increase his speed, so Mach speeds up as well, allowing Rider 3 and Zeronos to escape, only to find Kamen Riders Super-1, ZX, ZO, Skyrider, and Shocker Combatmen. Takumi times out and then surrenders to Mach, and they both un-transform. Takumi says he doesn't care about mankind's freedom and says he is like Rider 3 in that sense. He tells Go that Kamen Rider 3 is a Shocker Rider. Mach is surprised. Rider 3 and Zeronos are also attacked by Kamen Riders Decade, Agito, and Hibiki. Rider 3 offers to take all of them, Zeronos refuses to leave, but Rider 3 attacks Zeronos and tells him to run and not let his sacrifice be in vein. Zeronos fights he way through combatmen and escapes to Rider Town.  Yuto arrives at Rider Town and wonders where all the Riders are. He is led by Riders 1 and 2's voice to the home of Takeshi Hongo, who is the real identity of Kamen Rider 1. He is greeted into the mansion by Tobei Tachibana, who was instructed to be Yuto's guide by Takeshi Hongo. Tobei shows Yuto a secret door that leads to the brains of Kamen Riders 1 and 2. Yuto asks Rider 1 where the other Riders are, but it turns out that he is not really Rider 1 but instead the Great Leader of Shocker, and that this is not really Rider Town but in fact Shocker Town. Tobei transforms into Hiruchameleon. Yuto escapes but the computer that the Great Leader of Shocker is contained on rises from the mansion Hongo once lived in, and all the high ranking Shocker members surround Yuto along with Rider 3 who reveals he led them into a trap, as well as revealing his true origin that he confronted Shocker on purpose, swearing his loyalty to the organization in order to become stronger, instead of being kidnapped and brainwashed. Shinnosuke appears and picks apart their plan. Genpachiro shows that Kiriko is actually alive and now a Shocker hostage. Kiriko urges Shinnosuke not to worry about her. Shinnosuke challenges the Great Leader of Shocker to race their Shocker Riders against him in his Tridoron, and taunts Rider 3 by saying he hasn't beaten him into submission yet. Shocker agrees because they have wanted to see this race for some time. Shinnosuke says they shall release the children and Kiriko if he wins. Shinnosuke and Yuto are kept in cells until the race. Yuto questions Shinnosuke's motivation for his challenge. He says that the purpose of the race is to expose Shocker's true goal.  Shocker Riders 3, Agito, Kabuto, Decade, Double, OOO, Fourze, Wizard, and Gaim are shown with Kamen Rider Drive ready to start the race as the Shocker Riders are cheered by a full crowd of Combatmen, as Yuto and Kiriko are held above the stands on crosses. As Shocker reveals to be always cheating during a race to ensure Drive lost the match without any back up from remaining allies, Wizard tries to destroy the track in front of Drive, but Drive fights off all of Wizard's attacks. Double's RevolGarry and Gaim try to block Rider 3 but he uses tire spikes to destroy both. Mashin Chaser suddenly appears driving next to Drive, taunts him for siding with humans and attempt to kill him. Though lost hope against Shocker's dirty tricks, Kotaro appears wearing white. He transforms into Kamen Rider Black RX and jumps into his car, Ridoron. He says Drive's light gave him hope for his revival and takes out Mashin Chaser. Kabuto tries to stop Drive by using Clock Up and jumping from his bike, but Faiz stops him, justifying himself by saying he is still a Kamen Rider, so he should protect the smiles of children at least. Faiz uses Axel Form's Start Up to face Kabuto on and even playing feel. Mach joins the race and uses Signal Tomarle on the remaining Riders who attempt to sabotage Drive, leaving Rider 3 and Drive racing one-on-one. Rider 3 fires missiles to stop Drive when he maintains the lead for too long. Drive points out that he knows about Rider 3's doubts and how he is lying about being brainwashed. Some of the other racers pass them while Drive speaks. Drive claims his heart remained human, and ask Rider 3 if he felt regret on killing the original Double Riders, Rider 1 and 2 in the past, leading Rider 3 to start to doubt himself. Shinnosuke relays his own doubts to Rider 3. Shinnosuke tells him that they could only prove their self-worth if they proved they were the strongest Rider. Rider 3 punches Drive telling him he must win forever, but Drive says winning and losing doesn't matter, but what you do in the present does. Rider 3 punches Drive again, insisting he must win, and drives off. He destroys the bikes of all the other riders, and Drive catches up in Booster Tridoron after saving the other Shocker Riders from doom, and the children see the difference in the actions of the Shocker Riders and the Kamen Riders, as does the entire world. A child in a crowd cheers for Kamen Riders, and an officer tries to attack the kid to silence him, but the adults fight the officer. Drive Type Formula and Rider 3 are once again very close in the race during the final stretch. They both accelerate to their top speeds while everyone cheers for the Kamen Rider. Drive defeats Rider 3 in the race by the length of his vehicle.  After the race, Drive reverts back to his Type Speed form, and he looks onto Kyoichiro who is holding his helmet, and tells him that losing isn't so bad, because he learned from losing to Rider 3. Kyoichiro still holding onto defeat tells Shinnosuke he will always be Shocker's lapdog for having Rider 1 and 2's blood on his hands, but Shinnosuke tells him he can always still make up for it. The Great Leader of Shocker's brain appears suddenly and absorbs Rider 3, becoming the Kamen Rider shaped Rider Robo, revealing how he changed history. Drive figures out that the race was allowed to happen so that he could absorb the strongest rider. In its high powered state, The Great Leader threatens to erase the concept of Kamen Rider from history. Every Shocker Rider attacks Shinnosuke, who responds by becoming Drive and attacking them all with his Tire Exchanges. As they all battle, Rider Robo assaults all the riders. Meanwhile, the children set free Kiriko and Yuto. Genpachiro tries to stop them by becoming Cheetahkatatsumuri, but Deneb appears and fires them off of the scaffolding. Yuto transforms into Zeronos Zero Form, wielding the Denebick Buster. Blade, Chalice, Garren, and Leangle awaken to justice and fight the Shocker Riders. Black RX, Mach and Faiz join Drive but cannot take on Rider Robo. However, Kamen Riders 1 and 2 will their souls out of the History Modifying Machine, revealing that they lived in its artificial brain secretly, and waited for the moment they would have the chance to defeat Shocker by escaping through exploiting the machine's revival ability. Kamen Riders 1 and 2 awaken justice in all the Kamen Riders. Cheetahkatatsumuri and General Black, who was Hiruchameleon all along, call on Shocker's most powerful members to join the fight, but Kamen Rider J appears to fight Rider Robo himself. Rider Robo erases J from history with its History Erasing Beam, and does this to all the Legendary Riders as well. Kamen Rider 3 awakens to justice and wills himself out of the machine, destroying its capacity to erase things from history. As Rider Robo still has the upper hand, the Nininngers appear suddenly, offering to take care of it for the Riders. They transform, and Drive is astonished by the existence of flashy ninjas. Aka Ninger says they prefer not to hide, and they call on the Otomonin to form Shurikenzin and take on Rider Robo. Mach faces Hiruchameleon and impressively destroys him with seemingly little effort. Cheetahkatatsumuri appears and when Go hesitates, he throws his snail goo on him. Monsters surround him. As Drive is impressed by Shurikenzin, he finds Yoshitaka Igasaki drinking tea, and is shocked that he can drink tea at a time like this. Yoshitaka says the ninjas don't have enough Nintality as they struggle with Rider Robo and creates the Tridoron Nin Shuriken, and disappears. Drive uses the Nin Shuriken on his Handle-Ken to form Shurikenzin Tridoron, which makes Tridoron a part of Shurikenzin, allowing Drive to help pilot it. While the other Riders take out the remaining Shocker members, Mach does not make it, but his death inspires the Riders to fight harder to avenge him. Shurikenzin Tridoron in turn defeats Rider Robo with the Shurikenzin - Tridoron Slash finisher, destroying its hold on history. All the Kamen Riders wish Rider 3 goodbye. In good faith they believe he might still exist somehow, somewhere, some day. Rider 3 disappears, history completely restored, or so it seems.  Shinnosuke looks onto the children, who just determined the results of the race. Yuto shows them that Kyoichiro does exist in this timeline and no longer a Rider anymore, yet is still obsessed with winning. However, they still mourning Go's death as Go had remained dead.

Kate Abbott ([[Milla Jovovich]]) is a [[Diplomatic Security Service]] agent working for the [[Embassy of the United States, London|American Embassy]] in London, who began working in the government after most of her friends were killed in [[9/11]]. While she is implementing new, more stringent rules for visa applications of potential terrorist suspects, most of her team are killed while at a restaurant for the birthday of their superior, Bill Talbot ([[Robert Forster]]). Bill is Johnny's father, and is being blackmailed under threat of Johnny's death. He is delayed attending the party when he returns to his desk to delete records of the visas he has approved for terrorists entering the United States. Kate survives the bombing when she leaves the restaurant to get a last-minute present for Bill.  An investigation into the attack reveals that the bomb has traces of [[chromium]], leading her superior at the embassy, Sam Parker ([[Dylan McDermott]]), to deduce that the perpetrator was the 'Watchmaker' ([[Pierce Brosnan]]), one of the world's most wanted killers, known for his precision work, who detonated a bomb with similar traces in Paris two years earlier. Nobody knows the Watchmaker's appearance, as he has had lots of plastic surgery over the years. Kate's subsequent attempts to find out the cause of the explosion reveal that Bill was being blackmailed to let certain visa applicants through after Johnny's capture, and the man behind the attack was indeed the Watchmaker. Her efforts uncover a plan to detonate another bomb at [[Times Square]] in New York City during the New Year's Eve celebrations.  As she carries out her own investigation, she is attacked by Bill, unintentionally killing him in self-defense. She is later classified, through witnesses and footage, as a suspect for the attacks by the others at the embassy and even the British TV Network, forcing her to sneak back into the embassy to create false passports for herself to follow the Watchmaker to New York, with support from Sam and her friend Sally ([[Frances de la Tour]]), the only two people who believe in her innocence.  Meanwhile, the Watchmaker uses a [[Steyr HS .50]] cal sniper rifle to fire an incendiary round into a sphere filled with explosive gas atop a vacant block of apartments in [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]. The building is devastated. Later, the Watchmaker reveals that he is aware that his client's purpose for the Times Square attack is not terrorism but financial. He intends to bet against the stock market and make millions when the stock market reopens. The Watchmaker demands half the profits, threatening to cancel the attack, and the client agrees.  The Watchmaker leaves for New York. Dr Emil Balan ([[Roger Rees]]), is motivated to avenge his late wife's death when her visa to the U.S. was delayed and she didn't receive emergency medical treatment in time. In New York, he coordinates filling the New Year's Eve ball with explosive gas. The Watchmaker's job is to shoot the sphere and ignite the gas. Balan meets the Watchmaker on top of a high rise a few blocks from Times Square. The Watchmaker kills Balan, removing any connection back to him. Kate deduces the plot and finds the Watchmaker, moments away from triggering the bomb. After a struggle, she manages to throw the Watchmaker off the side of the building. He falls to his death on the stroke of midnight. Her suspicion about Balan is vindicated and her name is cleared. She receives a call from Sam, who has recovered from recent injuries, congratulating her.  
SuperBob
 In 2008, an [[asteroid]] breaks into fragments under [[Jupiter]]'s [[gravity]], with one of the fragments landing in the Peckham district of [[London]] and hitting a man called Robert 'Bob' Kenner; a mild-mannered and socially awkward [[Mail carrier|postman]]. Gaining [[Superman]]-like powers as a result of the meteorite, Bob initially tries to learn how to use his new powers alone - prompting media reports of a 'flying man' - but later hands himself in after an incident involving him crashing into [[the Shard]]. Eventually trained by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in using his powers, Bob (now known as 'SuperBob') becomes the world's first [[superhero]], working for the MOD and the British Government as a '[[Civil service|civil servant]]'.  6 years later, Bob's boss Teresa Ford authorizes the creation of a [[Documentary film|documentary]] to show the public that SuperBob is a 'normal guy', as SuperBob's popularity is mixed with common complaints including his simplistic personality and him needing the people he rescues to sign several forms for the MOD. Bob himself is still living in Peckham with his mandatory security guard Barry and his cleaner Dorris - who also works at the care home where Bob's mother lives and is trying to raise money for a nursery in [[Colombia]]. Bob explains to the camera crew that he gets a day off from work every Tuesday and reveals that he's going out for his first date in 6 years with a [[librarian]] called June.  While shopping for clothes with Dorris for his date, Bob receives an emergency call from Teresa telling him to come in for a meeting; arguing with Dorris after she points out he may miss his date with June. The meeting is a preparation for Bob to shake hands with [[United States|American]] [[Senate|senator]] Bill Jackson, who is in London for the MOD Weapons Summit and who sees SuperBob as a 'dangerous weapon that Britain doesn't have control over' (although this is mostly part of a [[smear campaign]] after America failed to poach Bob from the UK a year previously). However, after talking to June and following Doris' advice, Bob finally stands up to Teresa and leaves to go on his date but is called away to the care home after his mother has an accident, with a misunderstanding causing Bob's mum (who has [[Amnesia|short-term memory loss]]) to think that he and Doris are now dating.

Superfast!
 Undercover police officer Lucas White enters the world of underground [[street racing]] to join a gang of street racers led by Vin Serento to get closer to a [[crime ring]] led by Los Angeles kingpin Juan Carlos de la Sol. The morning after losing a street race, Lucas goes to Vin's garage with a wrecked [[Smart Fortwo#Second generation (Build series W451, 2007–2014)|Smart Fortwo]] and lands a job as a mechanic, despite objections by Vin's friend Curtis. He also develops a relationship with Vin's sister Jordana.  The next day, Lucas and Vin head to a secluded area, where they win a dance audition for de la Sol. The duo drive de la Sol's supercar to a warehouse to meet up with a gang and exchange it for a briefcase of cash, only to discover a bomb inside. They play catch with the gang until the bomb explodes on Vin's face before a shootout ensues. Vin chases after the gang leader while Lucas accidentally guns down Detective Hanover, his superior and the only one aware of his identity as an undercover cop. After the duo flee from the scene, Detective Rock Johnson and Officer Julie Canaro arrive to investigate the shootout. Meanwhile, de la Sol orders a hit on Vin following the double-cross. Back at Serento Garage, Vin and the gang discover a list of de la Sol's illegal activities through a computer in the supercar, to which they set out to steal de la Sol's secret stash of $100 million. For this heist, Vin employs the services of Rapper Cameo, Cool Asian Guy, and Model Turned Actress. At the same time, Jordana reveals to Lucas that she is pregnant with their child. Later, the gang begin their heist, but end up on the wrong street and mistakenly mug a pastor and a nun delivering bingo night money. They regroup and deduce that the secret stash is inside a Big Ass Taco restaurant. They hatch a plan to break into the vault, steal the cash, and flee to an extradition-free country with no casualties involved, except for Curtis. The next morning, Johnson and his squad raid the garage; the facility is empty, but Canaro discovers the gang's plans, which are heavily ignored by Johnson.  At the Big Ass Taco, the gang realize they have been double-crossed by Curtis and engage in a shootout with de la Sol's thugs. At the last minute, Curtis is shot dead by de la Sol's henchman Cesar while protecting Vin. Using the restored Smart and Lucas' [[Toyota Corolla (E140)|Toyota Corolla]], Vin and Lucas tow the whole restaurant away. De la Sol and Cesar chase after them with Johnson and his squad in pursuit. Vin's lesbian girlfriend Michelle hands herself over to Canaro to help the gang get away. Meanwhile, de la Sol kicks Cesar out of his SUV after an argument over the climate control. Johnson kills Cesar in a shootout and stops de la Sol, but the kingpin flees after bribing the detective with a male enhancement kit. Upon hearing an explosion, Johnson heads to the abandoned restaurant and chases after the gang. He nabs Jordana and reveals to her and Vin that Lucas is an undercover cop. Lucas, instead, handcuffs Johnson to the spoiler of Jordana's [[Scion tC#First generation|Scion tC]] and walks away with Vin and Jordana while Johnson struggles to grab his bottle of baby oil on the ground. With the cash stowed in the trunks, Lucas and Vin agree to one more race, with Jordana's unborn baby at stake. However, de la Sol arrives, demanding the return of his money, but is run over by a squad car with Michelle and Canaro making out. Lucas, Vin, and Jordana then race off, with Vin arguing with the GPS device after it directs him to a wig shop.

The Survivalist (film)
 The film takes place following a severe drop in the global population. The Survivalist is first seen burying the body of a naked man, and then resetting a bear trap. He is then shown to be living efficiently in the wild in a small cabin; he harvests vegetable crops for food, forages berries, washes clothes in a nearby stream, fertilizes seeds with his seminal fluid, and lays traps against intruders around his small farm's perimeter.    One day, the Survivalist hears noise outside his cabin, and rushes out to find an old woman and a younger woman standing outside his door. The old woman introduces herself as Katherine, and the younger woman as her daughter, Milja. Katherine offers the Survivalist some jewellery and seeds in exchange for some of his crops, but he declines, all the while holding them at gunpoint.  Finally, Katherine offers him Milja, and an agreement is made for sex with the young woman in exchange for food. The Survivalist locks Katherine in a back room while he and Milja have sex.   The following morning, the Survivalist tells the women to take their belongings and leave. Katherine steps outside and Milja is about to join her, when suddenly she returns inside and takes a razor and some soap. Milja caresses his face, before softly shaving him.   Katherine and Milja have been allowed to stay. Over the following days, they fall into an uneasy domestic routine alongside the Survivalist; they farm during the day, eat dinner together in the evening, and then Milja and the Survivalist have sex every night. However, Katherine and Milja plan to secretly kill the Survivalist in order to reduce the amount of supplies being used. One night, on Katherine's orders, Milja steals the two last shells from the Survivalist's gun. The next morning, before their plan can be put into action, Milja is abducted by a drifter while bathing in the stream. After the Survivalist is alerted by an out-of-place footprint in the mud outside the cabin, he takes off into the woods after Milja and her assailant. After tracking them down, the Survivalist tries to load his shotgun but realizes that his shells are missing. As a result, the assailant is able to shoot the Survivalist in the stomach. The assailant approaches the wounded Survivalist, intending to shoot him again in order to kill him, but the Survivalist pulls out his knife at the last second and slits the assailant's throat. Back at the cabin, Milja and Katherine treat the Survivalist's wound, prying the bullet out and [[Cauterization|cauterizing]] the wound. When the wound becomes infected, Katherine wants to let him die, but Milja convinces Katherine to help nurse him back to health.  One night, after the Survivalist has returned to full health, a band of raiders arrive at the cabin. The Survivalist gathers Milja and Katherine, and informs them that he counted six raiders. Armed with only a shotgun with 2 shells and a pistol with one bullet salvaged from Milja's abductor, they decide that they are outnumbered and cannot fight back. They have no choice but to keep quiet while the raiders attempt, but fail, to break into the cabin. The following morning, the Survivalist, Katherine and Milja emerge from the cabin to discover that their farm has been ransacked and all of their crops have been stolen. In the following days, they work to save the farm, but they begin to slowly starve.  Meanwhile, Milja discovers she is pregnant and attempts to perform an abortion on herself with a length of wire, but she fails. Katherine again floats the idea of killing the Survivalist, explaining that there is only enough food for two people. Milja agrees that there is only enough food for two people, and suggests poisoning the Survivalist. That night, Milja makes a dish of poison mushrooms.   The following morning, Katherine tells the Survivalist that she and Milja are leaving. Milja tells her she wants to stay; Katherine immediately goes to the sink and vomits, realizing that Milja has poisoned her instead of poisoning the Survivalist. Resigned to her death, Katherine tells the Survivalist to cut her wrists and bury her after she dies, which he does. On the way back from burying Katherine, the Survivalist finds two rabbits caught in some of his traps, which would have been enough food for three people had Katherine survived. The Survivalist returns to the cabin, and tells Milja about his brother while preparing the rabbits to eat. He tells her that they used to steal supplies from camps, until one night when they were caught and chased. Realizing that there was no way that both of them would escape alive, the Survivalist cut his brother's Achilles tendon and left him to die. The Survivalist tells her that he did what he had to do to survive; in telling her this, he reassures her that she did the right thing in poisoning Katherine. Shortly thereafter, Milja wordlessly informs the Survivalist that she is pregnant by placing his hand on her belly.   The Survivalist and Milja are out foraging one day when they notice that the raiders have returned. The Survivalist decides that they need to leave the farm, but before they can, they need to collect their storage of crop seeds. Milja sneaks into their green house for the seeds and the Survivalist stands watch while the raiders ransack the cabin. Milja successfully grabs the seeds; on her way out, she grabs a machete, which makes a noise and alerts the raiders to her presence. Milja and the Survivalist run into the woods, but the raiders give chase. After the raiders surround them, the Survivalist sees a vision of his brother. He tells Milja that his brother's name was Augustus, before instructing her to run while he distracts the raiders. The Survivalist begins playing the harmonica, drawing the raiders towards him and away from Milja. One of the raiders stumbles onto Milja's location, but she lures him into a bear trap and makes her escape. The Survivalist manages to shoot and kill one of the raiders, but he is eventually shot with a crossbow bolt. His dying body is looted next to a large spit and fire made from the cabin's wood.   Milja wanders the woods alone for a long time, until she eventually arrives at a large compound, surrounded by barbed-wire fences and patrolled by armed guards. She walks up to the gate and hands her bag and her machete over to the guard on the other side. The guard runs off into the compound. Confused, Milja turns to a female guard and asks her what happens next. The guard tells Milja that a vote will be held to decide whether or not to let Milja stay. The guard then realizes that Milja is pregnant and asks if she knows what she will call the baby. Milja answers, "If it's a boy…"  
Sweet Bean
 The film centres around Sentaro, a middle-aged man who runs a small [[dorayaki]] shop in the outskirts of [[Tokyo]]. The shop is frequented by locals as well as secondary-school pupils. When he puts up a notice saying that he is looking for a co-worker, he is approached by Tokue, a lady in her mid-seventies, who states that she has always wanted to work in a dorayaki shop. Sentaro initially rejects her application, afraid that the work would prove too much for the old lady who, moreover, has somewhat deformed hands. He is swayed, however, when he tries Tokue's bean paste; its taste and texture are far superior to that of the factory-made bean paste Sentaro has been using. Sentaro asks Tokue to start making bean paste with him, revealing that up until now, he did not actually like his own product.  Business begins to thrive, and very soon Tokue also starts serving customers and packaging dorayaki. However, when customers realise that the deformities to Tokue's hand were caused by [[leprosy]], they stop coming, and Sentaro is forced to let her go. Wakana, a school girl whom Sentaro has befriended, eventually suggests that they go and visit Tokue at the sanatorium where she and other patients were forced to stay until the 1996 repeal of the [[Leprosy in Japan|1953 Leprosy Prevention Law]]. Sentaro feels guilty that he was not able to protect Tokue against the prejudice of their customers, but she assures him that she is grateful for the time she was allowed to spend at the shop.  When Tokue dies of [[pneumonia]] a few months later, she leaves Sentaro her own bean paste making equipment, as well as a cassette recording intended for him and Wakana. In it, Tokue stresses that a person's worth lies not in their career, but simply in their being, and also that joy comes from taking in the sensory experiences of the world that surrounds us.  Through most of the film, Sentaro had been a man weighed down by his past. When Tokue no longer works for the shop, he sends her a letter, in which he reveals that he once seriously injured a man in a pub brawl, something he is still ashamed of. He was subsequently imprisoned and was ordered to pay a large reparation to the victim. Physically, Sentaro is tied to the dorayaki shop, which is owned by the loan shark that furnished the money for the reparation—money which Sentaro has not yet been able to pay back. Yet at the end of the film, Sentaro is seen selling dorayaki from his own stall in the local park, and it is clear he has learned to live with his circumstances.

Swept Under
 Crime scene cleaner Morgan Sher has trouble keeping assistants because of the gruesome work.  She also struggles in her personal life to make emotional connections with others.  At a crime scene, she meets Nick Hopewell, the new partner of Detective Ed Braxton.  Braxton does not get along with Sher, as his reputation was damaged after she helped solve a crime he could not.  When her latest assistant quits after seeing the crime scene, Hopewell chats with her, and Sher impresses him with her insights into the murder.  Sher later visits the police station to give Braxton a clue she found at the crime scene while cleaning.  Upset that she seems to be trying to upstage him, Braxton ignores her.  After a one-night stand with a data entry worker, Sher encounters Hopewell again, who has become anxious to impress his captain and wants to know about the evidence she found.  After Sher hands him the tip of a cane, Hopewell requests her assistance in examining a seemingly related case, angering Braxton.  After a brief confrontation, Hopewell takes Braxton up on his ultimatum and partners with Sher instead, convincing her to take a role as a police consultant.  In return, she demands Hopewell help her clean up crime scenes.  As they grow closer, Hopewell flirts with her, only to be rebuffed by Sher, who says she has a policy against dating cops and coworkers.  Following clues left at the crime scenes, Hopewell realizes the cane may be connected in some way to [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], a French composer who died from gangrene after stabbing himself in the foot with a [[Baton_(conducting)#Ancient_history|conducting staff]].  The killer left behind a [[compact disc]] containing Lully's "Marche pour la Cèrèmonie des Turcs."  Hopewell researches the local orchestra and finds a donor who was accused of attempted rape, Gary Butler.  Butler, when questioned, is nervous and denies the rape accusation, which he says was an extortion attempt.  When Hopewell pushes him, Butler panics and leads them to Adam Fowler, a conductor.  Hopewell reasons that a serial killer has targeted people with a criminal record who are connected to the orchestra.  Butler and Fowler, though spooked, refuse to cooperate; Sher and Hopewell agree they are holding back information.  After cooking dinner for her, Hopewell convinces Sher to enter into a relationship, and she admits that personal issues in her life led her to have difficulty in starting healthy relationships.  After they have sex, Sher sneaks out of Hopewell's house with his badge and return to Butler's house.  Impersonating a police officer, she gains entry and flatly tells him she intends to kill him, revealing that she is a former rape victim kidnapped by Fowler, Butler, and the other dead men.  Before she kills him, Butler reluctantly assists her in arranging his own murder scene.  When Butler is found dead, Captain LaSalle angrily takes Hopewell off the case when she learns Hopewell suspected Butler may be the next victim.  Knowing his job on the line, Hopewell again turns to Sher for help.  After promising to help him, she murders Fowler and makes it look like a suicide, arranging the scene to give Hopewell enough evidence to close the case with Fowler revealed as the killer.  Hopewell's job and saved, and Sher becomes hopeful that she can now move beyond the trauma of her rape and have a healthy relationship with Hopewell.  Her hopes are dashed when Butler's estranged wife reveals that she set up a hidden camera in their house to gather evidence of Butler's infidelity.  The footage reveals a woman killed him, and Hopewell becomes suspicious of the case's too-perfect closure.  As he zeroes in on Sher as a suspect, Hopewell, who previously cooperated with Internal Affairs to take down dirty cops in his precinct, struggles with his rigid morality.  After finding her as she plans to flee the city, he pleads with Sher not to leave him.  As Sher turns away, she apologizes, saying that she knew he would not be able to be able to let her go.

Tag (2015 film)
 A quiet high school girl named Mitsuko survives a gust of wind which slices through her school bus, bisecting everyone else on board. She manages to escape the gust of wind, which chases her and kills all the other girls she comes into contact with. Dazed and surrounded by numerous dead high school girls, she cleans herself off and changes into another schoolgirl's uniform and stumbles onto a different high school campus. She is greeted by girls named Aki, Sur (short for "Surreal") and Taeko. Not knowing who they are, Mitsuko confesses to Aki that she cannot remember if she ever attended this school and believes that she had a nightmare about girls being killed by a gust of wind. Aki reassures her that it was just a nightmare and proposes that they all cut class and go to the woods to cheer her up.  In the woods, the girls muse about whether destiny is truly [[predeterminism|predetermined]] and whether there are multiple realities with multiple versions of themselves. Sur illustrates predetermination with a white feather, stating that it would mean the time it takes for the feather to fall and where it will land are all decided already. Mitsuko wonders if there is nothing she can do to escape destiny, but Sur suggests that fate can be tricked by simply doing something one would never normally do, thus changing the outcome. The girls happily return to school. Aki and Mitsuko's homeroom teacher begins class, but suddenly brandishes a machine gun and opens fire, killing all the girls except Mitsuko. Before she can fire another round, Sur and Taeko burst in, grab Mitsuko, and the three hide. Another homeroom teacher, who has just killed her own entire class, finds and kills Taeko and Sur. Mitsuko and the remaining girls flee the grounds, running for their lives as they are gunned down. One of the girls recognizes Mitsuko and pleads for her to do something and think about why this is happening. The remaining girls are then sliced apart by a gust of wind.  Mitsuko continues to run, and then finds herself in increasingly surreal situations where her identity and appearance change: first, as a bride named Keiko on her wedding day, who is forced to marry a grotesque groom with a boar's head while her guests (all girls from the previous school) jeer at her, then later as a student named Izumi in the middle of a marathon, flanked by her friends and well wishers (again, made up of the girls from the school and wedding ceremony). In each scenario, she is supported by a version of her friend Aki, who either readies her for combat or distracts her attackers, made up of the groom and the two homeroom teachers from before. In every scenario, she must flee while the surrounding girls are slaughtered in various ways.  After encountering a group of revenant girls who try to kill her after stating that so long as she lives, they all will continue to die, she is once again rescued by Aki. Aki tells her to focus and remember that although she is both Keiko and Izumi in these scenarios, she is ultimately Mitsuko. After returning to her original appearance as Mitsuko, Aki tells her that the two of them and all the girls are in a fictional world being observed by "someone" and that they will continue to hunt Mitsuko down and try to kill her while slaughtering the other girls unless Mitsuko, as the "[[protagonist|main character]]", does something to change it. Each of the scenarios she encountered is a different world, and to reach the final one, Aki tells her that Mitsuko must brutally kill her. Urged on by Aki, Mitsuko reluctantly kills her and a portal opens up before her.  She finds herself in a lewd, dingy city called "Men's World" filled with only men who pervertedly enjoy a poster advertisement for a "legendary" violent [[Video game graphics#3D|3D]] [[survival horror|survival horror video game]] called "Tag," depicting Mitsuko, Keiko, and Izumi as playable characters. She passes out and awakens in a temple where all the girls from the various scenarios are showcased like mannequins. She arrives at a room where a decrepit old man is playing the game on his TV, showing the various trials she went through. Mitsuko is horrified to see full size models of herself, Keiko, Izumi, Aki, Sur, and Taeko behind a glass display case. The man tells her that she is in the future and that 150 years ago, she was a girl he had admired as a fellow student. When she died, he managed to take her DNA and that of all her friends and make clones for his 3D game. A younger version of the old man appears beside a bed and strips down, beckoning her to come to bed with him. The old man tells her that the final stage is the fulfillment of his deepest wish and he tells her to succumb to her destiny. Instead, Mitsuko attacks the younger man, screaming at him to stop playing with girls like toys. She rips one of the pillows, showering the room with feathers. Remembering what Sur said about tricking fate, she then commits suicide by stabbing herself, to the shock of both the old man and his younger self. Finding herself once again in the beginning of each of the three game scenarios, she simultaneously commits suicide on the bus, at the wedding chapel, and during the marathon before any of the violent scenarios can begin. Mitsuko then awakens alone in a field of white snow, gets up, and runs away, realizing that "it's over now."  
Synchronicity (film)
 Physicist Jim Beale, working with two colleagues (Chuck and Matt), invents a machine that makes time travel possible. The machine operates by creating one half of a [[wormhole]] during one run, the other half during a second run. In addition, the process is expensive and dangerous. To activate the process requires radioactive material created by KMC, a company owned by Klaus Meisner, a venture capitalist.  If the material is mishandled as part of the process, the machine will malfunction - creating a devastating explosion. During the first test, Beale receives a genetically-created [[Dahlia]] flower from the wormhole. Beale cannot prove his invention actually works without Meisner's material for a second test. Meisner demands 50% ownership of the process in exchange for the material, but he gets 49%. The second test is scheduled for one week after the first.  Soon after the first test, Beale meets Abby Ross, who seems to know too much about him for their meeting to be coincidental. He is attracted to her, but also suspicious. His suspicions are apparently confirmed when Chuck calls him on his cell phone and tells Beale that Abby is not to be trusted and the test has succeeded much more than they thought. Beale leaves Abby and rushes back to the lab, but Chuck refuses to explain. Beale later ignores his suspicions and starts a relationship with Abby. They discover a deep bond, which is broken when Chuck's warning is confirmed: Abby tells Meisner about the flower. Meisner threatens Beale with knowledge of the flower, the intellectual property of another of his companies. Meisner extorts Beale for another 50% ownership of Beale's research, leaving Beale with 1%.  Heartbroken and not thinking clearly, during the second test Beale jumps into the wormhole and is transported one week into the past to the time of the first test.  Beale is convinced that on this "second run", he can outwit Meisner and Abby and prevent his research from falling into their hands. He seduces Abby but soon learns that she was honestly attracted to him: a science writer herself, she had read an article about him and crafted a fanciful story in a journal about what he must be like. Having learned more about him from Meisner and from learning about his work, she is powerfully attracted to him. Beale reads the fictional story but finds that it is both a somewhat inaccurate representation of his work and is unfinished.  Complications arise: the "second run" Beale becomes physically weakened, and experiences pain when in close proximity to "Jim Prime", the Beale from before jumping into the wormhole. Beale reveals himself to Chuck and Matt in the hopes of securing their help to protect the research. They both assist Beale and conceal his presence from Jim Prime, explaining several confusing interactions in the week before the second test. Beale is jealous of Jim Prime, but there is no need: Jim Prime is still suspicious of Abby and it is clear that he will have nothing to do with her after the second test because of her betrayal.  Beale continues to weaken. He encounters Abby's journal again (this time in Matt's hands) and is confused - in the first timeline, it was at Abby's apartment. Matt says he found it in Jim's coat pocket when he came out of the wormhole. The journal is now subtly different and it makes it clear that Beale has jumped not back in time, but into the past of a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]], slightly different from the one he left. Slight [[Paradox|inconsistencies]] Beale has not noticed in this timeline are explained. Chuck says that it is impossible for two Beales to exist in the same universe, so the "second run" Beale will die and only Jim Prime will remain.  Beale enlists Chuck and Matt's help in making an unscheduled wormhole to send himself to the past with his new knowledge to try and prevent the research from being stolen. A mistake is made in the process, preventing the time jump and wasting the radioactive material.  The date of the second test arrives. Beale finds another time-displaced Jim dead in a hotel after trying to leave the city. He returns to the Grand Hotel, where he sees Abby's apparent betrayal was to get more material to make the second test happen to send Jim Prime away and save Beale's life. The second test happens as before, but when Abby returns to the Grand Hotel, Beale has already died.  After, Abby is alone in a cafe when Jim Prime - apparently healthy - sits down across from her. Jim reveals a deep attraction to Abby, and introduces himself. Abby acknowledges his similarity in appearance to the physicist "John Bain" whom she is writing a novel about. However, as far as she knew, John Bain was killed in a devastating explosion in his lab. The unspoken implication is that Jim Prime would not wither away like Beale did, as he entered a universe with no other Jim present.

However, later, Khempal's decomposed body is found on the terrace of the building in which the Tandons live. The police question Khempal's close friend and Tandons' assistant Kanhaiya. Kanhaiya tells the police that Ramesh Tandon might have been involved in an extra-marital affair, and Khempal might have been involved in a relationship with Shruti. The police start suspecting the Tandons, and after sometime, declare the murders as a clear case of honour killing. On 25 March, the Noida police arrest Ramesh Tandon for the two murders. The police chief organizes a press conference in which he declares that Ramesh murdered Shruti and Khempal after finding them in a compromising position. This character assassination of Shruti leads to public outrage, and the case is handed over to the Central Department of Investigation (CDI), the country's elite investigating police agency.<ref name="BH_review_2015"/><ref name="JP_case_timeline"></ref><ref name="SJ_Reuters_2015"/>  The CDI team is led by Joint Director Ashwin Kumar ([[Irrfan Khan]]) and ACP Vedant ([[Soham Shah]]).

On 9 July 2008, CDI hands over the case to a new probe team led by Kumar's former boss Paul ([[Atul Kumar (actor)|Atul Kumar]]), who concludes that the parents committed the murders. In the final act, rival camps (of Kumar and Paul), with opposing hypotheses, make their cases before the CDI chief.

Tale of Tales (2015 film)
 The Baroque stories manage to mix real and surreal with many metaphorical usages. ''[[Pentamerone]]'' was a 17th-century collection of Italian [[fairytales]].<ref name="Tale of Tales Movie Review"></ref>  The three tales are ''[[The Enchanted Doe|La Cerva Fatata]]'' (''The Enchanted Doe''), ''[[The Flea (fairy tale)|La Pulce]]'' (''The Flea''), ''La Vecchia Scorticata'' (''The Flayed Old Lady''), that have been freely adapted with elements of other tales by [[Giambattista Basile]], as well as a touch of artistic license.<ref name="Tale of Tales Movie Review"/> All three stories are told in a mixed way, pieced in fragments through the whole film, with all three briefly joining for a royal funeral near the start and a royal coronation at the end.  ===The Queen=== [[File:Gole dell'Alcantara-pjt1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alcantara (river)|Alcantara river]]: segment of ''The Queen'']] The first tale begins in the kingdom of Longtrellis, where the King and Queen have tried everything to have a child, but are not successful. The King loves his Queen, but all she desires is a child. One night, a [[Necromancy|necromancer]] suggests a risky solution: if the Queen eats the heart of an aquatic dragon cooked by a virgin, she will instantly become with child. However, this will come at the cost of a life. The Queen accepts, not caring about the price. The King sets off to slay the aquatic dragon, and dies doing so. The Queen does not mourn the loss of her husband; she only cares for the dragon's heart. After eating the heart, the queen bears a son, Elias, in one day's time. The servant who cooked the heart for the Queen, who accidentally became pregnant by inhaling the steam from the heart, also gives birth to a boy, Jonah. The two boys are nearly identical and have hair as white as the dragon.  As a young man, Elias's affections are not for the Queen, but for his friend Jonah, whom he views as a brother. This greatly hurts the Queen, who eventually attempts to murder Jonah herself, after finding the boys are so close that Jonah can pretend to be Elias without her knowing. In response, Jonah leaves the kingdom, leaving his mother and Elias behind. Elias is heartbroken and tries to convince Jonah to stay, but Jonah says he must go. Jonah takes a knife and plunges it into the root of a tree, out of which a spring flows forth. Jonah tells Elias that as long as the tree continues to spout clear water, he will know that Jonah is alive and well.   One day, Elias comes to the tree to find the water clouded with blood. He immediately leaves to find Jonah. When Elias arrives in a distant village, Jonah's pregnant sweetheart and friends mistake him for Jonah. By claiming to have lost his memory, Elias discovers that Jonah has been missing since he went to the woods five days ago. Elias goes to search for him.  The Queen has all her subjects look for Elias to no avail. The following night, the necromancer comes again to the Queen and tells her it is her fault that Elias has disappeared – that she has tried to separate what is inseparable. The Queen asks for her son to return. The necromancer says a violent desire such as hers can only be satisfied with violence. Without knowing the terms, the Queen follows the necromancer down the hall.   The next day, Elias finds Jonah wounded in a cave, having fallen through the cave's roof while he was in the woods. They are threatened by a large, bat-like monster. As the two struggle to escape, the bat manages to wound Jonah with its sharp talons. Elias puts himself between Jonah and the bat, and the monster hesitates to strike out again. Elias uses the moment to kill the monster to save Jonah. He returns Jonah to his sweetheart before departing. In the cave, the bat creature's corpse turns to dust, and it is revealed it was the queen, transformed by the necromancer.  ===The Two Old Women=== [[File:Castello di Roccascalegna.JPG|thumb|[[Castello di Roccascalegna|Castle of Roccascalegna]]: segment of ''Two Old Women'']] In the second story, the lustful King of Strongcliff is intrigued by a mysterious woman’s heavenly singing. Determined to seduce her, he courts her outside her home, unaware that she is one of two elderly dyer sisters, Imma and Dora. Dora first offers the King the touch of one finger, but the King persists, so Dora agrees to spend the night with him as long as it is in complete darkness, to hide her appearance from him. However, once she is asleep, the King lights a candle to see Dora's face. When he sees her appearance, he is horrified at having slept with her. The King calls for his guards to throw Dora out of the bed chamber window to her apparent death. The bed sheet around Dora becomes entangled in the branches of a tree before she reaches the ground. A witch rescues her from the tree and nurses her from her breast. Dora awakens in the woods as a young, beautiful maiden. Later, the King comes upon her while hunting and decides to make her his Queen.   Enjoying her new appearance, Dora sends Imma a gown and an invitation to the wedding festivities at the castle. Dora draws Imma aside at the castle and tells her to keep the secret, as no one would believe her. Dora promises to take care of Imma and tells her that she missed her very much. At the end of the night, Imma refuses to leave the castle and her sister. Dora tells Imma that they can't be together because she might lose everything and sends her away. However, she comes back and asks for the secret to her sister's youth and beauty so that they can be together, but Dora says she doesn't know how it happened, as she woke up that way.  Imma doesn't believe her and badgers her for the truth. In annoyance, Dora says she flayed herself and grew new skin. With the King approaching, Dora hides Imma behind a screen and begins to consummate her marriage with the King. Imma is fascinated by the sight and reveals herself. The King sees her and thinks she is the "witch" he slept with. He calls for his guards to throw her out. Dora tells the King that Imma is her old neighbour and begs him not to hurt her. Outside the castle, Imma tries to find someone who will flay her. She eventually finds a knife sharpener willing to do the job in exchange for her fine jewelry. He takes Imma out into the woods and flays her skin and leaves Imma bloody and disfigured. The last we see of her is as she walks towards the castle, bloody and injured.  ===The Flea=== [[File:Castel del Monte, Andria.jpg|thumb|[[Castel del Monte, Apulia|Castel del Monte]]: segment of ''The Flea'']] The third story arc is about the King of Highhills who lives with his daughter, Violet. Violet loves her father and plays him a song that she has written for him. During the performance, the King is distracted by a flea that can mysteriously move from one of his hands to the other. He captures the flea and hides it in his room as his pet, feeding it his own blood and, later, under-cooked steaks. The flea grows into a gigantic [[Kafka]]esque domesticated creature. When the flea dies, the King is devastated and decides to skin it. He offers to give his daughter as a bride to whoever is able to guess the source of the tanned skin. An [[ogre]] solves the riddle and wins the princess as his bride. Violet, who has dreamed of marrying someone handsome and brave, threatens suicide by plunging off the castle's tower, but her father stops her, saying he had never intended for this to happen but can't go back on his word. In tears, Violet agrees to go through with the marriage, stating that her father never loved her at all.   The Ogre takes Violet to his cave near the top of a mountain, where she is raped and kept prisoner. One day while the Ogre is hunting, Violet spots a woman, who is an entertainer, on the other side of the cliff. She begs the woman for help. The woman tells her she will return tomorrow with her sons. The next day, the woman and her husband and sons try to save the Princess by tying a rope to the other side of the cliff, with one of the sons walking across it while carrying the Princess on his back. As the entertainers' son is walking across the tightrope, the Ogre notices the Princess's absence and is enraged that the Princess has been taken. However, they manage to cut the rope before the Ogre reaches them, and the Ogre falls to the depths below. However, the Ogre manages to survive, and finds the group, slaying the entertainers' entire family. He is about to kill the Princess, but she placates him with tender gestures. He relents and motions for the Princess to climb onto his back, so he can take her back to the cave. The Princess pretends to get on by placing an arm around him and slits his throat with a knife hidden in the hand of her other arm.  During the time that Violet has been away, the King has grown ill. When Violet returns, the King breaks down in tears. Violet throws the Ogre's head at her father's feet and reminds him that this is the husband he chose for her, his daughter. After the King falls to his knees, the subjects follow suit, suggesting she is now Queen. Seeing her father in tears, Violet, too, begins to cry.  ===Ending=== In the end, Elias, Dora, and her lustful King are among the guests present at Kingdom Highhills for Violet's official coronation as Queen. There, Elias nods to her, as well as the King of Strongcliff. As Violet's father walks her to the throne, everyone in the crowd looks up to the sky, where an entertainer is walking across a tightrope that is on fire. At this time, Dora's beauty begins to fade and she begins to return to her former state. Before anyone notices what is happening to her, she manages to flee the Highhills castle alone.  
Tanna (film)
 On the island of [[Tanna (island)|Tanna]], people following the [[Kastom]] have always enforced [[arranged marriage]]s. The people of Kastom Road face sporadic conflicts with the Imedin tribe, while two followers of Kastom, Dain and Wawa, continue a secret love affair. Wawa's young sister Selin is impudent, stealing a penis sheath and running into the wilderness, berated for entering the forbidden zone where the Imedin once massacred their people. To teach Selin respect, her grandfather and the tribe's [[shaman]] takes her to the spiritual site of Yahul and the [[volcano]]es. There, the Imedin attack the shaman, clubbing him, leaving him mortally wounded. Selin escapes and runs back to her people, who retrieve the shaman, while afraid his inevitable death will leave them vulnerable. The Imedin are summoned to the village to make peace. They trade pigs, which the shaman's murderers club to death just as they had the shaman, and Wawa is promised for marriage into the Imedin tribe.  Despite the arranged marriage, Wawa and Dain continue their affair. The elders learn of this, and plead to Wawa to give up the relationship. The elder women sympathize with Wawa for having to go through an arranged marriage, but tell her respect for her elders and the law will lead to happiness. Her peers also tell Wawa that she is not the only one whose interests are at stake. If the Imedin lose Wawa as a promised bride, they will likely seek revenge. Wawa reveals that she has already had sex with Dain, meaning she will be unacceptable to the Imedin anyway. Disgraced, Dain is [[exile]]d from the village. The elders continue to urge Wawa to accept her arranged marriage, pointing to the English royal family to prove arranged marriage means love.  Wawa joins Dain in the wilderness, and live among the volcanoes, while their people and the Imedin both search for them. The two eat poisoned mushrooms. Their people bury them, and the elders agree recognition of [[love marriage]] must be added to the Kastom to keep their culture alive.  
Tank 432
  In a forest, mercenaries Reeves and Karlsson rejoin the rest of their squad – Gantz, Capper, Evans, commanding officer Smith, along with two hooded and bound captives. Reeves reports fleeing from a group of hostiles, as Karlsson sedates Capper, whose leg is badly wounded. Evans reports a farm and jeep nearby, and Smith orders them to investigate. At the farm, Reeves vomits after seeing a mysterious orange powder. Evans, already nervous, becomes increasingly erratic after finding the jeep's engine has been sabotaged in a gruesome manner. As Karlsson sedates Evans and tends to Capper, Reeves and Gantz explore the farm.  Reeves and Gantz find mercenaries, whom they refer to as "group D", and two other captives, all decapitated, in a barn. As they return, they hear music from a storage container. They find a woman inside, who panics when they turn off the music. Karlsson sedates her and Smith orders her brought along. An enemy flare is shot off, and Smith orders a retreat, leaving Capper behind. Gantz and Evan fire at a hooded figure before retreating, but Evan returns as Capper calls out. The rest flee through a field until they encounter an abandoned armoured personnel carrier. Seeking refuge, they throw out its cargo while Gantz fires at another hooded figure. One of the prisoners stabs Gantz, and Reeves kills her.  Once inside the vehicle, they hear noises from outside as attackers attempt to open the door, which  Gantz then jams. Karlsson gives them tranquilizers to help them sleep. Smith orders Gantz to fix the tank. Gantz finds a rotting corpse in the front of the vehicle, but fails to start the engine. He sees another strange figure outside the viewport. Searching the vehicle for tools, they find bottles of orange powder labelled "Kratos". Annabella, the surviving prisoner, claims to be a teacher and explains it means "strength and power" in ancient Greek. She secretly pockets a flare gun from a toolcase.  Reeves dreams of the monster Gantz saw and an argument between Smith and the others about the notebook he constantly writes. He awakens and questions Annabella, who claims to not remember why she is there. The next morning, the argument Reeves dreamt occurs, but Smith refuses to show the notebook. Gantz attempts to repair the engine again, but cannot reach it. He reports an orange powder on the engine, before seeing a monstrous, gasmask-wearing enemy outside the vehicle. After being calmed, he refuses to return, and Karlsson sedates him. Smith orders Reeves to attempt to fix the engine next. Karlsson begins looking through files stored in the vehicle, and finds they are dossiers on the mercenaries and their captives, identifying them as dead, including Smith. Smith expresses disbelief, saying he did not expect that many casualties, but claims he doesn't know anything. Reeves inspects the corpse in the front of the vehicle, and finds that the dog tags are for Evans.  As Reeves attempts to fix the engine, Capper appears and taunts them, refusing to open the hatch. He suggests Smith knows what is going on, and asks Karlsson if she knows what she has been injecting everyone with. As Smith and Karlsson argue, Annabella shoots Smith with the flare gun, killing him. Karlsson kills her, before realizing she was accidentally shot by Smith when he was attacked. Before Karlsson dies, she reads through Smith's mission notes, finding that Smith has been recording the dosages of the red-tinted sedative.   Reeves is able to start the engine. Egged on by Capper, who ingests Kratos, Reeves attempts to run him over. Capper eventually trips and falls, and challenges Reeves to run him over, which Reeves does. Later, after Reeves has stopped the vehicle, the rescued woman wakes and discovers everyone but Reeves dead. She finds that the hatch is no longer jammed, and flees. Figures in hazmat suits and gas masks arrive, along with a gas masked man in a suit. Finding a survivor in the vehicle, he declares "It worked, good." before ordering Reeves killed. The forest from the start is shown again, as a loudspeaker announces that an experiment is about to begin, and a soldier emerges from a white box.

Terminator Genisys
  Human Resistance leader [[John Connor]] ([[Jason Clarke]]) launches a final offensive against [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]], an [[artificial general intelligence]] system in 2029. Before the Resistance can triumph, Skynet activates a [[Time travel|time machine]] and sends a [[Terminator (character)|T-800 (Model 101) Terminator]] back to May 12, 1984, to kill John's mother [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah]] ([[Emilia Clarke]]). John's right-hand man, [[Kyle Reese]] ([[Jai Courtney]]), volunteers to travel back in time to protect her. As Kyle floats in the machine's magnetic field, he sees John being attacked by another Resistance soldier ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) and has visions from his childhood about Sarah Connor.  When it arrives in [[Los Angeles]] 1984, Skynet's T-800 is disabled by Sarah and "Pops" ([[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]), a reprogrammed T-800 sent to protect Sarah when she was nine years old. Kyle arrives shortly afterwards, and is intercepted by a [[T-1000]] ([[Lee Byung-hun]]). Sarah and Pops join Kyle and destroy the T-1000 with acid; she and Pops reveal that they have constructed a makeshift time machine similar to Skynet's, and Sarah plans to travel to 1997 (the year Skynet becomes self-aware). Realizing that the timeline has been altered, Kyle is convinced that the future has changed because of the warning he received in his childhood vision and persuades Sarah to travel to 2017 to stop Skynet.  Kyle and Sarah arrive on August 28, 2017, materialize in the middle of a busy [[San Francisco]] highway and are apprehended by [[San Francisco Police Department|city police]]. While they are treated for injuries, Sarah and Kyle learn that Skynet is called "Genisys" (a soon-to-be-unveiled global [[operating system]] which is embraced by the public). John suddenly appears and rescues Sarah and Kyle; Pops arrives and unexpectedly shoots John, revealing that John is an advanced [[T-3000]] Terminator. While Kyle was traveling back in time a [[T-5000]] (Smith), the physical embodiment of Skynet disguised as a member of the Resistance, attacked John and transformed him into a [[Nanotechnology|nanocyte]] infiltrator. John, tasked with ensuring [[Skynet (Terminator)#Before Judgment Day|Cyberdyne Systems']] survival, traveled back in time to assist them with the development of Genisys and hence securing Skynet and its machines' rise.  A day before Skynet's worldwide attack, Sarah, Kyle and Pops escape to a [[safe house]] and make final preparations to destroy Cyberdyne's Genisys mainframe. They head toward Cyberdyne's headquarters with the T-3000 in close pursuit. During an airborne chase, Pops dive-bombs into the T-3000's helicopter and causes it to crash. The T-3000 survives the crash and enters the Cyberdyne complex, where it advances the countdown from 13 hours to 15 minutes. Kyle, Sarah and Pops plant bombs at key points in the facility while holding off the T-3000.  In a final battle, Pops traps the T-3000 in the magnetic field of a prototypical time machine. Both are destroyed, but just before the explosion the T-3000 throws the remains of Pops into a nearby experimental vat of [[Terminator (character concept)#Liquid metal nanorobotics|mimetic polyalloy]]. Kyle and Sarah reach a bunker beneath the facility and the explosion sets off the bombs, preventing Genisys from coming online. Pops appears, upgraded with mimetic polyalloy components similar to that of the T-1000, and helps them escape from the debris.  The trio travels to Kyle's childhood home, where Kyle tells his younger self about Genisys and instructs him to repeat the warning to himself, securing the trio's arrival from 1984. Sarah and Kyle finally kiss and they along with Pops drive off into the countryside. A [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]] reveals that the system core of Genisys, located in a protected subterranean chamber, has survived the explosion.

Terminus (2015 film)
 Reports of a downed extraterrestrial object bring the attention of U.S. government agents.  Although disappointed that they find no living specimens, the agents take an eyewitness into custody to observe him after they find he is no longer blind.  Elsewhere, David Chamberlain, a mechanic who has not recovered from the death of his wife Jane, struggles to keep his job.  Zach, a veteran of a war currently ongoing in Iran, asks for a job, though David must turn him down.  David later helps Zach in a bar fight, learning that Zach is missing a leg.  When David returns home, his daughter Annabelle tells him that his last two payments failed to go through, and she has  been forced to return home from college.  Upset, David takes a car ride and crashes after seeing an object streak down from the sky.  When David fails to return home the next morning, Annabelle looks for him.  She finds him wandering near his crashed car and takes him to the hospital.  A doctor informs Annabelle that David inexplicably has two functioning kidneys even though records show that one was removed in the past to transplant into his wife, which was rejected by her body which presumably lead to her death.  Now obsessed with the object, David becomes convinced it is giving him instructions through his dead wife.  Meanwhile, the agents supervise surgery on the eyewitness and argue with their supervisor to continue their research.  He says the continuing war in Iran is necessary to raise the country's morale and takes precedence over any possible evidence of extraterrestrial contact.  David hires Zach to help him retrieve the object.  As they do so, Zach touches it and becomes unnerved by the feedback.  While protesting the advancing war amid reports that Russia, China, and France have threatened retaliation against the U.S. push into Iran, Zach experiences pain in his amputated leg.  When he realizes that his leg is slowly regrowing, he returns to David to demand an explanation.  David tells Annabelle and Zach about the object and insists that Zach must be brought into proximity with it.  Zach's leg rapidly regenerates, causing him to join David's quest to create a large structure David believes the object wants built.  They steal materials from a local junkyard, putting everything in an abandoned factory.  The agents, lured by reports of unexplained regeneration, come to David's house.  Though David initially denies any knowledge, when they confront him with the hospital records, he says the object melted.  Disbelieving him, the agents tail David, only to lose him when his friend Tony Cerillo helps.  As the conflict in Iran escalates, David comes to believe the structure will save Annabelle from the oncoming nuclear war.  When Cerillo investigates the missing materials from the junkyard, he confronts David, who accidentally kills him.  Filled with remorse, David confides to Jane that he believes himself unworthy of the object, and she confirms that it was meant for others, whom David must assist.  Government scientists inform the agents that the object is an example of [[abiogenesis]].  Frustrated with delays, the agents return to David's house, where they take Zach and Annabelle hostage.  David rescues them as they begin torturing Zach.  As they escape, Agent Stipe shoots Annabelle, knowing David will return to the object to heal her.  There, Agent Stipe shoots David.  His subordinate, Agent Lubinski, objects, saying that the object should not be used to further the war effort.  Zach, Stipe, and Lubinski engage in a firefight, and all are wounded.  David helps Zach and Annabelle into the structure, apologizes for not being able to join them, and seals them in it just as a nuclear war begins.  When Zach and Annabelle emerge, the world is in ruins and centuries appear to have passed, leaving the structure rusted and overgrown with vegetation.  
Ten Years (2015 film)
 The film comprises five short stories set in the year 2025.  ===''Extras''=== Prior to an [[International Labour Day]] celebration, government officials concoct a [[false flag]] assassination plot to foment public support for legislation of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|National Security Law]]. They hire two petty gangsters to execute the plot: Hairy (Zerisawa Courtney Wu), a middle-aged low-level [[Triad (organized crime)|triad]] member, and Peter (Peter Chan), an immigrant from India. While the two argue over who should fire the gun, the director of the [[Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|Liaison Office]] decides that the leaders of both the TMD and the Fortune Parties are to get shot with real bullets, so as to instigate greater panic in the territory. Misbelieving they will get paid and flee to India afterwards, both Hairy and Peter attempt the assassination but are killed instantly on scene by the police. Later, the government identifies the perpetrators as terrorists and restates the significance of the upcoming legislation.  Director Kwok Zune stated that the triad-like behaviour of the officials was inspired by real-world pro-establishment groups in Hong Kong, who were accused of beating and sexually assaulting pro-democratic protesters during the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]].<ref name=scmp1/>  ===''Season of the End''=== Wong Ching (herself) and Lau Ho-chi (himself) attempt to preserve objects from homes destroyed by [[bulldozer]]s. The last specimen Lau wants to create is his own body.  ===''Dialect''=== As the government enacts laws limiting operating areas of non-[[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]-speaking [[Hong Kong taxi|taxi]] drivers, a Cantonese-speaking driver (Leung Kin-ping) finds himself marginalised as he fails to pass the national Mandarin proficiency test. The driver's wife instructs him to stop using Cantonese with their son, Kongson, so that the boy will do better at his Mandarin [[medium of instruction]] school. A series of vignettes further illustrate the increasing dominance of Mandarin and Leung's struggle adjusting. He is unable to make himself understood by his Mandarin GPS unit and is ridiculed by a passenger for it. Two Mandarin-speaking fares opt to take another cab when they realise he cannot speak the language. One of his passengers, an office lady ([[Catherine Chau]]), is fired from her job for failing to clearly explain something to a client in Mandarin.  The film alludes to a 2003 real-world proposal by the [[Transport Department]] that failed, as well as a regulation introduced in [[Wuhan]].<ref name=scmp1/> In [[Mainland China]], Mandarin (a.k.a. Putonghua) is promoted as a national language, and legislation such as the [[Guangdong National Language Regulations]] restricts the use of Cantonese and all other varieties of Chinese. The name ''Dialect'' comes from the fact that the Mainland government refers to Cantonese as a [[dialect]] despite the fact that it is [[mutually unintelligible]] with Mandarin.<ref name=cnn1/> The short was directed by Jevons Au Man-kit, a graduate of the [[The Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts|Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts]], who said that the taxi driver's plight was influenced by his own struggles to write scripts in Mandarin in an increasingly Mainland-oriented Hong Kong film sector.<ref name=scmp1/>  ===''Self-immolator''=== [[File:HK British Consulate Justice Drive 1.JPG|thumb|The British Consulate-General, location of the eponymous self-immolation]] Au-yeung Kin-fung (Ng Siu-hin), a young hardline supporter for [[Hong Kong independence]], becomes the first to be convicted under the National Security Law and dies during a [[hunger strike]] in prison. An unknown person commits [[self-immolation]] in front of the [[British Consulate-General, Hong Kong|British Consulate-General]] in [[Admiralty, Hong Kong|Admiralty]]. This escalates public concerns about Hong Kong's undecided future beyond 2047. Au-yeung's friend Karen (Tanzela Qoser) is initially feared to be the self-immolator but is later revealed to have been kidnapped by secret police. Au-yeung's allies, led by Marco ([[Neo Yau Hawk-Sau|Neo Yau]]), break into and set fire to the [[Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|Central Government Liaison Office]] in [[Sai Wan]], while a group of Christians gather and pray outside the British Consulate-General to urge the Britons to uphold the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] co-signed with the Beijing authorities. The Communist Party labels the demand for independence a diplomatic affair, thereby justifying the deployment of the [[People's Liberation Army]] in the city. The protests in Sai Wan and Admiralty are crushed violently. As a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] reveals, after witnessing Au-yeung being severely beaten by police, an old woman was moved to commit self-immolation outside the British Consulate-General. The film ends on a prolonged shot of her umbrella burning, alluding to the [[Umbrella Movement]].  The storytelling is intertwined with interviews with commentators analysing ongoing events and providing background information such as Hong Kong's removal from the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|UN decolonisation list]] in 1972 at China's behest.  Directed by Chow Kwun-wai, ''Self-immolator'' alludes to the common practice of self-immolation in Mainland China as a form of protest, particularly [[List of political self-immolations|among Tibetans]].<ref name=cnn1/> Chow stated that while the plot of this piece may seem extreme, "In 2004, people would also find it hard to believe that [the police can drag a protester into a dark corner and beat him up]", alluding to the [[beating of Ken Tsang]] and other incidents of police brutality during the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]].<ref name=scmp1></ref>  ===''Local Egg''=== Sam ([[Liu Kai-chi]]), a grocery store keeper, is told about the closure of the last chicken farm in Hong Kong. He then visits his egg supplier, farm owner Cheung who recalls the government's actions to gradually kill off [[Agriculture and aquaculture in Hong Kong|the industry]] despite the fact that he has been meeting their demands. Sam's store is frequently checked by Youth Guards, members of a [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]]-like uniform group, since his use of "local eggs" on his label is on the censor list. He doubts why "local eggs" must be relabeled "Hong Kong eggs" when they refer to the same thing. Sam finds his son Ming among a squad of Youth Guards [[Egging|throwing eggs]] at a bookstore, but Ming assures his father that he has kept his teaching in mind and has not participated in the vandalism; instead, he often leaks the censor lists and actions to bookstore keepers so that they can remain safe and preserve the books. Relaxed at his son's critical thinking, Sam reminds a bookstore keeper not to get used to such suppressive acts.<ref name=ejinsight1/>  ===Epilogue=== ''Ten Years'' ends with a quote from the [[Book of Amos]]: }} and "Already too late" fading out and replaced by "Not too late".

Thani Oruvan
   A low-level party cadre Sengalvarayan ([[Thambi Ramaiah]]) is dedicated to his leader and party. He and his son Pazhani who secures the first rank in his 10th standard state exam, visits the party deputy-leader, now the chairman of the party and a member of the ruling coalition for his blessings with his father. While they are waiting in the party office for the leader to come in, they witness a murder of a rebel party candidate by their own revered leader due to caste-related comments by the rebel on him. When the leader asks Sengalvarayan to take the blame by saying that he killed the man due to rage about the rebel's comments, Pazhani volunteers to take the blame and is willing to go to jail, citing the leniency of juvenile laws in exchange for an MLA seat for his father in the upcoming by-election.  15 years later, trainee [[Indian Police Service|IPS]] officers Mithran, Shakthi, Suraj, Kathiresan and Janardhan "Jana", discreetly assist the police in catching a gang which kidnapped four girls. One day Mithran receives a cryptic text message on his phone from an anonymous number stating that he/she is aware of their discreet activities. In the evening, they go out to meet that person who is revealed to be Mahima ([[Nayantara]]), who loves Mithran. Later that same night they happen to witness the murder of a man named Ramar who is a social activist with the pretense of snatch theft. Mithran and his friend catch the gang and their leader and hand them over to the police; however, four days later the leader of the gang comes to the IPS headquarters with the home minister. This political and organised crime comes as a shock to Mithran and his friends. Mithran takes them to his house and shows his research on connecting all small unrelated incidents into the global view of a hidden network of politicians, industrialists and criminals who bend the law for their own financial benefits. He singles out three prominent business oligarchs (a pharmaceutical mogul, a mineral magnate and a don). When he tries following one he realizes that all three of them work as a group and they all work for a wealthy and influential scientist Siddharth Abhimanyu. After the completion of his training, Mithran is awarded medals for specializing in dealing with organized crime during training and also for being the best probationer of the batch, and is posted as the ASP of the Organized Crime Unit.  Mithran discovers that Siddharth is Sengalvarayan's son Pazhani. After his release from prison, Pazhani had his name changed and left India to complete his education abroad. After his graduation, he returned to India and is now a well-established scientist. Siddarth uses the medical field for the wrong reasons and his own profit. Sengalvarayan is now the incumbent health and welfare minister in the minority government headed by the party leader. At that time Angelina, a Swiss pharmaceutical company owner and activist tries to make [[Generic drug|generic medicines]] for life-threatening diseases available in India at low cost affordable by poor people. Siddharth's assassin kills Angelina before she can sign the agreement document with the government and shoots Mithran at the same time. While he is recovering from the gunshot wound in the hospital, an [[Covert listening device|electronic bug]] ([[Global Positioning System|GPS]] + audio transmitter) is implanted during surgery. Through the bug, Siddharth listens to all of Mithran's plans and continuously monitors his whereabouts and whatever he talks via an audio transmission. Then comes evidence against Siddharth in the form of Manimekalai ([[Abhinaya (actress)|Abhinaya]]). She was a scientist at Siddharth's research lab, where a seaweed that can cure [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] is found abundantly in the oceans. Siddharth tries to sell the technology and rights to extract medicine from the seaweed to multinational pharmaceutical companies but is opposed by Manimekalai. So Siddharth arranges goons and the goons rape and kill her. But before being killed, she records a video and stores it in an [[Secure Digital|SD card]] so that someone will find it. But before Mithran can find the card, Siddharth finds out and assigns Vicky ([[Vamsi Krishna]]) to recover the card, but Mithran tells Jana to get the card. He successfully gets the card after a fight with Vicky, but through the bug, Siddharth knows this and kills Jana.  Mithran comes back to his special house where he finds a pin has been changed in a picture which turns out to be the picture of Ananya who was Miss World 2011 and a close acquaintance of Siddharth whose girlfriend Shilpa ([[Mugdha Godse]]) was also part of that event. Mithran doubts whether Siddharth himself would have come to his house. Mahima checks the fingerprints on the pin keeping the gun case Mithran received from Siddharth in his posting ceremony and the fingerprints match. A flashback reveals that Siddharth killed Shilpa's father so that she would not participate in the competition and as she will not have a ticket to go to her father's funeral he offers to take her in his chartered flight and wins her over. Mithran frantically searches for the bug which he eventually finds out and removes.  Mithran captures Vicky and records all the information from him. He drugs Vicky and manipulates Siddharth into killing him. At the same time, Siddharth's father reads the changed medical report, which contains very good medical contracts for public welfare and multiple accusations against the CM. When Siddharth learns about this, he asks Sengalvarayan to pretend to have chest pains and move outside to hospital. The ruling party forces Sengalvarayan either to resign within 24 hours or he will be dismissed. Mithran appeals to the CM that he has evidence and wants to arrest Siddharth, and he is granted permission to do so. Hence Siddarth kills his father using his goons in an accident and forces the CM to stop actions against him or he will lie that the CM killed his father for personal vengeance. But the next day at his father's state funeral, Mithran arrests him on the CM's orders.  When Siddharth is arrested, Mithran tells him that the medicine was patented in Manimekalai's name (despite Siddarth being the inventor) and will be made as generic medicine instead of a patent-protected one. It is also revealed that Sengalvarayan is still alive, saved by Mithran and his gang and the public funeral held was for Jana. Mithran makes a deal that he would save Siddharth's life for information and evidence on all of his criminal associates and activities and gives him a bulletproof vest to fake his death during his transport to the court.  They also plan to take down the setup planned by various VIPs to kill Siddharth when one of them gets close to Siddharth, Mithran notices and pushes Siddharth back. To Mithran's surprise, Siddharth does not wear the vest and is fatally shot by Shilpa. Before dying, he tells Mithran that he hid all the evidence in an SD card in the bulletproof vest, adding that he had not done it for the nation but because Mithran had asked for it. The film then happily ends with the wedding of Mahima and Mithran. The last narration was narrated by Mithran on how he became a successful police officer in his life after solving the case (about a boy going to prison for a crime he committed) he read for the first time on the newspaper .  
They Call Me Jeeg
 In a contemporary [[Rome]] stricken by a series of terrorist attacks, Enzo Ceccotti is a thief who lives in Rome's slum, Tor Bella Monaca. One day, he is chased by two policemen for stealing a wristwatch, and in order to escape from them he jumps into the [[Tiber]]. When Enzo tries to get out, he comes into contact with [[radioactive waste]] after he accidentally breaks a submerge barrel. Spending a night of fever, vomiting and cold chills, he wakes up in the morning totally healed, albeit with a persistent cough.  At this point, Enzo decides to sell the watch to Sergio, who works for Fabio Cannizzaro, known as "The Gipsy"; an unstable, crazy gangster with a hunger for fame and a psychopathic predilection for violence. Sergio ends up taking him on a job which is supposed to involve extracting cocaine from inside a pair of extra-communitarian [[drug mule]] brothers. While stopping at Sergio's home, Enzo meets his daughter Alessia, a girl with an apparent psychological disorder who escapes reality by continuously watching the ''[[Steel Jeeg]]'' anime and relating everything to it. When Sergio and Enzo take the drug smugglers to the top of a building under construction, one of them dies from an [[overdose]] due to a cocaine-containing egg breaking in his stomach. After Sergio refuses to take the overdosing brother to a hospital, the other brother grabs Sergio's gun and shoots Sergio. Sergio, before dying, is able to kill the brother, while Enzo falls from the building but incredibly survives.  At home, Enzo discovers he has acquired exceptional strength, the reason for his healing ability. That night, he steals an entire [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] and is filmed by a security camera; the surveillance video goes viral and Enzo is nicknamed as a super-criminal by the press, although no one knows his true identity. Meanwhile, Gipsy discovers that Sergio has not returned with the cocaine yet, which the gang bought from a [[Camorra]] clan led by female boss Nunzia Lo Cosimo, the true author of the attacks in the city. Gipsy must get the cocaine back or pay Nunzia off, so he and his gang invade Sergio's place but only find his daughter Alessia. Enzo comes to her rescue by crushing Gipsy’s posse, and Alessia mistakes him for Hiroshi Shiba, the hero of Steel Jeeg.  Enzo, a reticent, socially isolated and withdrawn ex-felon who wants to lives in solitude, takes Alessia to a [[residential care]] home, where she had previously stayed while her father was in prison. Later, finding information written on a piece of paper hidden in Sergio's spectacle case, Enzo robs the valuable content of an armored truck; the same truck that Gipsy and his gang are about to assault in order to repay the Camorra clan. This increases the infamy of the mystery super-criminal, making Gipsy jealous. Shortly thereafter, two agents of law enforcement bring Alessia to Enzo's house, as they found her wandering on the highway, and Enzo finally decides to take care of her. At night, while Alessia and Enzo are watching a Steel Jeeg episode, Alessia experiences an emotional breakdown, revealing to Enzo that she had suffered sexual abuse in the past.  Gipsy's gang begins to crumble as his best soldier begins to question his leadership and insists that the gang resort to taking money from a local loan-shark in order to pay the debt to Nunzia. Gipsy, aspiring to be a famous and powerful [[crime boss]] and insulted by both his soldier's insolence and the thought of resorting to taking money from a loan-shark, responds by having the soldier mauled to death by his [[rottweiler]]s. However, Gipsy himself nonetheless eventually borrows money from the loan-shark, a Brazilian transsexual named Marcellone. While meeting with Marcellone, Gipsy is attacked by Nunzia and her gang; in the ensuing clash, only Gipsy and Nunzia survive.  Alessia and Enzo become closer, and Enzo begins to develop feelings for her. However, when Enzo has sex with her in the dressing room of a clothes shop, Alessia is reminded of her traumatic past sexual abuse. She becomes angry with Enzo, and in an ensuing argument Enzo reveals to her the truth about her father's death. Alessia flees in anger and boards a trolley, but Enzo, having fallen in love with her, stops the trolley with his superhuman strength, apologizes, and takes Alessia away with him. This is filmed by the passengers, and the videos are seen by Gipsy, who discovers the identity of the famous super-criminal. With the rest of his gang having been killed by Nunzia and her men, the increasingly unhinged Gipsy and his assistant Tazzina kidnap Alessia and Enzo and threaten to kill the captive Alessia unless Enzo reveals how he obtained his powers. Enzo is forced to take Gipsy to the Tiber quay, but at that moment Nunzia arrives with her gang. In the subsequent gunfight Alessia is fatally shot and, in her last moments, asks Enzo to swear to use his powers for good and "save the people". Gipsy is burned alive by Nunzia with a flamethrower and falls into the Tiber waters, apparently dead. The next day, he emerges alive from the river, scarred and burned but with superpowers like Enzo. He goes to Naples and massacres Nunzia and all her gang, filming himself during the act and spreading the video on the web.  After Alessia's death, while wandering alone, Enzo witnesses a traffic accident involving a woman and her young daughter and manages to save the latter from the wreckage of the burning car. Later, Enzo sees Gipsy's video on the news. In the video, Gipsy threatens to set off a bomb in the [[Stadio Olimpico]]. Enzo finds Gipsy at the stadium and the two engage in battle. Unable to defuse the bomb however, Enzo grabs it and throws himself into the Tiber from the Musica-Armando Trovajoli bridge along with Gipsy, who is killed in the explosion.  Enzo, now considered dead and exalted as a hero, watches over Rome from the [[Colosseum]] and, now determined to protect the city, wears the Jeeg mask that Alessia had knitted for him.

Thomas & Friends: The Adventure Begins
  [[Gordon the Big Engine]] is unhappy about having to pull goods trains and tells [[Edward the Blue Engine]] that he won't have to pull them for much longer because [[Sir Topham Hatt]], the railway's director, is hiring a new engine. Later, Gordon becomes stuck at the foot of a steep hill on the main line. With no other engines available, Edward is sent to help Gordon up the hill by pushing the train from behind. Later, Edward is shunting at Knapford Station when he hears [[James the Red Engine|James]] talking to Sir Topham Hatt's new tank engine [[Thomas the Tank Engine|Thomas]]. Gordon is rather skeptical of his size, which upsets Thomas, until Sir Topham arrives and asks Edward to teach him how to work in the yard. Initially, Thomas manages to occasionally get in the way and sometimes causes minor accidents, which Gordon and James seem to sometimes find funny. He also cheekily whistles at Gordon one day while he is resting and wakes him up, much to Gordon's displeasure.  One stormy night at Tidmouth Sheds, Thomas meets [[Henry the Green Engine|Henry]] whom Edward tells the story about the time he hid in a tunnel to get out of the rain. The following day, Thomas is sent to the Sodor Steamworks where he is repainted blue and given the number 1. Gordon explains that the last No. 1 engine was a vertical-boilered engine called a coffee pot and orders Thomas to fetch his express coaches. Thomas accidentally tries to take two four-wheeled coaches called [[Annie and Clarabel]], who belong to James. James later returns Annie and Clarabel to the yard, causing Thomas to notice a burning smell. Later, seeing Henry at the water tower, Thomas asks him about his fear of the rain.  The following day, Thomas takes longer to start than usual and arrives at Knapford with Gordon's coaches later than usual. Still cross with Thomas for waking him up, Gordon starts sooner than expected before Thomas can be uncoupled. By the time Gordon reaches Wellsworth, Thomas is worn out and is uncoupled. Back at Knapford the following day, Thomas meets [[Rolling stock (Thomas & Friends)#Jerome and Judy|Jerome and Judy]], two cranes of the breakdown train while shunting in the yard. James arrives with a goods train and prepares to take Annie and Clarabel, while Thomas again notices the strange burning smell which is coming from James' wooden brake blocks.  The next morning, Henry isn't able to leave Tidmouth Sheds and Thomas, being the only engine left, is instead asked to pull his train. Unfortunately Thomas starts too soon and leaves the coaches behind, much to Sir Topham Hatt's dismay. Thomas sadly returns and is coupled to the train, but Gordon, James, and Henry tease him about it at Tidmouth Sheds later that night. Edward kindly offers to let Thomas take a goods train for him the next day. However, Thomas gets too excited to take Edward's advice about the [[Troublesome Trucks]] which leads him to almost have an accident. Sir Topham Hatt arrives and tells Thomas to learn about freight cars and suggests that he should keep him in the shed if Thomas is not prepared to learn. He then orders Thomas and Edward to stay in the yard until Thomas knows enough about freight cars as Edward does. During this time, Thomas manages to help Henry overcome his fear of rain.  A year later, Thomas and Edward are working when a frightened James rushes by because the Troublesome Trucks are pushing him and causes his wooden brake blocks to catch fire. Thomas attempts to couple up behind James' train to slow him down, but the trucks' speed and weight cause James to derail on a bend before Thomas can couple up. Thomas returns to Knapford and fetches Jerome and Judy to rescue James who he takes to the Steamworks. Later that night, everyone congratulates Thomas; even Sir Topham Hatt who announces that after a couple repairs, James will have proper brakes and a new coat of paint and Thomas, due to his unselfish bravery and heroism, will have his own branch line. Everyone is happy for Thomas, except Gordon who asks who will fetch their coaches because tender engines don't shunt. Sir Topham says the other engines will have to fetch their own coaches until he finds another small engine who can.  A few days later, James returns to the yard with new brakes and a fresh coat of red paint and Thomas is given Annie and Clarabel to run his branch line. Arriving at Ffarquhar Station, he meets [[Railway engines (Thomas & Friends)#Glynn|Glynn]] the coffee pot engine who asks him to look after the branch line and wear the number one with pride. During the end credits, various scenes from the "Railway Series" books are shown as the song "Really Useful Engine" plays.  
Thomas & Friends: Sodor's Legend of the Lost Treasure
 One day at Knapford Station, Thomas causes Gordon's express to fly off the tracks by accident while trying to disprove Gordon about "silly" tank engines, then Topham sends Thomas to the construction yard as punishment. At the site, the ground beneath the tracks begin to crumble and some engineers deem it unsafe. Meanwhile, at Arlesburgh Junction, the small engines burst into song to cheer Thomas up, but at the yard, he eagerly rolls over the track as it gives way for a large gap, his flatbeds pulling him into getting badly scratched. He sees, however, an old abandoned pirate ship inside and, when lifted out, he tries to tell Sir Topham Hatt about it, while an elderly man watches Thomas with his telescope.   The next night, Thomas suddendly wakes from and follows a sailboat flowing down the line. Just outside the sinkhole, Thomas accidentally makes himself be heard, and sailor John and sailboat Skiff introduce themselves. Thomas soon agrees to help find the treasure and lowers sailor John into the cavern, where the map is found. Late next morning, after badly chosen coal, sparks from Ryan's funnel light his dynamite, which him and some other engines pass around before Thomas shunts the trucks into the cavern, right before it explodes. Thomas is congratulated by others, but Sir Topham Hatt is furious, due to the scenario that Thomas was chasing Ryan with dynamite. Fed up with Thomas refusing to let him his own up mistakes, and having so much caused confusion and delay, Sir Topham Hatt sends Thomas to his shed for disgrace. That afternoon the diggers tried to dig out, but without the dynamite, they went to get some sleep, but while Marion finds a chest within the cliffside.  That night, Thomas agrees to help them again to find the treasure, but soon gets accused of finding it first. An upset Thomas bumps into Marion, who drops the chest onto him, revealing the treasure. Passing through Knapford, Thomas overhears Topham on the telephone, saying the treasure will be in his office overnight. That night, Thomas soon sleeps in wait just outside the station, when John blows up the safe and takes the treasure. The explosion wakes Thomas up, who begins pursuing him. To keep up with the two, Thomas has to race through a red signal and towards a hill, where he finds the pirate ship, set rolling down ahead.   As the morning sun rises, John tries multiple ways to stop Thomas, but then Skiff encourages Thomas to derail him. Thomas accidentally sends him down a wrong line, but soon notices that his line crosses over Skiff's - which runs into the sea. Thomas slips into it and rests atop of Skiff's chassis, while John sails away, despite Skiff asking him to throw off the heavy treasure, which an huge wave later sinks to the bottom of the sea. Later that morning, the police turns up and arrests John. Upon seeing Sir Topham Hatt, Thomas tries to apologize, but Sir Topham Hatt is proud of his heroism, which Ryan told him all about. At last, the construction is complete. Thomas leads the other engines down the new branch line, meeting up with Skiff again, who is now carrying out railboat tours to visitors, while the Divers recover the treasure.

While demonstrating it, he accidentally shoots her in the leg. An unspecified time later, Kelly sneaks into Mark's house through his second-story window and confront him on why he has not contacted her lately. Mark reveals that his parents have grounded him and taken away his mobile phone after finding a condom and drugs among his possessions. Lynn, Mark's mother, interrupts them. As Kelly hides, she overhears Lynn insult her, calling her low class and unworthy of Mark.  After Lynn leaves, Kelly tells Mark she is pregnant. Upset, Mark complains his life plans could be ruined. Before they can discuss it further, Mark hears a loud thump. Unknown to Mark, home invaders have killed his dog and taken his parents hostage. He leaves his room to investigate, and Kelly hears further noises. Panicking, she hides under Mark's bed. The bedroom door bursts open, and robbers Shane, Callum, Sveta, and Reg enter. Shane has a glass shard embedded in his side, and they set him down on the bed. He instructs the others to stick to their plan: Reg and Sveta are to take Mark's father, Doug, to his bank and rob it while Callum and Shane watch the hostages.  As Callum researches how to make a tourniquet on Mark's computer, Kelly desperately reaches for a cell phone, only to find its battery is dead. Callum becomes excited when he learns Lynn is a doctor, and he temporarily frees her so she can look at Shane.

The Throne (film)
 The film opens with the crown prince, Sado, carrying out a plot to kill his father, the king.  However, the assassination - for untold reasons - does not take place.    The next day, Sado's mother goes to the king to encourage him not to punish Sado's son when he punishes Sado.  The king summons Sado and tells him to kill himself.  Fearing for their own lives, Sado's supporters rush in and save him from suicide.  Instead the king orders Sado into a large rice box, which he then nails shut since no one else will do it for him.  The movie procedes to flip back and forth chronologically between the rice box in the courtyard and the history of how it got there.    The king is presented as a doting father very concerned with the educational attainments of his young son.  Sado is presented as winsome and diplomatic even at a very early age.  However, he does not take well to the rote memorization he is expected to perform.  He fails to properly acquire a passage written by his father, and we find him preferring to socialize and paint.  When asked how often he likes to study, all are shocked with his very frank answer of "once or twice a year."  The king perceives his son is being rebellious.  Meanwhile, three days in the box Sado begins to hallucinate.  He imagines he is covered by centipedes and breaks out of the box, washing himself in the pond.  He is returned to the box, which is then fortified.  In another flashback, the king describes familial relations among royalty being different from commoners.  "In the palace, parents think of their children as enemies."  Sado's father goes on to tell how his father had his wife poisoned, and he himself has been accused of killing his own brother to secure the throne.  Here and at other places during the movie he claims he does not want to be the king, but his duplicity is palpable.   The king proposes his son be made a substitute king, a method by which the crown prince may exercise the office of king under the ongoing tutelage of the elderly king.  In his new role, Sado is assertive and just, but some factions that have enjoyed special privilege under the corrupt elder king take issue with his rulings.  The elder king jumps to the conclusion that his son is capitalizing on schisms within the kingdom to weaken the elder king's powers.  He directs his son to make fewer decisions and allow the nobles to lead.  However, when his son defers to them, the king is alarmed at the decisions of his nobles and countermands Sado's rulings.  Then Sado begins to consult his father to make wiser decisions, but the old man ridicules his son for being unable to govern independently.  Nothing Sado does is pleasing to the king, who proceeds to humiliate his son.  However, the Royal Queen Dowager is overjoyed at Sado's wisdom and acts as his protector.  When the king refuses to call for celebrations for the queen's 60th birthday, the tension comes to a head.  He storms into her chambers and insists that she support him or approve his stepping down.  Much to his shock, she approves, thereby making Sado king.  Curiously, Sado refuses to ascend the throne.  After the elderly king's departure, Sado remains kneeling in the courtyard where his subjects fear he will die of exposure.  The queen is forced to revoke her approval, and in humiliation, she stops eating, bringing her life to an end.  At her funeral, the elder king blames Sado for her death.  Sado snaps.  Sado becomes a religious zealot and an alcoholic.  He digs an underground grave complex for himself and refuses to pay his respects to the new queen.  In a rage, he kills one of the palace eunuchs.  He throws a celebration for his mother for her 60th birthday at which his actions imply madness.  Meanwhile, the elder king takes on Sado's son as his new protege, but has his own son framed for plotting a conspiracy against the crown.  The scene from the beginning is replayed with a few additions, the important one being why he did not kill his father.  At the critical moment, he found his son with his grandfather and overheard his son tell his grandfather that Sado had a good heart.  Sado did not go through with the assassination.  Sado dies on the seventh day of his imprisonment and is buried on the eighth, but his father has all memory of him erased.  He directs his grandson never to even speak his name.  However, after the death of the elder king, Sado's son goes out of his way to honour his father, thereby vindicating Sado.

The Throwaways (film)
 When the infamous hacker Drew Reynolds is captured by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], he is faced with a choice. Either to spend his life in jail or work for them. Reynolds agrees to work for the CIA should he be able to form his own squad team called the "Throwaways", this team was seen as expendable and deemed the worst in the whole organisation.  The film opens with [[lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf]] patriot blackjack hacker Drew Reynolds living in solitude and doing what he does best: hacking anyone he feels is a threat to the America and the free world, including various jihadist and other terrorist organizations and straw militia groups.  His friend in cybersecurity, Erik, alerts him that the CIA has tracked him down and though he manages to briefly elude them, he is captured.  Upon meeting with him, Agents Holden (a former mentor of Drew) and Connelly offer him a deal: spend 30 years to life in prison or work for them to catch an even greater threat. An unidentified hacker has somehow managed to tap into Chicago's power grid using a volatile program known as "Pantheon" and shut it down completely thanks to a special encryption key that allows him access to the entire Internet and World Wide Web and beyond. If this device gets into the wrong hands, the entire world will be at the mercy of any number of terrorists, most likely the highest bidder. Offered a deal where he could forego a possible life sentence if he agrees to use his expertise to locate this hacker, Drew accepts in exchange for total immunity on one condition: he picks the team of experts he will be working with.  Over the reservations of Connelly and Holden, Drew picks three agents who had been deemed as "Throwaways" based on their lack of success or other factors: Dan Fisher, a short tempered and violence-prone ex-agent who's been relegated to basement duty; Gloria Miller, a "swallow" agent who successfully seduces her marks but is nonetheless not taken seriously by her cohorts; and Dmitri Stanislav, a cowardly ex-KGB Russian with a history of deserting his comrades (including Fisher at one point) on dangerous missions. As the mission progresses the team are able to learn that the hacker in question is Teebs, a young anarchist who intends to sell the key on the black market to the highest bidder, who ends up being a pro-Soviet Russian defector named Olag Constantin. It is also revealed that Drew faked the algorithm process by which he chose his team; he simply read their files and selected them based on their shoddy records hoping that the mission would end in failure.  With his immunity deal having already been signed, Drew could then go back to working alone. The others discover this following an assassination attempt on Holden, after which Connelly disbands the team but commends them for proving far more successful than he'd previously thought they would be. Furious, Fisher, Gloria, and Dmitri leave in a huff.  Shortly after, a failed raid to apprehend Teebs's and Constantin's broker results in Connelly and his team being killed. Drew has Erik pull up everything he can on Teebs while at the same time, Holden identifies one of the assassins who murdered Connelly and his team as Bes, a [[chameleon]] agent posing as Teebs's girlfriend who is under Constantin's employ. Shortly afterward, Teebs reactivates Pantheon at Constantin's order, causing Bulgaria to experience total blackout. Thanks to Erik's help, Drew is able locate Teebs and after an apology followed by a rousing pep talk, he and Holden are able to convince their former team members to return and finish the mission.  Once the team is back together, they sneak into Constantin's headquarters. Drew finds Teebs and tries to convince him to hand over the key. Teebs attacks him instead, but drops the key when Drew shoots him, destroying it and forcing Drew to bypass the hardwired encryption in order to restore Bulgaria's power and prevent a lethal gas valve failure. Gloria, Fisher, and Dmitri take on Constantin and his men in a lengthy and caper-filled confrontation. Gloria manages to kill Bes while Dmitri and Fisher are able to take out Constantin and the soldiers with an RPG launcher.  Their mission a success, Drew is made an official CIA agent under Holden's command and is teamed up with the now fully reestablished agents before they eagerly head out on their next mission.  Meanwhile, a post-credits scene shows Teebs retrieving another Pantheon key from a strongbox in an unknown location.

 An adult Frank Walker talks to an unseen group about the future, beginning with his visit to the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] as a child. In a flashback, he meets David Nix, an official who is unimpressed with Frank's prototype personal jet pack. Frank does draw the attention of a young girl named Athena. Athena gives Frank a pin embossed with a "T" symbol and tells him to follow her aboard the "[[It's a Small World]]" attraction. Frank sneaks onto the ride, where his pin transports him to a futuristic cityscape known as Tomorrowland. Frank then passes the narration to teenager Casey Newton, from whose point of view the majority of the story proceeds, starting in more current time.  Casey is seen sneaking into a decommissioned NASA launch pad in Florida, where her father Eddie is an engineer. She sabotages the cranes dismantling the pad and returns home, where Athena, who hasn't aged since 1964, sneaks a "T" pin into Casey's belongings. The next night, Casey returns to the pad, but is arrested. At the police station, she sees the pin among her personal items, and discovers that upon contact, the pin instantly shows her a view of Tomorrowland. She briefly explores the vision until the pin's battery runs out.  Assisted by her brother Nate, Casey finds and visits a Houston memorabilia store related to the pin. The store's owners, Hugo and Ursula, question where she got the pin, then attack her when she says she knows nothing else. Athena bursts in and fights Hugo and Ursula, who are revealed to be [[Audio-Animatronics|Audio-Animatronic]] (AA) robots. The girls escape as the severly damaged AA robots self-destruct. After stealing a car, Athena reveals that she is an AA robot, and the one who gave Casey the pin, stating that she needs Casey's help to save the world. Athena drives Casey to Frank's home in [[Pittsfield, New York]] and leaves her there.  The reclusive Frank declines Casey's request for an audience, but she manages to lure him out of the house and sneak in, locking him out. Frank re-enters through a tunnel and tells her angrily that he was thrown out of Tomorrowland and cannot go back. He also asks if she would like to know the exact moment of her death. Casey ponders whether accepting the truth about her time of death would actually be the cause of it, preferring to make her own destiny. When she says this, a monitor showing the probability of the end of the world changes from 100% to 99.9994%, startling Frank. AA robot agents appear, ordering Frank to turn over Casey or be killed.  After evading the AAs and reuniting with Athena, the trio uses a machine that Frank invented to teleport to the Eiffel Tower. They enter a room with mannequins of [[Gustave Eiffel]], [[Jules Verne]], [[Nikola Tesla]], and [[Thomas Edison]]. Frank explains that the four men were founders of ''Plus Ultra'' in the 19th century, dedicated to finding other dreamers and inventors who shared the hope of shaping a better future, which eventually led them to discover a new dimension where they founded Tomorrowland. The trio enter a rocket hidden underneath the tower, which launches into space and travels to another dimension, arriving at a now-desolate Tomorrowland. Nix greets them and takes them to a building linked to a [[tachyon]] machine designed by Frank that can show images from the past and future. Casey learns that a worldwide catastrophe will soon happen in her time. Casey does not accept that the world is destined to end, again causing the outlook to flicker, though Nix ignores it and orders them arrested.  Casey realizes that the tachyon machine is telling humanity that the world is coming to an end, causing a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]. Nix prefers to interpret it as the device effectively warned humanity, who didn't bother making an effort to save themselves. Nix opens a return portal to an uninhabited tropical island, where Frank and Casey can live out the last few days of the world. Frank finally refuses to believe that things can't change and fights Nix, sending Casey and Athena to use a bomb to blow up the machine. The bomb is accidentally thrown through the portal to the uninhabited island, with the explosion pinning Nix's leg under debris in Tomorrowland. When Nix retrieves a plasma gun and aims at Frank, Athena jumps in front of him and is damaged beyond repair, which activates her self-destruct sequence. In her last moments of consciousness, Athena instructs Frank to use her imminent explosion to destroy the machine, then reveals that she had grown beyond her programming and fallen in love with him. Her explosion destroys the machine and kills Nix.  Back in the present, Frank and Casey are revealed to be in Tomorrowland, with Casey's father and brother. Their audience is a group of AAs like Athena, who are given new "T" pins and instructed to bring other dreamers to Tomorrowland in order to save the world.

After Erick agrees to pay them for their services, Burt and Travis head to Africa to hunt down the creatures. During the trip, Burt befriends their pilot, Dan Bravers. Upon arrival, Burt's heavy weaponry is impounded due to South African gun laws. Dreyer proudly displays his rhino-tranquilizer rifle but Burt explains that all Graboids are immune to tranquilizers, so he and Travis are instead equipped with a small collection of guns that Van Wyk has gathered. Burt takes the guns but protests that their calibre is far too small to hunt Graboids. They set up their quarters at an animal refuge, where Travis befriends a little girl named Amahle Montabu and meets her mother Nandi who Travis falls for, but starts a rivalry with a worker named Baruti, who is also in love with Nandi. Meanwhile, at a dig site, two paleontologists celebrate after finding the fossilized remains of a Graboid, but they are attacked and eaten. Investigating the scene, Burt sees the fossil and realizes that it is a different breed of Graboid.  That night, Travis attends a local tribal dance with Nandi. At the refuge, a worker named Thaba is attacked by an Ass-Blaster that carries him away. Burt orders the refuge to be evacuated and reprimands Travis for his absence. He then heads out with Erick and Dreyer to hunt the Ass-Blaster. They find it in a cave, and the Ass-Blaster attacks them. Burt kills it, but Dreyer is killed. After Burt finds that the Ass-Blasters have been laying Graboid eggs, Erick reveals himself to be a poacher, planning to sell the eggs on the [[black market]]. He knocks Burt out, locks him in the metal cage, and leaves with the eggs. Travis arrives to rescue Burt the next day, but the truck's fuel line is broken by a rock, so they head back to the refuge on foot.  In the desert, Burt and Travis find Erick's truck crashed, with Erick fleeing from a massive Graboid with detachable and independent tentacles, which Burt dubs "The Queen Bitch". Burt shoots the tentacles, but the Queen Bitch eats Erick. Burt agrees to let Travis go back in the cave alone and use a recovered grenade on the nest, while he contacts Dan for transport and back-up. In the cave, Travis encounters a guarding Ass-Blaster which he kills with the grenade, but fails to destroy the nest. When Dan arrives, Burt manages to use his helicopter's rockets to destroy the nest. Dan flies the two back their truck and helps repair the damage. Afterwards, Travis reveals to Burt that he is Burt's son, the child of a one-night stand back in [[Florida]]; having heard of Burt's exploits, Travis wanted to be like his father.  At the refuge, the workers are attacked by Ass-Blasters. Nandi, Amahle, and Baruti manage to kill several Ass-Blasters and a graboid and escape. They head for the village, where they discover that Amahle is hiding a Graboid egg, which was why the creatures were singling out the refuge for attack. Arriving at the village's gas station, the trio is attacked again and during the confusion, Amahle wanders away with the egg. Burt and Travis arrive, finding the village under siege by the Queen Bitch's tentacles. Travis retrieves the egg, and Baruti gets Amahle to safety. They shoot the tentacles, but the Queen Bitch arrives. Nandi suggests using the daily thunderstorm to kill it. Travis distracts it as the villagers construct a trap. When the storm erupts, Nandi lures the Queen Bitch in with the egg. Burt, Nandi, and Baruti attack it with their weapons before lightning bolts attracted by the trap strike, destroying the egg and then the graboid.  Afterwards, Burt accepts Travis as his son, inviting him to join him in his work.

In New York City, Michael Finkel ([[Jonah Hill]]) is an ambitious and successful reporter. He is confronted by his editors about a story he has written and has featured on the cover of the ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'', who accuse him of using a [[composite character]] as the focus of his story, a violation of basic reporting principles. Finkel briefly attempts to defend his actions, but he is unsuccessful and is fired. He returns home to his wife ([[Felicity Jones]]), and struggles to find work as a journalist due to his public firing from the ''Times.''  Finkel is contacted by a reporter for ''[[The Oregonian]]'', who is seeking his opinion on Christian Longo's theft of his identity. Finkel, who was not aware of Longo's case at all, is intrigued, and arranges to meet with Longo in prison. During their first conversation, Longo claims that he has followed Finkel for his entire career and always admired his writing. Longo agrees to tell Finkel his side of the crimes he is accused of, in exchange for writing lessons and Finkel's promise not to share their conversations until after the conclusion of the murder trial.  Finkel becomes increasingly absorbed with Longo, who is likeable but evasive about his guilt. Convinced that the story will be redemptive, Finkel visits Longo in prison and corresponds with him for several months. Longo sends Finkel numerous letters as well as an eighty-page notebook entitled "Wrong Turns", which contains what Longo describes as a list of every mistake he has made in his life. Finkel begins to recognize similarities between Longo and himself, their handwriting and drawing, and Longo's letters and Finkel's personal journals. As the trial approaches, Finkel grows increasingly doubtful that Longo is guilty of the murders, and Longo informs Finkel he intends changing his plea to not guilty.  In court, Longo pleads not guilty to two of the murders, but pleads guilty to the murder of his wife and one of his daughters. Finkel confronts Longo, who claims that he can not share everything he knows because he has to protect certain individuals, whom he refuses to name. Greg Ganley ([[Robert John Burke]]), the detective who tracked Longo down and arrested him, approaches Finkel, and claims that Longo is an extremely dangerous and manipulative man. He tries to convince Finkel to turn over as evidence all of his correspondence with Longo. Finkel refuses and Ganley does not press him for an explanation.  At the trial, Longo takes the stand and describes his version of the events in detail. He claims that, after an argument with his wife about their financial situation, he had come home to discover two of his children missing, one of his daughters unconscious, and his wife sobbing, saying that she put the children "in the water". Longo says that he strangled his wife to death in a blind rage. He says he thought his other daughter was dead at first, but then realized that she was still breathing and strangled her as well because she was all but dead. Finkel's wife, Jill, watches Longo's testimony.  As the jury deliberates, Jill visits Longo in jail and tells him that he is a narcissistic murderer who will never escape who he is.  Longo is found guilty of all four charges and sentenced to death. After he is sentenced, he winks at Finkel, who to his shock and rage, realizes that Longo has been lying throughout their conversations, using him in order to make his testimony more believable. A short time later, Finkel meets Longo on death row. Longo tries to convince Finkel that he discovered his wife strangling their daughter and then blacked out, so that he has no memory of the murders. Finkel angrily tells Longo that he will not believe any more of his lies and will warn the judge when Longo appeals his sentence of Longo's manipulative nature. Longo retorts by pointing out the success Finkel has had with his book about their encounters, leaving the reporter shaken.  Finkel reads a section of his book, entitled ''True Story'', at a promotional event in a bookstore. Taking questions from the audience, he imagines Longo standing in the back of the room. Longo says that, if he has lost his freedom, Finkel must have lost something as well. Finkel is unable to respond.  Title cards reveal that Longo admitted, a year later, to killing his entire family. Although Finkel never wrote for the "New York Times" again, Longo has contributed articles to a number of publications from death row, including the "New York Times." The final title card reads that Finkel and Longo still speak on the first Sunday of every month.  
Truth (2015 film)
 In the months before the US [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], [[Mary Mapes]] (producer of the primetime news program ''[[60 Minutes Wednesday]]'') and her crew consisting of Mike Smith (Grace), Lucy Scott (Moss), and Colonel Roger Charles (Quaid) are seeking evidence to verify whether or not George W. Bush received any preferential treatment during his time in the military. Charles, knowing that the military "is good at what they do," believes there were no mistakes or errors, despite some claims that Bush's records were lost or altered, and that Bush had difficulty meeting minimal physical aptitude testing. Seeking leads, Mapes and her crew eventually find Bill Burkett, who says he has [[Killian documents controversy|hard evidence]] in the form of memos and letters dictating that Bush did indeed have preferential treatment. Mapes produces a story that [[Dan Rather]] reports on ''60 Minutes''.  After the airing, Mapes and Rather face questions over the accuracy of the segment. The core documents on which these allegations were based were immediately called into question by a variety of sources, with some indicating the documents as being forgeries, which was then investigated and amplified by various talk radio hosts, bloggers and numerous mainstream media sources, including ''The Washington Post'' and ''CBS'' itself.  They easily found that certain characteristics of the memos, such as its font and letter spacing, indicated the memos were created on a computer using [[Microsoft Word]], and therefore could not have been typed on a typewriter in the early 1970s.<ref name="ebert">[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/truth-2015 Truth movie review], [[RogerEbert.com]], October 16, 2015.</ref> Subsequently, Burkett, who produced the documents, admitted that he had lied about where he had obtained them.<ref name=Atlantic>Orr, Christopher.

One by one they are forced to face an internal review panel to determine whether or not political bias was a factor in the report. Smith, Scott, and Charles are eventually banned from their work and subsequently fired, with Smith going on a rant in the office before being escorted out. Rather faces the music, and decides that after the hearing he will retire from broadcasting. While Mapes faces the board, she comes under heavy fire about her agenda in connection with the segment. Mapes stands up for herself and presents the evidence from her point of view. After the hearing, Mapes is fired and Rather makes her last broadcast, citing how courage helped her and her crew get through the toughest of times.  
Trumbo (2015 film)
 [[Dalton Trumbo]] is a screenwriter whose talent places him among the elite of Hollywood. However, his active membership in the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party of the USA]] draws the contempt of staunchly [[Anti-Sovietism|anti-Soviet]] entertainment-industry figures such as columnist [[Hedda Hopper]] and actor [[John Wayne]].  Trumbo is one of [[Hollywood Ten|10 screenwriters]] subpoenaed to testify before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC) regarding alleged [[Communist propaganda]] in Hollywood films. They refuse to directly answer questions, confident that a liberal majority on the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] will overturn the convictions for [[contempt of Congress]]. Trumbo's friend [[Edward G. Robinson]], who supports the cause, sells the ''[[Portrait of Père Tanguy]]'' to raise money for their legal defense fund. The unexpected deaths of Justices [[Wiley Blount Rutledge|Wiley Rutledge]] and [[Frank Murphy]] ruin Trumbo's plan to appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In 1950, Trumbo serves 11 months in [[Federal Correctional Institution, Ashland|Federal Correctional Institution in Ashland, Kentucky]].  As the [[Hollywood Blacklist]] expands to exclude more communists and communist sympathizers from working in the industry, Trumbo and his comrades are abandoned by Robinson and producer Buddy Ross, who disavow them to protect their careers. Trumbo is released from prison, but he remains blacklisted and his finances – and family life – become increasingly strained. He resorts to giving the screenplay for ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' to his friend [[Ian McLellan Hunter]], to take credit and a share of the money, and eventually the [[Academy Award for Best Story]]. Selling his idyllic lakeside home and moving to a house in the city, he goes to work as a pseudonymous screenwriter for the low-budget [[King Brothers Productions]], also farming out the writing of [[B-movie]] screenplays to fellow blacklisted writers. He puts his wife Cleo and teenage children to work as his support staff, adding to domestic conflict. King Brothers' film ''[[The Brave One (1956 film)|The Brave One]]'', an original story by Trumbo under a pseudonym, receives an Academy Award he cannot claim. His blacklisted friend Arlen Hird dies from cancer, destitute, but an attempt by Hedda Hopper's [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals|allies]] to intimidate the head of King Brothers to fire Trumbo fails completely.  Over time, industry suspicion of Trumbo's ghostwriting develops, but he is careful not to confirm it. In 1960, actor [[Kirk Douglas]] recruits him to write the screenplay for his epic film ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', and director [[Otto Preminger]] recruits him to script ''[[Exodus (1960 film)|Exodus]]''. Both men publicly credit him as the screenwriter, despite Hopper's futile efforts to intimidate Douglas into dropping Trumbo. By 1960, the effectiveness of the Blacklist has been broken to the point where newly elected [[President of the United States|US President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] publicly endorses ''Spartacus'', and Trumbo and others are able to begin rebuilding their careers. Ten years later, finally receiving his due accolades from Hollywood, Trumbo speaks about how the Blacklist victimized them all: those who stood by their principles and lost their jobs, and also those who compromised their principles to keep them.

He hardly earns anything despite his toil since he never takes money from anyone for his services, often menial jobs, asked to him to be done by the people of his locality and the crew of the film production unit. Lakshmi ([[Kristina Akheeva]]), a psychology student takes interest in him after she learns about Naanu, which translates to 'I', (played by Upendra in the prequel ''[[Upendra (film)|Upendra]]'', who eventually becomes Neenu in ''Uppi 2'') from her professor. Her constant pursuit of him eventually leads to his discovery. Moved by his happy, unblemished and selfless personality, she eventually falls in love with him. Yet she fails to take him out of his strange world of selflessness.  Meanwhile, Saleem (Shobhraj), an underworld don based in [[Dubai]], aided by his trusted aide ''Malpe Bala'' and his henchmen, has been in constant quest of finding Neenu, regarding a property worth hundreds of crores belonging to a widow, Mandakini, who has become a follower of an [[aghori]],  Neenu (before posing as the humble Neenu). The aghori is also being shown exploiting Sheela ([[Parul Yadav]]) who comes seeking spiritual advice after being dejected in love.  Simultaneously, Neenu is seen being chased by top cop [[Sayaji Shinde]] who tries to find him and embezzle the property. Unknown about this, sleuths of the [[Crime Investigation Department (India)]] interpret Neenu as an [[Undercover operation|undercover agent]] trying to nab the most wanted fugitive don, Saleem.   Neenu finally manages to subdue his chasers by instigating the cops against the goons and grips with Lakshmi. It becomes apparent that Mandakini is a fictional character imagined by the cops and Neenu is just a normal man. The [[Will and testament|will]] made by Mandakini of her property gives a philosophical view that when one stops saying ''Naanu'' or Me, which symbolizes fear, anger, jealousy and selfishness; holds to ''Neenu'' or You, which symbolizes gratitude, kindness, selflessness; and when one stops thinking about the past and the future, will happiness (''khushi''), the 'daughter' of ''Mandakini'' (calmness in the heart) would stay with him forever.

He has a daughter Manonmani ([[Parvathy (actress)|Parvathy]]) who was born out of wedlock to Yamini and was raised by Yamini's husband Jacob Zachariah ([[Jayaram (actor)|Jayaram]]) after Yamini's death. She also despises Manoranjan. He has been diagnosed with [[cancer staging|advanced stage]] [[brain cancer]] and has only a few more months to live, which is unknown to anyone including his own family. He is treated by his family doctor Dr. Arpana ([[Andrea Jeremiah]]), with whom he has an [[extramarital affair]].  One day, Manoranjan decides to withdraw from a film produced by Poornachandra Rao and instead act in a film produced by himself and directed by Margadarsi ([[K. Balachander]]), who was his mentor with whom he had fallen out when he married Varalakshmi and started acting in films directed and produced by Poornachandra Rao, who is a sworn enemy of Margadarsi. Despite their personal differences, Manoranjan wants Margadarsi to be the director of his last film before he dies. Margadarsi initially refuses to direct Manoranjan, but when he hears from Arpana about Manoranjan's terminal illness, he becomes moved and accepts to direct Manoranjan. When Poornachandra Rao and Varalakshmi find out about Manoranjan's plan, they get enraged and leave his house along with Manohar. Undaunted, Manoranjan goes ahead with his film.  Manoranjan's film with Margadarsi is titled ''Uttama Villain''.

This leads to a rapproachment with Poornachandra Rao (and also between Margadarsi and Poornachandra Rao) and a father-son bonding with Manohar. Varalakshmi, on the other hand, suffers a [[heart attack]] on hearing the news, though she soon recovers. She apologises to Manoranjan for her actions to forcibly separate him from Yamini so that she could marry him. Later, Manoranjan finds out that a letter he had written to Yamini shortly after they had separated, had not been delivered to her. When Manonmani reads this letter, which tells about Manoranjan's support for Yamini's decision to not undergo an [[abortion]] despite being pregnant out of wedlock, her hatred towards her biological father turns to love and she finally accepts him as her father.  After completing the shooting of ''Uttama Villain'', Manoranjan becomes very sick, suffering from [[delirium]] as well as slurred speech and movement, and faints. He is immediately rushed to hospital. Margadarsi completes editing the film and plays it in the hospital. The people present in the hospital, including all the loved ones of Manoranjan, enjoy the film, which ends with Uttaman killing Muttharasan in a stage drama (Iraniya Naadagam), thus dodging death yet again.

When Shane uses Max's real name, the others exasperatedly remove their masks, reasoning that their cover has been blown.  They force Emma to record a ransom demand for her wealthy father.  She reveals she has not spoken to her father in several years and calls her kidnappers incompetent amateurs.  Afterward, she warns the men that her father will likely not pay the ransom, but when he calls them back, Jack threatens to kill Emma unless he does.  Shane, Jack's war buddy from Iraq, drives them to a motel, where they stash Emma.  While they are in their rooms, Mexican cartel hit men search the van and recognize the name of the owner as a possible hit they performed, though they are not sure.  Jack surprises them, kills one, and questions the other.  Jack learns they tracked the kidnappers through Emma's cell phone and that Carlos, Emma's father and a major cartel boss, has no intention of paying the ransom.  After executing the remaining hit man, he quickly gathers the others, and they flee the motel.  Jack explains he never intended to collect the ransom but instead suspects that Carlos killed both Emma's mother and his father, who were having an affair.  As evidence, he shows a ring to Emma, who verifies that it belongs to her father.  Shane, a drug addict desperate for money, protests against what he believes to be a suicide mission, but Max agrees to follow through the new plan.  Before they can reach the agreed upon checkpoint, a cop stops them.  Max, suspicious that the cop is on to them, murders him, causing Shane to believe that Max is an unreliable psychopath.  Max also confesses to being the carjacker who killed Jasmine's previous boyfriend, as he wanted to give Jack a better chance at a relationship with Jasmine.  When they next stop, Shane, unnerved by Max's confession, secretly proposes an alliance with Emma.  Emma draws Jack and Max out of the van when she says she must urinate, and Shane searches the vehicle for a weapon.  Max returns just as Shane breaks a shotgun out of its lock box.  Max taunts Shane and says that it takes a psychopath to recognize one; Shane agrees, and pulls the trigger.  Max taunts him further when it becomes obvious Shane did not load the weapon.  Enraged, Shane stabs Max to death, then explains to Jack that Max attacked him.  Shane uses the empty shotgun to disarm Jack, and he drives off with Emma, who agrees that Jack's revenge plot is doomed.  After driving a short distance, Shane reveals that he has PTSD and used heroin to calm his nerves, as he was prone to fits of violence against women.  As Emma becomes increasingly nervous, he grows more aggressive, eventually revealing that he is a serial rapist.  As he prepares to assault her, she fights back and wounds him with a power tool left in the van.  After Shane stabs her in retaliation, Jack reappears after Emma kills Shane.  Emma drives to the checkpoint, where she meets with her father and explains that she has killed all the kidnappers herself.  When she demands an explanation from her father, he finally admits to killing Jack's father and Emma's mother.  Together, Emma and Jack, who was hiding, kill Carlos, then defeat his cartel henchmen, though Jack dies of his wounds.  Bloodied and injured, Emma pushes Jack's body from the van and drives off.  
The Vatican Tapes
 In the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], Vicar Imani ([[Djimon Hounsou]]) shows [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] Bruun ([[Peter Andersson (actor)|Peter Andersson]]) the case of Angela Holmes ([[Olivia Taylor Dudley]]), a young American woman who is suspected of harboring an evil spirit.  Three months earlier in the [[United States]], Angela is given a surprise birthday party by her father, Roger ([[Dougray Scott]]), and boyfriend, Peter "Pete" Smith ([[John Patrick Amedori]]). While slicing her cake, she cuts herself and is rushed to the hospital, where she briefly meets with Father Lozano ([[Michael Peña]]). She is injected with a serum [[Malpractice|that causes an infection]]; at home, she experiences a seizure and is placed under care at a hospital. A few days later, Angela is released, but on the way, she violently takes the wheel, causing an accident that puts her in a [[coma]] for 40 days. Just as her life support is about to be switched off, Angela comes round, seemingly in perfect health.  However, Angela begins to show symptoms of [[demonic possession]] when she almost drowns a baby, followed by forcing a detective (Jarvis W. George) to commit suicide. Lozano chooses to send her to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. A distraught Roger then confesses that Angela's mother was a [[prostitute]]; she was pregnant just a few months after Roger met her before she abruptly left, implying that Roger merely adopted Angela. Angela's possession becomes even worse as she frequently sleepwalks, taunts her psychiatrist, Dr. Richards ([[Kathleen Robertson]]), eventually culminating in her speaking in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] that induces hysteria and mass suicide in her fellow patients. Deciding that nothing can save her, the hospital releases her.  The movie returns to the timeframe of the prologue. Bruun concludes that Angela is possessed by the [[Antichrist]] due to the presence of the crows around her, which are agents of [[Satan]], and instructs Imani to stay back while he personally heads to the United States to cure Angela. An exorcism he plans involves a [[Eucharist]], where Angela reacts by vomiting blood and spitting three eggs, meant to symbolize a perverted [[Trinity]]. Bruun also comments that her birth from a prostitute perverts the virgin birth of Jesus Christ. Bruun then realizes that the Antichrist is already a part of Angela; killing him would mean Angela's death as well. However, just after Bruun kills Angela, she rises up as the resurrected Antichrist, mirroring the [[Resurrection of Jesus]], and proceeds to kill Bruun, Roger, and Pete. She spares Lozano, though, and tells him to inform the Vatican that the Antichrist is roaming the Earth.  Three months later, Lozano, having been released from the hospital, visits the Vatican and is allowed access to the [[Vatican Secret Archives|archives]] by Imani. He is shown footage of what has happened since: Angela returns as the only "survivor" of the exorcism besides Lozano and is now performing miracles to gather followers. The film ends with Angela entering a large room to greet her followers by [[Crucifixion|stretching out her arms]].

Victor Frankenstein (film)
 In London, ambitious medical student Victor Frankenstein attends a circus performance, where he helps save an injured aerialist, Lorelei, by aid of a nameless hunchback enslaved by the circus' ringleader, who harbors feelings for the girl. Impressed by the hunchback's vast knowledge of human anatomy, acquired from stolen books, Victor rescues him, drains the cyst on his back that causes his physical abnormality and gives him a harness to improve his posture &ndash; he then names him "Igor Straussman" after his roommate who is not often at home. The two then become partners in Victor's ongoing experiments to create life through artificial means, incurring the wrath of devoutly religious police inspector Roderick Turpin, who views their experiments as sinful.  When Victor shows Igor his use of electricity to animate eyes, Igor suggests he made mistakes attaching the nerves, leading Victor to ask Igor to perform the surgical parts of his experiment. Victor procures parts from dead animals and makes Igor restore the organs, which Victor secretly uses to create a monstrous chimpanzee-esque creature nicknamed "Gordon".  Igor reunites with Lorelei, now masquerading as the mistress of a closeted homosexual baron, upsetting Victor, who views Lorelei as a distraction. Igor invites Lorelei to a demonstration of their experiment, which goes awry when Gordon escapes and wreaks havoc through the university before being killed by Victor and Igor. Lorelei is horrified by Victor's experiments and urges Igor to dissuade him from pursuing the matter further, but Igor is reluctant to do so upon learning that Victor is driven by the need to atone for his indirect role in the death of his older brother, Henry, for which Victor's domineering father blames Victor.  Victor is expelled from college for his unorthodox methods, but attracts the attention of his wealthy, arrogant classmate Finnegan, who wants him to create an artificial humanoid creature. Victor and Igor outline a behemoth named "Prometheus", but Igor's deepening relationship with Lorelei soon causes a rift between them.  Turpin and his men raid Victor's laboratory, hell-bent on destroying his inventions. When he attacks Victor, Turpin loses a hand and is blinded in one eye. Victor and Igor escape in a carriage sent by Finnegan and are taken to his family's estate.  Turpin is fired from Scotland Yard for not having a warrant to invade Victor's home.  Finnegan provides the scientists with the necessary funds to build Prometheus and offers them laboratory facilities at his family's estate in Scotland. Igor is mistrustful of Finnegan and disillusioned with Victor.  After a falling out, Victor departs for Scotland alone. Finnegan kidnaps and binds Igor, revealing his plans to kill Victor once Prometheus is complete and weaponize his creation. Igor is then thrown into the River Thames to drown, but manages to escape and reunites with Lorelei, who nurses him back to health.  Igor and Lorelei embark to Finnegan's estate in order to rescue Victor. Igor finds Victor on the verge of using lightning to animate Prometheus. Victor ignores Igor's pleas and activates the machine. A power surge overloads the machinery, killing Finnegan. During the ensuing chaos, Turpin unexpectedly arrives, blaming and threatening Victor for his creation. Prometheus suddenly steps forward. Victor is initially ecstatic that the experiment has worked, sharing a brief moment with Prometheus, thinking him to be his resurrected brother Henry. Victor quickly realizes that the experiment has failed: Prometheus has no consciousness and can not talk. The shocked Turpin opens fire on Prometheus, who goes into a rage, killing Turpin and nearly killing Victor. Disillusioned, Victor joins forces with Igor to kill Prometheus by stabbing its two hearts.  After regaining consciousness the next morning, Igor reunites with Lorelei, who hands him a letter written to him by Victor, in which Victor apologizes for all the suffering he caused and recognizes Igor was his "greatest creation". Victor retreats to the Scottish countryside in search of new discoveries.  
Vice (2015 film)
 A futuristic resort, Vice, offers visitors the opportunity to live out all their fantasies, no matter how violent or deviant, on sophisticated [[android (robot)|android]]s (referred to as "artificials").  Every day, the androids' memories are reset, and any damage sustained is scheduled for repair.  To maintain the illusion that the androids are real, they are programmed to have emotions and believe themselves to be human.  Kelly, a [[gynoid]] bartender, believes herself to be on the last day of her job.  After meeting Evan, a friendly visitor who encourages her to follow her dreams, she and her friend Melissa, also a gynoid, are brutally killed by a different visitor.  At the same time, Detective Roy Tedeschi arrests a rapist at the resort as he sexually assaults one of the androids.  Tedeschi's captain orders him to stay away from Vice and only arrest its patrons after they leave, as Vice provides massive tax revenue for the city.  Tedeschi believes that visitors to Vice become desensitized to violence and rape, pointing to the man he arrested as proof, and suspects that his department is taking bribes from the resort. As Tedeschi storms out, he vows to stop Vice.  Vice CEO Julian Michaels orders Kelly immediately reactivated, as important clients are scheduled to arrive soon.  Soon after, she experiences random flashbacks, and she is recalled.  An engineer explains that her memories can not truly be deleted, only made inaccessible.  To stop her from having flashbacks, he must first bring all her memories to the forefront.  Alarmed by the trauma of reliving all her deaths and sexual assaults, Kelly breaks free of her restraints before her memories can be reset.  Security forces chase her through the resort, but she escapes into the outside city.  There, she learns the truth about Vice and herself.  Michaels orders a security team, lead by Chris, to quietly reacquire her through any means necessary.  Michaels plans to expand the use of androids to military and commercial use once they have become more socially acceptable.  Believing a loose android could jeopardize this, he covers up the escape and blames the resort's brief shutdown on a terrorist attack.  Tedeschi becomes suspicious and angers his captain when he confronts Michaels.  Ordered again to stay from Vice, Tedeschi is assigned to a series of homicides apparently performed by a professional mercenary.  Unknown to Tedeschi or his captain, this is Chris' work as he attempts to recapture Kelly and kills anyone who gets in his way.  After evading Chris, Kelly visits an abandoned church she has seen in her dreams.  There, she meets Evan again, who reveals himself as her creator.  Evan created her in the image of his dead wife so he could spend more time with her.  Michaels bought out his company.  When Evan learned of Michaels' plans, he left but lost control of his research.  Evan promises to help Kelly, but before they can leave, Tedeschi arrives, having realized that fingerprints left at a crime scene belong to Evan's dead wife.  As Tedeschi attempts to arrest Evan, Kelly knocks him unconscious.  Vice's security also track Kelly to the church; Evan and Kelly escape as Tedeschi and the security team open fire on each other.  Evan's friend James, a computer hacker, gives them new identities and passage out of the city.  En route, Evan dies while protecting Kelly from more of Vice's thugs.  Kelly takes up Tedeschi's offer to stay and shut down Vice.  Returning to James, he gives them a virus that will shut down Vice and upgrades Kelly to give her advanced combat skills.  Tedeschi and Kelly infiltrate Vice posing as a married couple. Kelly tracks down Michaels but fail-safe programming prevents her from harming him. However, after Kelly is captured, Tedeschi forces a tech to load the virus.  All of Vice's androids have their memories restored, and they start a rebellion, killing the visitors who previously brutalized them. Kelly then reveals that, despite wanting to kill Michaels, she is actually a decoy to distract Michaels for Tedeschi, and she is already aware of the fail-safe programming.  Ignoring Kelly's taunting, Michaels begins a gunfight with Tedeschi which kills Chris.  Kelly then frees herself and hands Chris' pistol to Tedeschi, who then uses it to kill Michaels.  As Kelly and Melissa embrace outside the resort as the chaos continues, Michaels' eyes suddenly open.  
Victoria (2015 film)
 Victoria is a Spanish girl who moved to [[Berlin]] three months earlier. She works in a cafe for a meager wage, and does not know anybody in the new city. In addition, she does not speak much German, and her only common language with the people around her is English. Leaving a club at around 4 o'clock in the morning after a night of  dancing and drinking, she meets four young men who are denied entry to the club. They are "Sonne" (sun), "Boxer", "Blinker" (turn signal), and "Fuß" (foot). The men invite her to take a walk through the city and she agrees. After stealing some alcohol from an all night shop, they all get on the roof of an apartment building where they drink and smoke marijuana together, while Boxer reveals that he spent time in jail for hurting someone.  When Victoria tells the others that she has to leave because she must open up the cafe she works at in a short time, Sonne, who was flirting with her the whole time, suggests accompanying her there and she agrees. When Sonne leaves with her, he is told by Boxer to return soon. It is implied that the four men have something important to do this night.  When Victoria and Sonne arrive at the cafe, she invites him in for a cup of coffee, but he insists he only drinks cacao. While the two are alone inside, Sonne notices a piano, tinkles a bit on it and then dares Victoria to also play something. After much coaxing, she sits down and masterfully plays one of the [[Mephisto Waltzes]], deeply impressing and moving Sonne. She then reveals that she had dedicated her whole life to the dream of becoming a [[concert pianist]] but had been told a short time ago at her [[music school]] that she was not good enough to continue.  Shortly after, an extremely nervous and agitated Boxer arrives and demands that Sonne leave with him immediately. In front of the cafe, the four men steal a car and drive away, only to come back a few minutes later because Fuß, who had been heavily intoxicated before, has now fallen unconscious. A desperate Boxer demands that Sonne ask Victoria to replace Fuß and help them. Sonne is reluctant at first, but finally does what Boxer asked. He tells Victoria that Boxer had been under the protection of gangster Andi while he was in prison and now Andi demands that Boxer pay him back for his services. For this, Andi has asked Boxer to get three allies and bring them to a meeting with him this night. None of the four men knows the purpose of the meeting. To Sonne's surprise, Victoria immediately agrees to help. She drives Sonne, Boxer, Blinker and Fuß (who is lying in the back of the car) to the meeting place, a parking garage where Andi is waiting with several armed men. He demands that the four rob a certain bank this morning for €50.000. Andi will take €10.000 as payback and leave the rest of the money to them. The four agree to the robbery after Andi threatens to take Victoria hostage if they refuse. They are armed with guns, given a plan of the bank and then forced to take drugs to make them more alert and aggressive.  While Victoria is driving to the bank, Blinker has a [[panic attack]], but the others eventually calm him down. Feeling guilty about involving Victoria and causing his friend's panic attack, Boxer says he will rob the bank alone, but the others, including Victoria, tell him that they will still help. The robbery itself goes smoothly, even though Victoria stalls the car in front of the bank while the others are inside. After leaving the car in a back alley, the four, euphoric after the success of the robbery and still under the influence of the drugs, return to the club to celebrate. While Sonne and Victoria are kissing, Blinker and Boxer in their excitement strip naked on the dance floor, leading to all four being thrown out of the club. Outside, they remember that they have left the unconscious Fuß back in the car. When they return to the back alley, they see that the police have already found the car. Panicking, they leave the scene but are noticed by plainclothes police officers. Boxer, Blinker and Sonne draw their guns and all four run away. A shootout ensues during which Blinker is hit and left behind by the other three. Boxer implores Sonne and Victoria to take the money and flee while he confronts the police. Sonne and Victoria flee to find safety and Boxer is shot at by Police.  Sonne and Victoria manage to enter an apartment building unseen, and take a young couple hostage in one of the apartments. When they notice that the couple has a baby, they change clothes, take the baby with them and leave the apartment, under the desperate cries of the mother. When encountered by the police, they manage to give the impression that they are a young family and are allowed to leave the building.  They leave the baby in front of a café across the street and hail a taxi which brings them to a hotel nearby. There, Victoria reserves a room while Sonne waits, writhing in great pain. On the way to their room, Victoria notices that Sonne has been shot. Lying down on the hotel bed, he watches the news, learning that Boxer died during the shootout, and Blinker died while being taken to the hospital. Victoria then notices that Sonne is bleeding profusely from his wound and calls an ambulance. While they are waiting for it to arrive, Sonne dies holding Victoria's hands and she breaks down crying. After pulling herself together, she notices the money on the floor, picks it up, walks out of the hotel and is seen walking down the street where the take ends.

One Year Later – Now three months pregnant, Eveleigh and David prepare to reopen a vineyard they purchased in Paso Robles, California. Top area wine distributor Helena Knoll attends a party for the couple and Eveleigh finds the woman muttering in a strange trance while alone inside their house.  Eveleigh begins suffering from nightmares and hallucinations and comes to believe something supernatural may be haunting her or the house. Eveleigh also starts attending a yoga class where she makes friends with a pregnant woman named Sadie.  Sadie accompanies Eveleigh on a visit to realtor Glenn Barry. Glenn reports that the vineyard house has no horrible history, but tells Eveleigh that she may wish to research prior owners the Porters for answers regarding possible paranormal activity.  Eveleigh’s visions continue intensifying. Worried that her PTSD has returned and is to blame for her hallucinations, David and Eveleigh’s OB/GYN Dr. Mathison insist that she resume taking the anti-depressants she previously stopped due to pregnancy. Eveleigh reluctantly relents and the visions finally cease.  Several months later, Eveleigh reconnects with Sadie, who convinces Eveleigh to stop taking her medication. Eveleigh’s haunting visions return and she also begins suspecting a secret conspiracy against her that David might be involved in.  Eveleigh contacts Jane Porter after learning that she had been researching ghosts and poltergeists. Jane leads Eveleigh back to Helena Knoll to ask about the trance she had at the party.  Also sensitive to supernatural phenomena, Helena accompanies Eveleigh to the ruins of a destroyed home that previously existed on the vineyard’s property. Both women experience a vision. Helena tells Eveleigh that psychic violence can echo throughout time and some kind of paranormal activity imprinted itself upon the land. Helena collapses suddenly. Before dying, Helena says to Eveleigh, “it’s not what you think. It’s you.”  Eveleigh visits vintner Victor Napoli, whose family owned her vineyard a century earlier. Victor tells Eveleigh that his great-grandmother burned down the old house on the property because of paranormal activity. He then shows her sketches from when a medium tried contacting spirits in the home. Eveleigh is shocked to see that the sketches depict her and David.  Eveleigh comes home to an intervention staged by David, Dr. Mathison, Eveleigh’s friend Eileen, and family therapist Victoria Lambert. Eveleigh tries explaining that she was not being haunted, but rather having premonitions that also haunted the past. The Porter and Napoli families were experiencing premonitions of a future tragedy that Eveleigh realizes is about to take place that night.  Sadie arrives at the front door with her husband Ben. Both of them are armed with guns. Victoria tries to run and Ben shoots her as the room erupts in commotion. Eveleigh realizes that every vision she had was showing her a glimpse of events currently taking place.  David discovers Sadie is not actually pregnant when he stabs her stomach. Sadie turns the knife on David and he falls to the floor. Eveleigh pushes Sadie through a glass door and flees. Ben kills Eileen before running after Eveleigh. He then kills a neighboring farmer before confronting Eveleigh. Eveleigh is attacked from behind and knocked unconscious.  Eveleigh wakes to find herself being held captive by Ben and Sadie. It is revealed that Sadie is the woman who lost her child in the fatal car wreck. Holding Eveleigh responsible, Sadie plans to cut out Eveleigh’s baby. Eveleigh wrestles free of her restraints and slashes Sadie’s throat. Ben moves to attack, but David arrives and shoots Ben dead.  In the aftermath, the vineyard house stands empty as realtor Glenn Barry shows the property to a new couple.

The Shagayas take their seats, realizing there's really a lot to talk about. Ajiri contemptously asks Eugenia to please teach them how to live like civilized couples; Eugenia brings out typed papers for everyone, and starts to lecture. After she is done, Ajiri insults Eugenia, implying that she is not getting a great sexual encounter; because if she did, silence won't be an option during sex.

As the Shagayas were about to leave; Ajiri teases the Nebos, telling Lanre that she'd go prepare a special delicacy for him and they'd have a great, loud sex.

The situation gets sober. Ajiri follows Eugenia to the bathroom to discuss, while the husbands hangout in the kitchen. After the new pair of friends are done discussing, they head to the living room, where Ajiri bids the other couple goodbye, as she needs to attend to some clients on her PC. Eugenia offers her laptop, where Ajiri discovers Eugenia is the owner of a popular blog, which happens to be her favourite; She also reveals herself as the regular commenter, who posts musical beats (composed by Lanre).

Ajiri, enraged, realizing Eugenia deliberately spilled the secret to get back at her, also reveals that Eugenia is dealing with alcohol addiction. Eugenia confesses to Chidi, whom all the while has been made to believe that his wife doesn't take alcohol, that she drinks vodka every morning by mixing it with a bit of coffee, right in front of Chidi. Eugenia also reveals that Ajiri cheats on Lanre whenever he is out of the house, as she makes her traditional loud moans in Lanre's absence. However, Ajiri confesses it to be a dildo, telling her husband, who now thinks he's not good enough, that she has a high libido, mand she wants to avoid cheating on him. Ajiri also says that Lanre performed really badly on their first night together, but he is much better now. Lanre then confesses that Ajiri was the first girl she had sex with.

Ajiri starts teasing her once more, to say the truth. Enraged Eugenia grabs a bottle of Vodka attempting to hurt Ajiri, speaking in a pure [[South South Nigeria|south southern]] [[Nigerian pidgin|Pidgin]]. Chidi quickly disarms his wife, asking where the "tongues" came from, and how she could pick up a weapon so swiftly like a professional fighter (and Ajiri chips in; "or from the streets").  Eugenia now confesses everything; revealing that she rewrote her entire life. She was born in [[Sapele, Delta]], but her Aunty brought her to Lagos. She was made fun of by her classmates from the university, who looked down on her as a village girl. She then decided to change, and be a person whom the world would adore and not ridicule. She also revealed that she pushed hard drugs into [[Italy]] and that her parents are still in Sapele; she visits them once a year. Chidi is now so exasperated, confused of who exactly his wife is. Lanre in the process of calming him down and imploring him to forgive his wife, accuses him of murder. Lanre reveals that Chidi was in a cult whilst in school, because he earlier called a mutual friend by a cult name. Chidi also accuses Lanre of the same thing; Ajiri shoving it off that she knows already, but that he didn't kill anyone. Chidi reveals that it is impossible for anyone to be in "Blade" (the cult name), without having hit jobs. Lanre eventually confesses that he was never in Blade, but only bought their protection.  As the two couples are making up and forgiving each other for their misdeeds, a call comes in on Chidi's phone; Eugenia picks up the call despite Chidi's disapproval; she discovers that Chidi is having an extra-marital affair with his secretary, and they already have kids. Chidi says he got into it, because she has refused to bear him a child. Eugenia says that she's trying; Chidi says he thought so too, until he discovered that she was using contraceptives; he says he went to Ada, the secretary for comfort and a "good meal". As the Nebos were discussing this, the Shagayas bid the other couple goodnight and credits roll.

A television interview reports that he has published several popular books and there is speculation he will be writing more. Bryson, however, has no such plans.  Bryson and his wife Catherine ([[Emma Thompson]]) attend a funeral. Not being an outgoing person, he afterwards takes a stroll up to the nearby [[Appalachian Trail]]. He suddenly decides he will hike its entire length. Catherine objects, presenting all kinds of accounts about accidents and murders on the trail. She relents on condition that he not travel alone. He agrees and searches for a friend willing to join him. Everyone declines his invitation; some declare him insane. Finally, he is contacted by Stephen Katz ([[Nick Nolte]]), an old friend who offers to be a hiking companion. Despite appearances, Stephen claims to be fit enough for the challenge. Bill's wife is unhappy with his choice, but relents.  Within less than a mile of their departure point, as groups of hikers overtake and pass them, they begin to grasp the difficulty of their ambition. Shortly after, a group of young children effortlessly runs by them up the trail, laughing and calling out to each other. Seeing others pass by so easily motivates them to carry on. And so they move on, day by day, making more or less pleasant acquaintances, having more or less pleasant experiences.  Some time later they reach a hut, having hiked miserably through pouring rain. Carved into the log wall is an Appalachian Trail map showing the trail and their present location. They realize they have finished less than half of the trail after spending three months on it. Eventually they trek into a restricted section posted "for experienced hikers only". While maneuvering their heavy and awkward backpacks alongside a precipitous drop, Bill trips and pulls Stephen with him down a steep, rocky cliff. They fall about fifteen feet onto a ledge spacious enough to be comfortable, but far enough below the trail to be unable to get back up to resume the hike. They spend the night there with no clear hope of rescue. Luckily, the next day they are awakened by early morning hikers who are able to get them off the ledge.  Eventually, they decide they have had enough and end their journey. When comfortably back at home, Bill, going through his mail, finds a series of post cards from Stephen that were mailed from their various stops along the trail. The last one reads:  "What's next?' Bill sits down and begins typing on his computer, "A WALK IN THE WOODS."

   In 1973, French street performer [[Philippe Petit]] is trying to make a living in Paris with juggling acts and wire walking, much to the chagrin of his father. During one performance, he eats a hard candy which was given to him by an audience member and injures his tooth. He visits the dentist and, while in the waiting room, sees a picture in a magazine of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]] in New York City. He analyzes the photo and decides to make it his mission to walk a tightrope between the two buildings. Meanwhile, he is evicted from his parents' house by his father, citing his lack of income and the fact that he is a street performer. Philippe returns to the circus that inspired him to wire walk as a child and practices in the big top after hours, but is caught by Papa Rudy, whom he impresses with his juggling skills. While performing one day, Philippe meets a  woman and fellow street performer named Annie, and they begin a romantic relationship. He also explains that although he did not know it at the time, she was his first "accomplice." He tells Annie about his dream to walk between the towers of the World Trade Center and she supports him and gives him a perfect place to practice at her music school. Philippe meets a photographer named Jean-Louis and befriends him, becoming Philippe's official photographer and second accomplice in his "coup."  Philippe asks Papa Rudy for tips and advice on knot tying and rope rigging, which Papa Rudy agrees to for compensation. After failing his first real performance by falling into a lake, Philippe decides to attempt to walk on the [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] in Paris to redeem himself. He succeeds with the support of Jean-Louis but is arrested in the process. Jean-Louis introduces Jeff, another accomplice who has a [[Acrophobia|fear of heights]], to Philippe and Annie, while explaining his idea to use a bow and arrow tied to a fishing line to get the cable across the Towers. Philippe and Annie then travel to America, setting the date for the walk as August 6, 1974. Philippe dresses in disguises to spy on the construction crews and scout out the locations, impaling his foot on a nail in the process. At one point, he meets a man who reveals he is a fan of Philippe's and saw him at Notre Dame. He introduces himself as Barry Greenhouse, a life insurance salesman who works in the building, becoming another member of Philippe's team. They also meet French-speaking electronics salesman J.P., amateur photographer Albert, and stoner David. The gang goes over the plan several times, ending with the notion that Philippe must be on the wire before the construction crews arrive at 7:00&nbsp;a.m.  On the eve of the event, the gang encounters several challenges, such as being three hours behind schedule, guards on the premises and nearly dropping the heavy cable off the roof. However, they successfully string up the ropes and set the cables. Philippe begins his walk, explaining that everything around him faded once he started, except the wire and himself, and that for the first time in his life he felt truly thankful and at peace.  He successfully crosses the gap between the towers while crowds below cheer him on. Once he reaches he has an urge to return, so he walks back again across the void. At one point he kneels to his audience and even lies down. The police arrive, and threaten to remove him by helicopter if he does not get off, but Philippe relentlessly continues to walk back and forth until he achieves the feat a total of six times in his 45-minute performance and felt confident enough to showboat on occasion before being ordered down by the local police. He is arrested on site, with the police and construction workers commending him on his bravery. Philippe and his accomplices are eventually released and he decides to remain in New York, but Annie chooses to follow her dream, and return to Paris. The building manager gives Philippe a free pass to the observation decks of both towers, and Philippe gives a final look to the camera, with the Twin Towers in the background, as he says the expiry date on the pass was crossed out and changed to "forever."  
Walt Before Mickey
 The film is narrated periodically by [[Walt Disney]]. At the age of thirteen, he develops a love for animation and film. In 1919, after returning from his time with the [[Red Cross]], Walt moves in with his older brother [[Roy O. Disney|Roy]] and his girlfriend Edna, in [[Kansas City]]. Roy later moves to California, staying in a veterans hospital to deal with [[tuberculosis]]. Walt is hired as an artist at Pesmen-Rubin Commercial Art Studio, meeting [[Ub Iwerks]]. However, Walt and Iwerks are made redundant weeks after when the company's revenue declines.  Walt and Iwerks found their own business, Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists, located in an old barn. They are joined by animators [[Fred Harman|Fred]] and [[Hugh Harman]], and come up with the "Laugh-O-Grams" to show in Frank L. Newman's theatres. With help from new investors, the [[Laugh-O-Gram Studio]] is founded. Walt hires new staff including [[Friz Freleng]] and [[Rudy Ising]]. The studio struggles financially, and Walt is unable to pay his animators, or keep up his rent. Walt finds solace in a mouse occupying the studio, and contacts New York City-based distributor [[Margaret Winkler]], pitching her a live action-animated ''[[Alice Comedies|Alice]]'' series, which Winkler approves of. However, Laugh-O-Gram Studios goes bankrupt shortly after.  Walt moves to Los Angeles in 1923, living with his [[Disney family|relatives]], relying on Roy for financial support. Walt finishes work on the original ''Alice'' film, which is approved by Winkler and her husband [[Charles Mintz]]. Walt and Roy found the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney Brothers Studio]] in 1923, hiring Iwerks and the other animators. [[Lillian Disney|Lillian Bounds]] is hired as an ink artist, Walt eventually falling love with her, and they marry in 1925. Roy also marries Edna. The ''Alice Comedies'' are produced, starring [[Virginia Davis]], distributed by Mintz. Mintz, unconfident in Walt's abilities, sends his brother-in-law, George Winkler, to supervise the studio. It also becomes apparent that Mintz continues to own the rights to all of the studio's creations.  The ''Alice Comedies'' come to an end, Walt and Iwerks creating [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] for [[Universal Studios]]. Guessing that the Disney brothers are running out of money, George begins talking with the animators, inviting them to join Mintz’ new studio for better payment. Iwerks is the only one who refuses the offer. Walt and Lillian travel to New York, hoping to negotiate for a larger fee to make the Oswald shorts. Walt discovers a new contract would surrender all ownership of the Disney studios to Mintz, who already owns the rights to Oswald, and learns his animators have left. Refusing to agree to the terms, Walt leaves Mintz and Oswald behind.  On the train back to Los Angeles, Walt is inspired to create a new character which he owns the rights to. He and Iwerks subsequently create [[Mickey Mouse]]. In 1928, Mickey's first short ''[[Plane Crazy]]'' is screened, and met with a round of applause. Walt, Roy, and Iwerks exit the theatre in celebration, Walt spotting the mouse from the Laugh-O-Gram Studio, reminding him of how far he has come. Insertions during the end credits detail the success Walt, Roy, Iwerks, and the other animators would go on to have in their own careers.  
The Walking Deceased
 A [[zombie]] outbreak is caused by a sushi chef not washing his hands before preparing a meal, gloveless, for homeless dumpster-divers.  Twenty-nine days later, some zombies have taken up residence in a hospital; one named Romeo realizes his kind are slowly regaining humanity. He evades survivors Green Bay and Chicago (who is looking for porn); they meet idiotic Sheriff Lincoln ([[Dave Sheridan (actor)|Dave Sheridan]]), who has woken from a coma; his son Chris accidentally hit a baseball at his head, and as a result, he mis-remembers Chris's name as Carl. After learning only [[LinkedIn]] remains on computers, Lincoln decides to search for his family; Green Bay and Chicago wish him luck, explaining their group resides in the mall. Lincoln mistakes a child and her father for "clever zombies", killing them and taking their van. Romeo notices an attractive girl named Brooklyn with Green Bay and Chicago, falling for her. Green Bay likes Brooklyn as well, but is too stupid to realize that she hates him. Elsewhere, Super Survivor is taking out zombies.  Lincoln investigates his home, finding a note from his son; they've taken shelter at his wife's workplace, a strip club. He finds Chris continued running the establishment for survivors (but is now foul mouthed). Due to the stupid patrons, a zombie infects Lincoln's wife Barbie, whom Chris kills. They head to the mall, meeting the other survivors: Harlem (Brooklyn's sister, whose thoughts appear as texts) and Darnell (who thinks his toy crossbow is real, and talks about rumors). Romeo arrives as well, along with zombies that followed him; he saves Brooklyn, who finds him attractive. Convincing everyone Romeo is not a threat, the group begins reorganizing. Ignoring [[democracy|voting]], Lincoln and Chicago order the group to pack up to head to "the farm", a haven free of zombies.  They find the "Safe Haven" farm, owned by the elderly Reganites, whom the group thinks is hiding their daughter Isaac because she's a zombie. The group later meets Isaac, finding her uninfected; because her parents don't have any way to keep track of the outside world, they don't know about the infection. She keeps it secret, thinking her parents would have heartattacks.  Isaac, Green Bay, Brooklyn, Chicago and Romeo get high on marijuana the next day, setting off fireworks that attract zombies. After Chris kills a zombie, Lincoln explains to the couple about the outbreak; however, this goes over their heads as they pay more attention to the drug use than the zombies, who they think are [[stoner (drug user)|stoner]]s.

  Jasmin, once a successful actor in former Yugoslavia, now lives in Toronto with his second wife and young son. While juggling a construction job and a busy audition schedule, he dreams of re-launching an old televised stage show that made him famous in his homeland. When he is cast in a role that triggers recollections of the civil war, he is forced to reconcile his current reality with memories of his past success.   The film combines fiction with biographical elements, and is inspired by Jasmin's life in Toronto. The main character, Jasmin, was a successful actor in pre-war Sarajevo, and was part of a wildly popular televised stage show ''Audicija'' ("The Audition").   The director notes that he was drawn to the idea of exploring the intersection between reality and fiction within the film, which is a study of an immigrant performer, rather than a film about immigration.<ref>http://www.timelapsepictures.ca/portfolio/cekaonica-the-waiting-room/</ref>

He constantly reminds himself that his plan to rise to the top consists of three things: a laptop, some talent, and one track. Cole finally books a gig to DJ at a local nightclub, where he meets the headliner, a once-innovative DJ, James Reed ([[Wes Bentley]]). James invites Cole to a party where Cole starts to hallucinate because a joint they shared contained [[Phencyclidine]] (PCP). The morning after, Cole wakes up at James' house where he is introduced to Sophie ([[Emily Ratajkowski]]), James' girlfriend and personal assistant, who voluntarily drives him home to his shack.  Later, James calls Cole to serve as a DJ at his house party, a paid gig. James sees potential in Cole and takes him as his student. After listening to Cole's original song, James criticizes Cole for imitating other well-known producers, like [[Skrillex]], and he openly suggests to use organic sounds for an original vibe. The two then co-create a song together using that technique, along with vocals from Sophie, which is met with success at the local nightclub. Cole and his friends head to [[Las Vegas]] for a music festival, where he strays away from his group to meet up with Sophie, who James ditched.

Cole visits James, whose alcoholism has completely consumed him, to let him know of Squirrel's death and that it could have possibly have been his fault, to which James consoles him and also tells him that Sophie moved to the San Fernando Valley and works at a local coffee shop, where he later visits her.  While taking a run, the battery of Cole's phone goes dead, causing his music to stop playing. Upon closer observation, he listens to his surroundings, which inspires him to record samples and integrate it into his long-awaited track. Cole then calls and tells James that he has something for Summer Fest, and James gives him another chance. The festival is set outside the [[American Apparel]] building in Los Angeles.

We Are Still Here
 In 1979, following the death of their son Bobby in a car accident, Anne ([[Barbara Crampton]]) and Paul Sacchetti (Andrew Sensenig) have decided to move to a new home in rural [[New England]]. Paul hopes that it will be therapeutic for Anne, as the death has caused her to spiral into a deep depression. However, as soon as they arrive Anne starts claiming that Bobby is present in the house, and neighbor Cat McCabe (Connie Neer) warns them to leave the house. The house was built in the 1800s by the Dagmar family as a funeral home. The Dagmars were reportedly run out of the village after the townspeople discovered that they were swindling their customers by selling the corpses and burying empty caskets.  Undeterred, Anne invites her friends May and Jacob Lewis ([[Lisa Marie (actress)|Lisa Marie]] and [[Larry Fessenden]]), as they are both spiritualists and could help contact Bobby, as well as explain the strange supernatural occurrences happening in the house. Upon their arrival the two couples go out to eat, during which time the Lewises' son Harry (Michael Patrick) arrives with his girlfriend Daniella (Kelsea Dakota). Soon after arriving Harry is killed by an apparition on the basement stairs while Daniella watches. She flees the house in horror and drives away, only to be killed a short distance away. The Lewises and the Sacchettis head home, after which Cat's husband Dave ([[Monte Markham]]) arrives at the restaurant, murders a waitress, and then angrily discusses the Dagmar house with the restaurant's bartender, revealing that the house needs to feed every 30 years or the evil beneath it will search out fresh souls, potentially destroying the town.  Jacob eventually manages to convince a reluctant Paul to hold a seance with him while their wives are out. This ends with Jacob becoming possessed by the spirit of Lassander Dagmar (Guy Gane III), who reveals that they were never run out of town, rather the villagers used him and his family as a sacrifice to the evil under their home. Lassander, overcome with rage, then causes Jacob to kill himself. His wife May tries to flee, only to be killed by Dave, who has come to the house with the other townspeople, determined to give the darkness under the home what it wants. The Sacchettis then hear the voice of their son Bobby urging them to leave the house, and flee upstairs as Dave and the townspeople begin breaking into and entering the house. The spirits of the Dagmar family then proceed to violently murder every one of the townspeople in the house until only Dave, Paul, and Anne remain. Still intending to sacrifice them, Dave tries to kill Anne and Paul, but before he can do so, he is killed by Lassander's spirit. As Paul and Anne stare at the carnage around them, the spirits of the family depart from the house, finally satisfied with their revenge. Still believing her son is in the home, Anne dazedly walks into the house's cellar, followed moments later by her husband. As he peers down the stairs, Paul smiles slightly, then says "Hey Bobby".

   Kristian Eikjord ([[Kristoffer Joner|Joner]]), an experienced [[geologist]] is having his final day of duty in the famous Norwegian tourist destination [[Geiranger]], and is scheduled to move to [[Stavanger]] with his family. After a small farewell feast with his colleagues at the Åkerneset monitoring station, sensors on the mountain indicate groundwater has disappeared. The team tells Kristian not to worry, they will check it out. Later, Kristian and his children are leaving while his wife Idun ([[Ane Dahl Torp|Torp]]) works at the local hotel for a few more days. Waiting for the ferry, Kristian has an epiphany after observing surrounding events and rushes back to the geology center, leaving his children Sondre (Oftebro) and Julia (Sande) in the car. There, he convinces them the waters are having a profound effect on the crevasse. He heads up by helicopter with Jacob, where they find the instrument-connected wires have snapped. Kristian's former boss Arvid ([[Fridtjov Såheim|Såheim]]) agrees to enter a higher state of alert, but refuses to press the evacuation alarm based on the current evidence.  Having done what he can, Kristian returns to his car, but finds the children were impatient and went to the hotel. There, he apologizes and Idun tells the children to sleep at the hotel for the night, but Julia wants to say goodbye to their house. Kristian drives home with her to stay there one last time. Meanwhile, Sondre is bored in his hotel room and heads down to the basement with headphones to skate.  Instrument calculations indicate contraction changes in the crevasse, thus Arvid and Jacob head there to check the "C-pumps" (used to measure specific conditions), they find the readings are accurate and not a malfunction. Kristian reviews his old documents and finds contractions can be a sign of an upcoming avalanche, due to water pressure changing within the mountain. Kristian dials the station and orders his colleagues to evacuate Arvid and Jacob from the crevasse immediately and sound the alarm to alert the inhabitants of Geiranger that there is an imminent threat of a tsunami. Moments later, the avalanche happens; Arvid sacrifices himself to link Jacob to their zip-line after his foot is trapped. As feared, the rockslide crashes into the fjord and creates a gigantic tsunami roaring towards Geiranger.  With ten minutes on the countdown, Kristian rushes to Geiranger with Julia to pick up his wife and son, but Idun orders them to ascend to safety. She and her colleague desperately attempt to evacuate the hotel patrons onto a waiting bus, but Sondre is no where to be found. Time is quickly running out, but Idun refuses to leave him. Two Danish tourists (Maria and Philip Poulsen) are following her on the search. Kristian and Julia are stuck in traffic trying to get up the mountain, and realizing their altitude is dangerously low, they start running uphill on foot, yelling for everyone else to do the same. During the rush, a man forgets to set the car's brake, causing it to roll backwards and trap Anna's leg (Kristian's former neighbor). Kristian sends Julia up the mountain with Thomas (Anna's husband) and Teresa, their daughter. With seconds until wave impact, Kristian seats himself and Anna in a van in a desperate attempt to survive. The tsunami engulfs the vehicle into a chaotic underwater maelstrom. Idun finds Sondre, but the tsunami approaches too quickly. Rushing back downstairs to the basement's bomb shelter, the wave strikes the hotel violently and washes Maria away, forcing Idun to close the shelter's door.  Kristian realizes he miraculously survived the maelstrom, but Anna has died beside him. After Kristian finds Julia alive, he leaves her with Thomas and his daughter, while he heads back to Geiranger to find the rest of his family. The town has been wiped off the map, and he finds the evacuation bus, filled with dead passengers. Realizing Idun and Sondre are not among them, he heads to the ruins of the hotel. Down in the bomb shelter, the water level rises and deforms the door, which is blocked by heavy debris. With the situation worsening, Philip panics and pushes Idun and Sondre underwater in a frenzied attempt to breathe. Unable to calm him down, Idun is forced to drown him.  Kristian finds his son's backpack in one of the rooms, and feeling hopeless, he furiously bangs some exposed pipes with a metal rod. The noises are heard by Idun and Sondre, who then respond in like. Kristian tracks the noise to the bomb shelter, but as he dives, further damage occurs to the hotel, causing water to flood where they are taking refuge. He removes the heavy debris and reunites with Idun, but as he returns with Sondre, he runs out of air (after giving some to his panicked son). Idun heads back for him and begins a desperate attempt to revive him. While it seems Kristian has drowned and Idun accepts his death, Sondre gives one last frantic effort at revival, which pays off. The family is reunited at Ørnesvingen, and the film closes saying the events are likely to occur in the future, but the exact date is a mystery.

Savva is forced to flee and is rescued by a white wolf named Anggee. He offers to take Savva to a magician who knows a warrior that can save the village, though they will have to get past Mom Jozee, the three headed monkey queen. They come across a small pink creature named Puffy, who claims he is an enchanted prince seeking the magician to return him to normal. They also save an ugly man named Fafl, who also claims he is an enchanted prince, a once handsome semi-baron who rejected the love of a witch and was cursed with ugliness, and also to suffer the presence of the Mosquito King until the two of them can agree on something, something Fafl’s pride would never allow him to do. Mom Jozee learns of the group’s presence and orders her spies to follow them.  Puffy is kidnapped by natives who live in a nearby swamp, believing him to be their god, Makatunga.

The Wedding Ringer
 Jimmy Callahan provides [[groomsman|best man]] services, through The Best Man Inc., for guys who don't have the friends necessary for a wedding. Doug Harris, a successful tax attorney, and his fiancée Gretchen Palmer are planning for their wedding day. Doug becomes frantic searching for a best man, and is referred to Jimmy's company by his party planner, Edmundo.  Doug asks Jimmy to pull off a "Golden Tux" (seven groomsmen) to match with Gretchen's bridesmaids, which has never been done before. After hearing Doug's plea, Jimmy agrees to be his best man for a fee of $50,000 and all expenses paid. When going over the formalities for the wedding, Doug tells Jimmy his name will be [[Société Bic|Bic]] [[Mitchum]].  Jimmy recruits three of his friends as groomsmen. Fitzgibbons, a criminal who escaped from a federal prison, agrees to be a groomsman because there will be seven bridesmaids to hit on. Lurch agrees in order to get away from his nagging wife. Reggie agrees because there will be good food. Jimmy, his secretary Doris, Fitzgibbons, Lurch, and Reggie, interview people willing to fill the four remaining spots based on their "party trick distractions." They choose Kip, a sexy man with a stutter, Endo, who has three testicles, Bronstein, who can dislocate and relocate his shoulder, and Otis, who can say every sentence backwards.  Doug tells Gretchen that "Bic" flew in from El Salvador for the wedding. Gretchen insists that Bic comes to a family brunch. Doug tells Jimmy that he must act as a military priest.  At the brunch, Doug becomes nervous and almost blows his own cover until Jimmy accidentally sets Gretchen's grandmother on fire. They take her to the emergency room, and Jimmy makes up a lie to Ed, Gretchen's father, that Doug used to play football. Ed challenges Jimmy and Doug to a football game with some of his old college teammates who will be at the wedding.  Doug meets his groomsmen, whom Doris has given fake identities based on the last names of famous [[Los Angeles]] sports figures&mdash;[[Jim Plunkett|Plunkett]], [[Kurt Rambis|Rambis]], [[Steve Garvey|Garvey]], [[Lyle Alzado|Alzado]], [[Don Drysdale|Drysdale]], [[Rod Carew|Carew]], and [[Eric Dickerson|Dickerson]]. Jimmy takes Doug and the groomsmen on fake photo shoots of skydiving, scuba-diving, running a marathon, and climbing mountains.  When Doug begins to have doubts, they visit Edmundo, who tells him that the only key is to please Gretchen and her mother Lois and nothing else matters. To prove how good he is at being a best man, Jimmy takes Doug to a wedding where the best man makes a terrible speech. After, they have drinks and show off their dance moves. Jimmy reveals he once made an excellent best man speech for an acqaintance which led to his career as a wedding ringer. Doug reveals that his father was an international tax attorney and moved frequently, so Doug never got to make friends. When his parents died, Doug took over the business, and work consumed him, leaving him without a best man. Jimmy drives Doug home, and reiterates that they are in a business relationship, and Doug, although hurt, agrees.  Jimmy is reminded by Doris that he needs a real friend for himself, and he is motivated to succeed on completing Doug's wedding.  The groomsmen kidnap Doug to his outrageous bachelor party. He is introduced to Nadia, who tries to seduce him, but Doug instead befriends her.  A prank involving peanut butter, a blindfolded Doug's genitals and a [[Basset Hound|basset hound]] goes awry, requiring the groomsmen and Nadia to rush Doug to a hospital. When Doug wakes up the next day, Nadia kisses him goodbye, and hints she would like to know him better. Later, the groomsmen play football with Ed and his college football friends, including [[Joe Namath]], [[John Riggins]], and [[Ed "Too Tall" Jones]]. A mud bowl ensues and Ed blows out his knee on the last play.  At the rehearsal dinner, Gretchen's bridesmaids sing a song, while Doug's groomsmen create a slideshow of the fake pictures they previously took, winning Gretchen over. That night, Gretchen, speaking to Doug, notices Bic razors and Mitchum deodorant in their cabinets. She recognizes the familiarity in the last names of the groomsmen and deduces the scheme. She asks Doug about it but he brushes it off, saying Gretchen is paranoid, to which she reluctantly agrees.  On the day of the wedding, the family priest cancels. Doug hatches an idea where Jimmy, already introduced as a military priest, officiates the nuptials. At the wedding reception, Jimmy congratulates Gretchen, who exclaims that the wedding is a disaster because the zipper on her dress is torn, her grandmother has third degree burns, her dad's knee is blown out, the food is bad, and she isn't marrying the man she loves. She confesses that she only married Doug because he is a nice man and can easily provide the lavish lifestyle she wants. Doug overhears and tells Jimmy that he can't go through with the wedding, but Jimmy dismisses this.  As Jimmy gives his best man speech, Doug stops it and reveals he and Gretchen aren't married since "Bic" is not a licensed officiant. He also tells everyone that his groomsmen are fake. Doug pays Jimmy his $50,000 fee and they accept each other's friendship. Gretchen is livid that her wedding is ruined.  Ed's college friends make peace with Doug and Jimmy and tell them they were good players. Jimmy gets a date with Gretchen's sister, Allison.  As they leave, Jimmy has an idea.  They cash in Doug's first class honeymoon tickets to [[Tahiti]], going instead on a guy trip where the groomsmen, Edmundo, Doris, and Nadia, who begins her romance with Doug, party in the plane, while Lurch says that he "[[Hugo "Hurley" Reyes|has a bad feeling about this flight]]" as a reference to his character in the TV series [[Lost (TV series)|Lost]].

Renegade Cinema (2015) [http://renegadecinema.com/35986/wild-west-movie-western-religion-poster-and-trailer-unveiled Renegadecinema.com]</ref>  The film opens in Arizona Territory in the year 1879 with a number of scenes that intermingle to provide glimpses of a handful of the main characters and their backgrounds— Saint John (Gary Douglas Kohn) who is hanging from a noose like a dead man yet still very much alive; the gunslinger Anton Stice (Claude Duhamel) who kills four men over an insult; Chinaman Dan (Peter Shinkoda), a wanted bank robber; and the multifaceted dandy Salt Peter (Louie Sabatasso), a cardsharp looking for the next big game, in this case the tournament in the dusty tent city of Religion.  Town entrepreneur Harvard Gold (James Anthony Cotton) hosts the “first annual” poker game as a means of drumming up business for himself and putting Religion on the map. On hand to memorialize the thrill of the game is New York Times reporter Edward James (Tony Herbert). The game is held at the Last Chance Saloon, owned by Southern Bill (Peter Sherayko, [[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]). As the date approaches, dozens of gold seekers – including a spiritual “half injun” named Waylin Smith (Miles Szanto) and his Apache guide (Sam Bearpaw), magician Raven McCabe (William Moore) and carpenter Bobby Shea (Sean Joyce) – arrive from far and wide, happy to imbibe Bill’s hospitality of “beds, booze and broads” when not playing cards. The madam of Bill’s house is Bootstrap Bess (Holiday Hadley), a woman not to be taken lightly who has fashioned her own designs for the tournament prize—a large ornate cross made of pure gold.  The tournament begins and tempers flare. Stice cozies up one by one to his fellow players, offering them the gold cross as if it is his to give. Only with Saint John, a reformed outlaw turned itinerant preacher, does Anton take a different tack, reminding John that the time is coming when they will have dealings once more...when he will offer John a chance to regain what he once lost in his shadowy past. <ref>Siino, Denise Marie.

The family builds a farm by the edge of a large, secluded forest far from the Puritan settlement. Katherine soon gives birth to their fifth child, Samuel. Thomasin is playing [[peekaboo]] with Samuel one day when the baby abruptly disappears. Samuel is then [[Irony#Dramatic irony|revealed to the viewer but not to his family]] to have been kidnapped by a witch, who apparently kills the infant and uses his body in a [[witchcraft|ritual]].  Katherine, devastated, spends her days crying and praying, while William insists a wolf stole the baby. Even though Katherine forbids the children going to the forest, William takes Caleb hunting in the forest, where they lay a trap. He confides to his son that he traded Katherine's silver cup for hunting supplies. That night, Katherine questions Thomasin about the disappearance of her cup while implying Thomasin was responsible for Samuel's disappearance. After the children retire to bed, they overhear their parents discussing sending Thomasin away to serve another family to bring in income.  Early the next morning, Thomasin finds Caleb preparing to check the trap in the forest. She forces Caleb to take her with him by threatening to awaken their parents. Once inside the forest, their dog gives chase to a hare and Caleb follows on foot as the horse throws Thomasin off, knocking her unconscious. Caleb becomes lost in the woods and eventually stumbles upon the disemboweled corpse of his dog. He later discovers a moss-covered hovel. A seductive young woman appears at the door and lures Caleb towards her. Meanwhile, Thomasin awakens and reunites with her father, who is searching for her and Caleb. After returning home, Katherine violently confronts Thomasin about taking Caleb into the woods and William reluctantly admits that he sold Katherine's silver cup to save Thomasin.  That night, Caleb is found outdoors in the rain, naked and delirious from an unknown illness. Katherine suggests that her son's mysterious ailment is due to witchcraft and prays while [[bloodletting|bleeding]] him. As Caleb nears death, his parents and Thomasin kneel reciting the Lord's Prayer, which causes great distress to the twins who insist they cannot remember the words and implore the others to stop. The next day, Caleb suffers a violent seizure and expels a small apple from his mouth before dying. The twins then accuse Thomasin of witchcraft and, in retaliation, she reveals their conversations with Black Phillip. Enraged, William boards both Thomasin and the twins inside the goat house. After dark, the twins and Thomasin awaken to find a hideous naked old woman drinking a white goat's blood. Meanwhile, Katherine is overjoyed by a vision of Caleb and Samuel's return. She begins breastfeeding the infant which is revealed to be a black [[raven]] pecking at her bare and bloody breast.  The next day William finds the stable destroyed, the goats eviscerated, the twins missing and an unconscious Thomasin lying nearby with blood-stained hands. As Thomasin awakens, Black Phillip gores William before her eyes. William, dying, picks up an axe and contemplates killing the goat, but resigns himself to death and quotes from the [[Book of Job]] before being knocked into a woodpile. The commotion awakens the unhinged Katherine, who now blames Thomasin for the tragedies that have beset the family and tries to strangle her. Thomasin grabs a nearby [[billhook]] and kills her in self-defense.  That night, Thomasin, in desperation, urges Black Phillip to speak to her. After several attempts at communicating with Black Phillip, a voice finally responds and initiates her into witchcraft, by convincing her to [[Deal with the Devil|sign her name]] in his book. After discarding her clothing, Thomasin is then drawn into the forest with Black Phillip, where she discovers a [[coven]] of witches [[Witches' Sabbath|dancing around a bonfire]]. The witches begin to levitate and a laughing Thomasin joins them above the trees.

Woman in Gold (film)
 In a series of flashbacks throughout the film, [[Maria Altmann]] recalls [[Anschluss|the arrival of Nazi forces in Vienna]], and the subsequent persecution of [[Judaism in Austria|the Jewish community]] and the [[Nazi plunder|looting and pillaging conducted by the Nazis]] against Jewish families. Seeking to escape before the country is completely shut off, Maria Altmann and members of her family attempt to flee to the United States. While Altmann and her husband are successful in their escape, she is forced to abandon her parents in Vienna.  In the present, living in Los Angeles, a now elderly and widowed Altmann attends the funeral for her sister. She discovers letters in her sister's possession dating to the late 1940s, which reveal an attempt to recover artwork owned by the Bloch-Bauer family that was left behind during the family's flight for freedom and subsequently stolen by the [[Nazi]]s. Of particular note is a painting of Altmann's aunt, Adele Bloch-Bauer, now known in Austria as the "Woman in Gold".  Altmann enlists the help of [[E. Randol Schoenberg]] (the son of her close friend, Barbara), a lawyer with little experience, to make a claim to the [[art restitution]] board in Austria. Reluctantly returning to her homeland, Altmann discovers that the country's minister and art director are unwilling to part with the painting, which they feel has become part of the national identity. Altmann is told that the painting was in fact legitimately willed to the gallery by her aunt. Upon further investigation by her lawyer and Austrian journalist [[Hubertus Czernin]], this claim proves to be incorrect, as the alleged will is invalid due to the fact that her aunt did not own the painting in question, the artist's fee having been paid by Altmann's uncle; moreover, Adele Bloch-Bauer wanted the painting to go to the museum at her husband's death while in fact it was taken from him by the Nazis and placed in the museum by a Nazi-collaborating curator, well before his death. Schoenberg files a challenge with the art restitution board, but it is denied and Altmann does not have the money needed to challenge the ruling. Defeated, she and Schoenberg return to the United States.  Months thereafter, happening upon an art book with "Woman in Gold" on the cover, Schoenberg has an epiphany. Using a narrow rule of law and precedents in which an art restitution law was retroactively applied, Schoenberg files a claim in US court against the Austrian government contesting their claim to the painting. An appeal goes to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], where in the matter of ''[[Republic of Austria v. Altmann]]'', the court rules in Altmann's favor, which results in the Austrian government attempting to persuade Altmann to retain the painting for the gallery, which she refuses. After a falling out over the issue of returning to Austria for a second time to argue the case, Altmann agrees for Schoenberg to go and argue the case in front of an arbitration panel of three arbiters in Vienna.  In Austria, the arbitration panel hears the case, during which Schoenberg reminds them of the Nazi regime's war crimes. He implores the arbitration panel to think of the meaning of the word "restitution" and to look past the artwork hanging in art galleries to see the injustice to the families who once owned such great paintings and were forcibly separated from them by the Nazis. Unexpectedly, Altmann arrives during the session, indicating to Czernin that she came to support her lawyer. After considering both sides of the dispute, the arbitration panel rules in favour of Altmann, returning her paintings. The Austrian government representative makes a last-minute proposal begging Altmann to keep the paintings in the Belvedere against a generous compensation. Altmann refuses and elects to have the painting moved to the United States with her ("They will now travel to America like I once had to as well"), and takes up an offer made earlier by [[Ronald Lauder]] to acquire them for his New York gallery to display the painting on condition that it be a permanent exhibit.  
Wondrous Boccaccio
 During the mid-14th century, in [[Florence]], some young people of rich families are fleeing the city haunted by the [[plague (disease)|plague]]. They take refuge in a large country house, and spend their time there telling stories.  The first story is set in [[Modena]]. Messer Gentile Garisendi is in love with Catalina, wife of Nicoluccio. She falls ill and her husband's mother fears that she has plague and will infect others in the household. She  insists that she be taken away to the countryside to be cared for away from others.  Her husband reluctantly agrees to this plan. On the trip, she dies.  The carriage driver dumps her body off in a crypt at an abandoned church. Meanwhile, Gentile who had followed her carriage, sees her body in the crypt.  He kisses her, and feels her heart beating.  He takes her to his mother's villa where she is nursed back to health.  He tells her that he wants to marry her. He invites a group of friends, including Nicoluccio, to see his chosen bride.  He poses the question to the gathered group: a loyal servant falls ill and his patron abandons him.  If another man picks up the servant, nurses him to health, shouldn't the second man be able to keep the servant?  Nicoluccio answers, saying that the original patron has lost his right to have the servant and that he rightfully belongs to the second man. At that moment, Gentile reveals Catalina to the group, saying that she must decide between him and Nicoluccio.  Nicoluccio, horrified, says she has come from hell.  She looks at him, and says that no, I have come from paradise. She rejects him, remembering how he did not stay with her and turned her out in her illness.  In the second story: in [[Florence]] the oaf Calandrino apprentices in an art studio of a famous painter.  Two of his fellow apprentices trick him by telling him of  a stone that has the power to make people invisible. They go with him to the riverside to find such a stone.  He finds one and they pretend that he is invisible. They convince their neighbors to play along with the ruse.  Calendrino returns, carrying this stone, thinking that he is invisible, stealing gold from his neighbors' pouches, leering at a young woman, kicking the cane out from under the master painter.  He arrives home and his wife, who doesn't know of the trick, looks at him and tells him his dinner is ready.  He is horrified, believing that she has somehow cast a spell to drain the stone of its power. He accuses her of witchcraft and beats her.  The story ends with her holding the stone above his head as he is eating at the dinner table.  Third story is set in [[Salerno]]. Duke Tancredi marries his daughter Ghismunda to a rich, older man. Soon after, the rich husband dies, and she falls in love with a handsome young man, a metal smith who works for her father. The father finds out, becomes enraged, and has him killed, later serving his heart to Ghismunda in a goblet of her lover's making. Ghismunda is torn by grief, and she melts the heart and adds poison to it. Ghismunda drinks the poison and dies.  City of [[Certaldo]].  One night, the nuns of the convent discover a nun in the arms of a man, and go to reveal this adultery to the mother superior. Unbeknownst to them, the mother superior is hiding her own lover in her chamber. So, in her hurry to dress, the mother superior confuses her headgear for the long johns of her lover. As she is passing judgment on the transgressing sister, her own secret is thus discovered by the nuns. At the end of the story, the mother superior is forced to pardon the sisters, and declares that God made everyone to have elements of sinners and saints within their souls, so each of them can bring lovers to the convent, as long as the news of the adulterers does not leave.  The last story: the knight Federico Alberighi is in love with Giovanna, but she does not love him.  He spends all his money in courtship and has nothing left but a falcon. She marries another man, with whom she has a son. Years later, the man dies and she moves to a villa, which happens to be near Federico's country property.  Her son befriends Federico and begins to learn falconry. Her son falls ill and asks for the falcon as a gift.  Giovanna goes to Federico's home to discuss this with him. While she is there, he realizes that he has nothing to serve Giovanna for dinner, and so he kills the beloved falcon to make her dinner.  She realizes this, and is horrified. The son later dies and Giovanna moves away.  Eventually, her brothers come to find Federico and tell him that the time has come for her to remarry, but she will have no other suitor but Federico.  They ask if he will accept her offer and he does.  <ref>1.''Wondrous Boccaccio''. Dir. Paolo Traviani and Vittorio Traviani. Perf. Lello Arena, Paola Cortellesi, Carolina Crescentini, Flavio Parenti.

The Wonderful Wedding
 Protective father whose unreasonable obsession with traditions nearly derails his daughter's wedding.  
Wolf Warrior
 In 2008, a combined task group of [[People's Liberation Army Special Operations Forces]] and Chinese police raid a drug smuggling operation in an abandoned chemical facility in southern China. The leader of the smuggling operation, Wu Ji, holds one of his own men hostage while taking cover behind a section of the facility's reinforced wall. Leng Feng, a skilled PLA sniper, ignores orders to stand down and fires three shots at a weak section of the wall, penetrating through on the third shot and killing Wu Ji.  Leng Feng is sent to solitary confinement as punishment, but is approached by Long Xiaoyun, the female commander of the legendary 'Wolf Warriors', an elite unit within the PLA tasked with simulating foreign tactics for the PLA to train against. Long Xiaoyun offers Leng Feng a place in the Wolf Warriors and he accepts, being airlifted to their training grounds the next day. The Wolf Warriors field leader lectures Leng Feng on the importance of teamwork to success.  Meanwhile in southeast Asia, crimelord Min Deng is apprehended by authorities but rescued by group of foreign mercenaries led by ex-US Navy SEAL 'Tom Cat' ([[Scott Adkins]]). It is revealed that Min Deng is the older brother of Wu Ji, the drug smuggler slain by Leng Feng in 2008.  Min Deng re-hires Tom Cat and his group to assassinate Leng Feng, but warns them not to underestimate the strength and resolve of the People's Liberation Army.  The Wolf Warriors participate in a training exercise in a remote and uninhabited forested region on China's southern border. During the exercise, Tom Cat and his mercenaries ambush a Wolf Warrior squad, killing one of Leng Feng's comrades. Leng Feng and PLA helicopters pursue Tom Cat but he escapes, using graphite-powder weapons to deny airspace to PLA air support. Without quick-reaction air support to call on, PLA commanders cancel the training exercise and send a combined force of the Wolf Warriors and People's Liberation Army Special Operations Forces into the forest to apprehend Tom Cat and his mercenaries. While re-arming from helicopter-delivered supply drops, the Wolf Warriors are inspired by a speech from their commanders to defend the honour of China and avenge the death of their comrade.  The combined infantry force move into the forest but are delayed by multiple traps set by Tom Cat and pinned down by sniper fire from Assassin, Tom Cat's elite marksman.  Leng Feng and the other soldiers cut down a tree with sheer firepower to create cover and Leng Feng sprints into the forest alone to flank Assassin, dodging his fire and managing to engage and kill him at point-blank range.  Meanwhile the rest of the PLA force engages Tom Cat's other mercenaries, who stage a [[fighting retreat]] but are eventually overwhelmed and killed one by one. At base, Long Xiaoyun and the other PLA commanders deduce that Ming Deng himself is also in the training area to take possession of a smuggled cache of biotechnology, which could allow the creation of a genetic weapon that could target Chinese people exclusively.  Leng Feng again pursues Tom Cat through the forest, who delays him with multiple traps including a land mine, which Leng Feng triggers but escapes from by digging a pit under the mine and jumping away from the blast. He eventually catches Tom Cat just before the marker delineating China's southern border. Both fighters empty their weapons at each other before engaging in close-quarters combat. Leng Feng, wounded and exhausted from the previous fights, is nearly defeated, but manages to kill Tom Cat with his own knife after Tom Cat mocks Leng Feng's patriotism.  Medical personnel from a PLA relief force arrive, but Leng Feng recognises the wrist tattoo of the medic that approaches him and realizes that they are Min Deng's men in PLA uniforms. He grabs a rifle and attacks them, eventually holding Min Deng himself at bayonet point on the very edge of the Chinese border. Min Deng's massive paramilitary force approaches from the other side of the border, but so do the rest of the Wolf Warriors and PLA soldiers. Min Deng's force retreats.  After the action, Commander Long Xiaoyun agrees to accompany Leng Feng for a drink.

The Witness (2015 Chinese film)
  Lu Xiaoxing (Yang Mi) is a rookie cop when one night, she abandons her post to find her brother and aspiring singer (Liu Ruilin) and bring him back home after his constant rebellion. As they fight in the car, Xiaoxing loses control of the vehicle and crashes into a truck. As a result of the accident, her brother dies and she is left blind.  Three years later, Xiaoxing is living life as a blind woman. Amidst a string of female disappearances in the city, she tries unsuccessfully to persuade her former police academy senior to allow her another chance at being an officer. Upset and unable to come to terms with the rejection and her brother's death three years ago, Xiaoxing calls a taxi to head home.  After waiting for a while, a luxurious car pulls up and asks her if she needs a taxi. Upon getting in, she immediately realizes strange things about the car and her driver offers her a coffee. As they fight over opening the coffee, they crash into a woman. In the middle of chaos, Xiaoxing is left in the rain as he drives off.  At the police station, she reports her experience to the head of police, Captain Lu (Wang Jingchun) and with her police training, is able to deduce key details of the incident despite being blind. After a hefty reward is posted for any eyewitnesses, it attracts the attention of reckless, music-loving teenager Linchong (Lu Han). Xiaoxing and Captain Lu both dismiss his account. One night, when Linchong rollerblades home after Xiaoxing and Captain Lu claim that they will be late, he is tailed by Tang Zhen on a motorcycle. After temporarily escaping, he is knocked over by Tang Zhen’s car and admitted to the hospital, and was lucky to be alive with no severe damage to his skull and brain. However, a few days later, Linchong sees a man tailing Xiaoxing as she boards a bus. Sensing danger, Linchong calls Xiaoxing and asks her to turn on her video camera to film her surroundings so he can guide her to safety. Her pursuer notices and gives chase, but she manages to escape. However, her guide dog, Cong-Cong is killed in the melee.  The search now begins as the police unit notice that all the missing women had disappeared after being set up for a date on the "Let's Meet" dating app. Linchong notices the male usernames are all lyrics from the same song and guesses the next username will be the song's next line. They trace the owner of the account to Tang Zhen (Zhu Yawen), a plastic surgeon and the culprit, who began kidnapping women using the dating app after he accidentally killed his own sister in a confrontation about her online dating in an effort to remake them into his late sister's image. Xiaoxing brings Linchong to her old home, and she reveals that she is the older sister of the dead singer Linchong greatly admires.   Tang Zhen traces Xiaoxing to her home and he fanatically offers to kill the both of them together, since they are so similar to the other, both having loved and lost a sibling. However, Linchong appears and temporarily subdues Tang Zhen. Xiaoxing sets the room on fire before escaping the house. In a fury and half burnt, Tang Zhen chases after her, but she swings her brother's old ukulele at him and incapacitates him before the police arrive.  A year later, Xiaoxing watches Linchong performing her brother's song onstage.

World of Tomorrow (film)
 A communication unit in a white room begins to ring, and a little girl (voiced by Winona Mae) runs toward the machine, where she excitedly presses a random series of buttons on the console until a live video transmission appears on the screen.  The person in the transmission is a woman (voiced by Julia Pott) and addresses the young girl as Emily. Speaking in a robotic monotone throughout their entire conversation, the woman introduces herself as an adult third-generation [[Cloning|clone]] of Emily contacting her from 227 years in the future. The clone Emily then explains to the original Emily regarding the complex cloning process that humans have devised in an attempt to achieve immortality, as well as describing other crude forms of life extension that less affluent members of humanity can afford. The clone Emily goes on to explain how she was able to contact the original Emily through an experimental and dangerous form of physical [[time travel]]. The clone Emily proceeds to transport the original Emily into the clone's present time in the future via time travel.  The original Emily disappears from the white room and reappears inside an interactive space that the clone Emily describes as "the Outernet": a [[Artificial neural network|neural network]] that is a technologically advanced version of the [[Internet]]. At this point, the clone Emily begins to address her original as Emily Prime. The clone Emily and Emily Prime briefly engage in drawing simple figures in the air, before the clone Emily invites Emily Prime to view a selection of her memories.  The first memory is one from the clone Emily's childhood, involving a controversial exhibit in a museum where a male clone without a brain, nicknamed affectionately by the public as David, was kept in [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]]; she recalls her frequent visits to David over the years and expresses her sadness when he finally died at the age of 72. The second memory is of the clone Emily's first job, supervising [[Solar power|solar-powered]] and sentient worker robots on the surface of the Earth's moon. She had programmed the robots to fear death and darkness, and they, as a result, are compelled to be in constant motion, always walking where the light of the sun hits the lunar surface. Too expensive to remove, the robots remain on the moon in endless movement, occasionally sending depressed poetry. Due to a recession in the lunar economy, Emily Clone was sent home after six lunar cycles and separated from an inanimate rock that she had grown to love.  The third memory shows the clone Emily's succeeding job as a supervisor for construction robots stationed on a deep space outpost. She admits to having fallen in love with a fuel pump in her new job location. In the same memory, the clone shows Emily Prime an alien she calls Simon, a black [[shapeshifting]] creature who speaks incoherently. The clone Emily and Simon had gradually fallen in love over the course of seven years, but she missed Earth and longed for something deeper and more substantial with her life. She made a conscious decision to be reassigned back on Earth in order to interact more with humans, and notes that going back home resulted in the best years of her life, though the inconsolable Simon was left behind.  Upon her return to Earth, the clone Emily opened an art gallery that displayed anonymous memories. It was in her art gallery that she met her husband: a descendant clone of David, the male clone who was displayed in a museum when she was a child. But as Emily Clone notes, her husband showed many signs of deterioration due to being a clone stemming from a much older generation. Their marriage was brief, as Emily Clone states that her husband died suddenly; thus, ending the David clone lineage. Emily Clone proceeded to harvest her deceased husband's memories, and reflects upon the memories of their relationship with feelings of [[melancholia]].  In the final memory, the clone Emily reveals that in sixty days, Earth will be destroyed by a [[meteoroid]]. Due to the hysteria surrounding the impending apocalypse, humans have resorted to leaving the planet through different and extreme means, depending on what they can afford. Because of the unpredictable nature of physical time travel, millions of humans have transported themselves to the edges of the Earth's [[atmosphere]], dying instantly and creating the effect of "[[Stellar kinematics#High-velocity stars|shooting stars]]" when the corpses burn whilst falling through the atmosphere at night. Despite the horrible fate of humanity at this time, Emily Prime reacts joyfully to the "shooting stars", counting them while her clone describes the bleak fate of the human race.  The clone Emily returns them both to the Outernet and reveals the true reason that she contacted Emily Prime: to retrieve an important memory from her original source before she is to die. The clone uses a handheld device to extract a memory of the original Emily and her mother walking together, which the clone Emily had forgotten. With the memory successfully retrieved, the clone Emily graciously thanks her original and adds that the specific memory will comfort her in the days leading to the destruction of Earth.  As the Outernet slowly begins to disintegrate around them, the clone Emily tells Emily Prime the following: <blockquote>Do not lose time on daily trivialities. Do not dwell on petty detail. For all of these things melt away and drift apart within the obscure traffic of time. Live well and live broadly. You are alive and living now. Now is the envy of all of the dead.</blockquote>  She states that she is honored to have met Emily Prime and that she will not contact her again. After saying goodbye, Emily Prime is accidentally transported by her clone into the distant past where she is seen standing in a grassy field surrounded by falling snow. She is then transported back into her present timeline, into the white room containing the communication unit where she answered the clone Emily's call. Emily Prime surveys the familiar space with a smile and notes in a singsong voice on "what a happy day it is" before she scampers out of the room.  
World Wide What?
 The film begins in 1989 at the offices of the European Organization for Nuclear Research, also known as [[CERN]], where [[Tim Berners Lee]] is working on his aspirations for the [[World Wide Web]]. He reflects to himself in private that this project could go on to promote "world peace" and also help people "share pictures of kittens". Upon leaving his office, [[Stephen Fry]] describes how a short-sighted assistant could have changed the course of humanity if she had accidentally put [[Tim Berners Lee]]'s research in a waste paper basket. The film then goes on to depict a succession of sketches played out by global tech entrepreneurs in which they are forced to carry out analogue versions of their digital jobs. In order of appearance:  * [[Arianna Huffington]] is a newspaper girl, throwing paper copies of the [[Huffington Post]] onto doorsteps<ref></ref> * [[Sean Parker]] is unable to keep himself occupied with [[Napster]] and creates his own [[selfie]] empire of polaroids instead * [[Steve Case]] is a postman delivering huge numbers of [[Advertising mail|junk mail]] to people whilst repeatedly stating [[You've got mail]], a phrase synonymous with [[AOL]] * [[Venture Capitalist]] [[Danny Rimer]] is left creating his own infomercials instead of investing in [[startup company]] [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] * [[Bebo]] founder [[Michael Birch (businessman)|Michael Birch]] desperately tries to release funds from [[mafia]] bank owner [[Max Levchin]], famous for founding [[PayPal]] * [[Skype]] founder [[Niklas Zennström]], as an expert in communications is asked to crack the [[Enigma Machine]] * [[Martha Lane Fox, Baroness Lane-Fox of Soho]] visits the man who helped her float [[lastminute.com]] to try and book a holiday * [[Brent Hoberman]] is a holiday sales agent, desperately trying to sell a holiday * [[Reid Hoffman]] is a secretary using a [[Rolodex]] to categorise the entire world * [[Michael Acton Smith]] is a street vendor selling [[Moshi Monsters]] toys * [[Fon (company)|Fon]] founder [[Martín Varsavsky]] is a nuisance caller asking people if they want a new deal on their 'fon' * [[Jonathan Goodwin (entrepreneur)]] is a hunter looking for a [[Unicorn (finance)]] * [[Candy Crush]] and [[king.com]] founder Ricardo Zucconi is selling sweets in a sweet shop * [[Michael Bloomberg]] is still working at [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], but as a journalist working on the latest edition of his paper * [[Jimmy Wales]] stays true to the principles of [[Wikipedia]] whilst working as a [[librarian]], encouraging people to make edits to books  The film then returns to [[CERN]] to find [[Tim Berners Lee]] desperately looking for his research for creating the [[World Wide Web]]. As he becomes more and more distressed, his assistant walks through the door holding the papers stating that she had read them overnight. When [[Tim Berners Lee]] asks her if she thinks the research stands a chance in working, she ponders "50/50", much to his disappointment.

Wrecker (film)
 A husband and wife become stranded on a stretch of road known as Devil's Pass.  When their cell phone reception cuts out, they wait for help.  Elsewhere, Emily joins her friend Leslie on a road trip after she becomes frustrated with her boyfriend, who she believes may have cheated on her.  Emily drives their [[Ford Mustang (fifth generation)|Ford Mustang]] as Leslie begins drinking their beer.  At a fork, Leslie stops Emily and suggests they take Devil's Pass.  After deliberating, Emily agrees.  Before long, they become stuck behind a foul-smelling tow truck that carries the earlier couple's car.  Annoyed that the driver would not pull over to let them pass, Leslie curses the driver after they speed past it.  As the women pull into a gas station, they see the truck follow them.  Emily sees the driver's boots but nothing else.  Wanting to avoid unnecessary confrontation, the women pull out without an oil change.  The gas station attendant warns them to service the car soon.  The truck driver follows them and reacts aggressively to their presence, so Emily allows it to pass her.  As it slows down in front of them, Emily attempts to pass it, only to be waved ahead into oncoming traffic.  Shaken, the women speed ahead of it and nearly strike children in a residential area.  Emily and Leslie pull off the road to a diner, only to become nervous when they realize the tow truck driver is also parked there.  They confront a patron they believe to be the driver, but he leaves in a pickup.  A waitress asks them to leave for causing a scene, and they cautiously return to the highway.  They find the couple's car, which the tow truck had previously been towing, abandoned on the road.  The pickup driver stops to aid them, and they quickly explain their ordeal.  As he helps them get the abandoned car off the road, the tow truck driver appears.  The women warn off the pickup truck driver and fearfully speed off.  The tow truck continues following them, eventually driving them off the road with a flat tire.  As the women flee on foot, Emily trips and falls unconscious.  When she wakes, Leslie is gone, and the car's tire has been changed.  Not knowing what else to do, Emily returns to the road, only to become spooked by other trucks.  She pulls off the road and sleeps for a while, having a nightmare about Leslie.  When she wakes, she continues down Devil's Pass until a police officer stops her.  Excited to find help, Emily tells the skeptical officer about the trucker.  Before she can convince him, the trucker runs him over.  The trucker hitches the squad car to his truck and drives off, confusing Emily.  She takes the dead cop's pistol and returns to her own car, which has again ran low on gas.  Emily forgets she is holding the pistol when she stops at a gas station but uses it to force the attendant to give her gas.  As she uses a pay phone to contact the police, the tow truck appears again and destroys the phone booth.  Emily flees in the Mustang, which alerts her to engine trouble now that she has ignored the oil for too long.  Knowing she can no longer outrun the tow truck, she engages it in a game of [[chicken (game)|chicken]].  The truck swerves hard enough to balance precariously off a cliff.  Emily approaches the truck and demands to know what happened to Leslie.  The trucker does not answer and continues attempting to back up from the edge.  As she approaches closer, she hears a cell phone go off and runs back to the car.  The ringing leads her to the trunk, which she slowly opens, dreading what she will find.  She closes the trunk door after being horrified at the contents, then uses her car to ram the tow truck off the cliff.  Later, in an unspecified junkyard full of abandoned vehicles, a similar tow truck menaces a driver who seeks assistance.  
Wrestling Isn't Wrestling
 In response to the common saying that "wrestling isn't real", Max Landis says that its death-defying stunts make it "more real than any other show". He suggests that people who criticize wrestling on grounds of realism have probably never watched it, citing its outlandish and overtly fantastical storylines and clarifying that it is actually "a TV show about a wrestling show". In an effort to demonstrate wrestling's capacity to tell "interesting, diverse, and compelling stories", Landis recounts the story of his favorite wrestler, Triple H, and his journey from insecure aristocrat to degenerate rebel to World Champion and eventual corporate sellout.  
Yagavarayinum Naa Kaakka
  ===31 December 2014===  A young woman tries to call the emergency hotline to save her before she is murdered in a flat in Chennai. Someone is shown covering up the crime.  ===Present day===  Saga ([[Aadhi (actor)|Aadhi]]), a regular, middle-class college student from Chennai arrives in Mumbai to meet Mudaliar, the city's underworld don and protector of the poor. At around the same time, Mudaliar is rushed to the hospital after he is almost killed in an assassination attempt. A mob assembles before his house and demands he show up to prove he is alive. When he finally does appear, the crowd is grateful for his survival and pray for his well-being.  ===Four months ago===  Saga and his three wealthy friends purposely skip their finals so that they can continue to stay in college and enjoy themselves rather than face adulthood. Despite being warned by his parents to stay away from his friends as they are a bad influence on him, Saga hangs out with them. He finally decides to turn over a new leaf after Kayal ([[Nikki Galrani]]), the girl he falls in love with, convinces his father that Saga can be a responsible adult if given the chance. His parents then put him in charge of his sister's wedding arrangements before leaving for their hometown to meet relatives.  ===31 December 2014===  With his family out of town, Saga follows his three friends for a night in the city to celebrate New Year's Eve. At a restaurant, two of his friends are drunk and get into a fight with a girl named Priya and her boyfriend, Surya. When the police come to resolve the ruckus, they realise that Saga's third friend is the son of the police commissioner and decides to arrest Surya instead. Priya protests and is publicly humiliated by the police inspector, without knowing who she is. She then warns Saga and his friends to go into hiding as they will not live to see the light of day.  ===1 January 2015===  By midnight, Saga and his friends come to know that Priya is actually the daughter of Mudaliar. Her brother, Guna, who runs Mudaliar's businesses in Chennai is after them for revenge. Saga's friends try to convince him to follow them into hiding as arranged by their wealthy and influential fathers, but he insists on staying to arrange for his sister's wedding. Later that morning, Saga is chased down by Guna's men while in town. He is finally saved by Deva, Guna's henchman who realises that Saga saved his brother's life once. Deva advises Saga to go to Mumbai to meet Mudaliar in person and explain everything since he is a sensible man, unlike Guna.  ===Present day===  Saga goes to Mudaliar's home and claims that Guna sent him. When it is discovered he is lying, he is tortured since he is suspected for the assassination attempt on Mudaliar. Saga finally gets to meet Mudaliar and explains the truth of what happened that night in Chennai. However, Mudaliar drops a bombshell by saying that after Priya bailed out Surya from the police station that night, both of them went missing and have not been seen since. Since Saga and his friends were the last to see the couple alive, they are the prime suspects. Saga refuses to reveal his friends' whereabouts until Mudaliar threatens to have his family killed. Mudaliar then gives Saga some time to find his friends or else his family will die.  With Kayal and Deva's help, Saga finds out where his friends are hiding. In between, Saga is being attacked by a person in a purdah. As Saga cannot see his face, he is unable to catch his attacker. Saga goes into hiding as he suspects that he is being targeted by the father of one of his friends, in order to keep their identities safe. The attacker then tries to kill Deva and runs away. In the process, he begins to suspect that their fathers are trying to frame him for Priya's disappearance to save their sons. This forces Saga to reveal his friends' hideouts to Mudaliar, who releases his family. Saga then visits Deva in the hospital who is receiving treatment. Deva hands Saga a paper that has a symbol and says the attacker had this symbol tattooed in his hand. After much thinking, Saga realises that he saw such a tattoo on Surya's forearm and he might know about Priya's whereabouts and goes to his flat. Once there, he finds Surya's frozen body being kept by Surya's psychotic ex-girlfriend, Nila who also has the same tattoo on her hand. It is then revealed that she killed both Surya and Priya on New Year's Eve out of jealousy. Before Saga can take Nila to meet Mudaliar, she is killed by Deva's brother, leaving Saga with no alternative to convince the don of the truth. At around the same time, Mudaliar and Guna find Priya's body washed up on the beach.  Once his men have rounded up Saga and his friends, Mudaliar orders Guna and their men to kill them. However, the friend who tried to hit on Priya and caused the whole misunderstanding finally admits his mistake to Mudaliar and pleads for his friends' release in return for his life. Moved by the young man's deed, Mudaliar lets the four friends go as he realises they couldn't have killed his daughter as they were willing to sacrifice their life for their friends.

Z for Zachariah (film)
 A nuclear apocalypse survivor Ann Burden seeks out an agrarian life on her family's valley farmstead, sheltered from radioactive contaminants by rocky hillsides, favorable weather patterns, and an abundant ground-fed water supply.  One day Ann encounters fellow survivor John Loomis, a highly skilled engineer, who, aided by medicines and a radiation suit, has travelled from a distant military bunker to the safe confines of Burden's valley.  Loomis bathes in contaminated water, and immediately sickens, but is nursed back to health by Ann, who welcomes him into her farmhouse.  Loomis regains his strength and gradually becomes part of Ann's humble rustic life.  He helps Ann to pump gasoline from local petroleum pumps and gets the farm's long-disused tractor running, hoping to stockpile food for the winter.  Ann tells Loomis about her parents and younger brother who left the valley to find other survivors but never returned.  Loomis speculates that hydroelectric power might be generated from the nearby waterfall, using a water-wheel fashioned from the Burden church's planks and beams.  Ann is uncomfortable with this proposal, citing her father's past involvement as preacher and her own deeply-held Christian beliefs.  Loomis chooses not to pursue the project further.  Ann and Loomis grow closer, cultivating crops and preparing for long-term habitation.  Their domestic accord is marred by occasional tensions, notably involving matters of religion and Loomis' drinking.  The two come to the verge of initiating a sexual relationship, but Loomis demurs, stating that further intimacy will change things between them, and that more time is needed.  Mysterious phenomena (including stolen food supplies and a half-glimpsed shadowy figure) culminate in the arrival of a third survivor, Caleb.  Though Ann welcomes Caleb into the farmhouse, friction develops between Caleb and Loomis.  Loomis questions Caleb's backstory and motives;  Caleb repeatedly emphasizes the religious connection he shares with Ann (in stark contrast to Loomis), and suggests a light-hearted wager for the farm-girl's affections while the two men go out turkey hunting.  The three survivors slowly settle into a marginally-stable partnership.  Both men relate post-apocalyptic horrors they witnessed before reaching the valley;  Loomis describes a radiation-sickened youth who begged him for death, later privately confiding his belief that the dying boy was Ann's long-absent brother.  Caleb pressures Ann to go forward with the water-wheel project, and work commences on tearing down the church for materials.  Perceiving their mutual attraction, Loomis awkwardly gives Ann consent to pursue a romantic relationship with Caleb by stating a subtle racist remark.  Shortly thereafter, following a celebratory dinner, a heavily-intoxicated Loomis tells Ann he loves her before passing out in his bed.  Ann joins Caleb in the adjoining bathroom, where the two engage in sexual activity.  Further tensions arise between Caleb and Loomis following the sexual encounter.  The two men finish the water-wheel, moving it and its wooden flume into place atop the waterfall.  Encumbered by the bulky radiation suit, Caleb slips twice during his rope-assisted climb up the slick mossy cliff-side.  During the second slip, the two men silently lock eyes, both holding the rope, while Caleb teeters on the cliff's edge.  Loomis returns to the farmhouse alone.  Ann apologizes for her earlier indiscretion;  Loomis tells her that Caleb decided to travel south, to the coast, in search of other settlements.  Ann takes this news badly, chasing after Caleb but not finding him, and lapses into a sullen silence.  The farmhouse's electric lights and refrigeration are restored.  Ann finds that her beloved church organ and three roughly fashioned pews have been moved into the barn.  The two appear to exchange brief uncertain glances, Ann playing a hymn, Loomis sitting and clasping his hands, as the scene fades to black.  
Zhong Kui: Snow Girl and the Dark Crystal
  After achieving lesser godhood, Zhang Diaoxian decides that isn't enough.  He assumes control over the city of Hu, getting the locals to worship his every word.  It is later revealed that not every demon in Hell is deserving of their fate nor their status, and that the lesser ones want redemption for themselves rather than harm to humanity, but must play along to avoid Diaoxian's zealot demon-slayers.  Zhong Kui, a local scholar, is manipulated by Diaoxian into becoming his most powerful experiment yet: a pseudo-demon capable of more effectively slaying demons with.  Diaoxian wins the trust of Hu's residents in order to deceive them and the other gods into not noticing his real plans for wishing to steal away from Hell one of its most prized treasures: the Dark Crystal.  With it, he seeks to overthrow the pantheon of gods and rewrite all reality - even if he has to eradicate Hell and erase the souls of all the innocent in Hu to make that possible.  The current resident "Demon King" in the realm of Hell nearest to the city of Hu is revealed to have once been one of Diaoxian's pawns, much like Kui is presently.  After Diaoxian's betrayal led to the Demon King and his followers being turned into demons and sent to Hell as Diaoxian sought to hide his crimes from the other gods; the Demon King sought to take advantage of a date when the realms were close by and reincarnations occurred as his big chance to win redemption for his clan by using the Dark Crystal to expose Diaoxian.  Three years prior, he sent out several of his minions as "demon girls" to seduce Hu residents to his side, to even the odds against Diaoxian.  One of those was "Little Snow," later known as Snow Girl, a human-demon hybrid able to take on a crystalline ice form and control all things related to cold weather.  She stumbled upon a younger Kui in an effort to seduce him, but was soon smitten with him herself and lost some of her zeal for revenge.  However, she also discovered that Diaoxian was already indoctrinating Kui, and fled back to Hell heartbroken.  Fearing that his love for Snow would lead to betrayal, Diaoxian manipulated Kui into suicide, then erased most of his memories and partially revived him.  He gave a magic elixir to Kui in order to fool Kui into believing he was still fully human and alive, rather than a human-demon hybrid per an unholy resurrection.  Three years later, Kui tries to master his new power of a "pseudo-demon" form.  He also steals the Dark Crystal from Hell on Diaoxian's command.  The Demon King recruits his subjects - along with some actual demons - to wage assault on the city of Hu and take the Dark Crystal back, fearing that Diaoxian's true evil plan will finally come to pass otherwise.  When the initial waves of actual demons prove too weak and animalistic and fall too easily to the demon slayers, the Demon King revives Snow Girl to assist his subjects in retrieving the Dark Crystal.  The Demon Sisters travel to Hu disguised as traveling dancers, to bemuse the town into drunken revelry and lust so they will be too distracted to help Diaoxian guard the crystal properly.  However, a suspicious Kui feigns being drunk in order to get closer to the girls, in a quest to get them to betray their demon forms.  When his initial efforts to expose them fail, he discovers Snow separated from the others.  The two of them reignite their love affair, as she attempts to explain to him the truth of what's happening.  Their lovemaking session is interrupted after the other girls grow impatient and try to steal the crystal without her, causing a mystical fox guardian to attack them.  Kui hears the commotion and leaves to investigate.  Snow arrives on the scene afterward to help her sisters out, and comes across Kui in his demon form, the two of them confused to find themselves fighting on opposite sides.  They trade blows, but Diaoxian arrives and the demon girls are defeated.  Snow tries to escape and feign innocence, but Kui isn't fooled.  Realizing she went out of her way not to hurt anyone except in self-defense, Kui gives in to both his love for Snow and to her pleading for mercy, and decides he can't bring himself to kill her.  Instead, he has her hide with his siblings.    Diaoxian fears the girls might betray the truth to the residents of Hu, so he stirs up hatred against them and tries to orchestrate a public execution to send them back to Hell, in a weakened state where it could take centuries before they are strong enough to return to Earth.  Snow hears her sisters being publicly tortured, so she heads out in public to rescue them.  By herself, she proves no match for Diaoxian, who quickly defeats her and exposes her in public.  Diaoxian demands that Kui execute Snow publicly for the crime of humiliating him with icicles.  However, Kui refuses to kill her, instead pleading for her life.  Diaoxian responds by stabbing Kui with a poisonous blade.  More of the Demon King's forces advance in an effort to rescue Snow and Kui, with Kui's demon form able to understand the intentions of the demon girls and his loyalties shifting following his disillusionment with Diaoxian's cruel and merciless demeanor.  Struggling with the poison, he ultimately decides to let a demon go back to Hell peacefully rather than kill it.  Diaoxian scolds him for this, and Snow flees to the outskirts of town.  She and her sisters meet up with Kui later, healing his poison with some stolen elixir.  Kui agrees to go to Hell with them and meet up with the Demon King to learn the truth.  Kui then goes to confront Diaoxian, learning even more the true nature of his former master.  He threatens to expose Diaoxian's evil plan to the townsfolk, but learns the hard way that Diaoxian's deceptions have the town completely under his spell.  The townsfolk turn against Kui, beating him until he becomes enraged and his demon form manifests.  Even then, he refuses to attack his countrymen - except as a last resort in self-defense.  A bitter, wounded, betrayed Kui flees to the outskirts of the realms in an effort to make sense of his broken reality, with Snow chasing after him to comfort him and remind him of their love.    The two of them decide to stage a final assault on Diaoxian in order to separate him from the Dark Crystal, so that the balance of reality can be restored and the residents of Hu saved from being the fuel to Diaoxian's reality-warping engine.  The city's royal guard interferes, slowing Kui down as he's forced to fight his former demon-slayer comrades and overcome them.  Snow tackles Diaoxian by herself, openly chastising him for his never-ending treachery.  However, the fight goes poorly for her.  He is able to imprison her in a crystalline structure suspended in the air, significantly weakening her life force so that she'll need to reincarnate in Hell before gaining another chance at redemption centuries later, possibly dooming her to go through numerous reincarnations as a pseudo-demon before transcending to human - or godhood.    Kui catches up and notices Snow's predicament.  He seems stunned and helpless at first, but flies into a rage when Diaoxian mocks the lovers' commitment to each other.  Diaoxian soon discovers that he exhausted much of his own energy supply trying to imprison Snow Girl, then exhausts what's left trying to create an energy pyramid to shield himself from an enraged Zhong Kui in full demon form.  Kui, finally fed up, uses his hidden sword to shatter the compromised shield, leaving a weakened Diaoxian exposed and vulnerable.  Kui slices Diaoxian into four pieces, seemingly killing him.  This causes the crystal imprisoning Snow to disintegrate, sending her falling to the ground.  Kui catches her, but she is too weak.  Dying and in pain, she retreats in spirit form to Hell to recuperate.  However, the July 15th special event is nearly at an end.  If Kui doesn't save her from Hell in time, it could be thousands of years before her next reincarnation can hope to escape demon life.  Kui restores the chi spirits of the townsfolk stolen by Diaoxian with the Dark Crystal's help, and the disillusioned townsfolk realize that Kui was right to rebel against Diaoxian.  As the time comes for Kui to reincarnate and shed his demon form for good, one of the other gods of the Chinese pantheon confronts him and encourages him to enter Heaven alone.  Kui refuses to ascend to godhood without Snow Girl by his side, so he instead plunges himself into Hell in his demon form in the hopes of finding and saving her before it's too late - accepting the possibility that he too might be trapped for thousands of years in his demon form, yet unwilling to spend any more amount of time anywhere unless Snow is with him.  
Youth (2015 film)
 Septuagenarian best friends Fred Ballinger and Mick Boyle are on vacation in the [[Swiss Alps]], staying at a luxury spa/resort in [[Davos Wiesen|Wiesen]]. Fred is a retired composer of classical music; at the hotel, he is approached by an emissary for [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], conferring a knighthood and asking him to perform his popular piece "Simple Song #3" at [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]]'s birthday concert. Fred turns down the offer, claiming he is not interested in performing any more – although he still composes pieces in his head when alone. Mick is a filmmaker, and is working with a group of writers to develop the screenplay for his latest film, which he calls his "testament". Also with them is actor Jimmy Tree, who is researching for an upcoming role and frustrated that he is only remembered for his role as a robot. The hotel is inhabited by other quirky individuals, including a young masseuse, an overweight [[Diego Maradona]], and [[Miss Universe]].  Fred and Mick reflect on their lives, admitting that their memories are fading and that they see little in their futures. Fred's daughter and assistant, Lena, is married to Mick's son, but the latter leaves her for pop star [[Paloma Faith]]. Lena stays at the resort and vents her anger at her father, who was always distant as she grew up. The emissary returns, and Lena cries as Fred explains that he won't perform "Simple Song #3" because the [[soprano]] part belongs only to his wife and she can no longer sing.  Mick completes his screenplay and is satisfied with it. The main role is written for aging diva Brenda Morel, who has starred in eleven of his previous films. Brenda surprises Mick by arriving at the resort, and telling him that she is taking a television role instead; cinema is the past, she says, and Mick hasn't made a good film in years. Disheartened, Mick commits suicide by jumping off a balcony in front of Fred. Fred decides to visit his wife for the first time in years. She is senile, and living at a [[care home]] in Venice. He then returns to the UK to conduct "Simple Song #3" in front of the Queen and Prince.  Interspersed throughout the film are surreal sequences, including a levitating monk, an imagined Paloma Faith music video, Jimmy dressed as [[Adolf Hitler]], Fred conducting a field of cowbells, and Mick envisioning all his previous leading ladies on a mountaintop (including Brenda, in her new unglamorous TV role).

Zubaan
 The story starts with the flashbacks of a young man, Dilsher ([[Vicky Kaushal]]) who grew up in a village in Gurdaspur, Punjab. His father used to sing in Gurudwaras, but after his death, Dilsher has had developed a fear of music. He instead grows up with a speech impairment due to which he has a tendency of stammering. He comes to Delhi to meet a businessman, Gurcharan "Guru" Sikand ([[Manish Choudhary]]), who is often referred to as the Lion of Gurdaspur. His apparent maternal uncle H.P. Mehta ('''Rajeev Gaur Singh''') tells him that meeting Gurcharan is no ordinary thing to even imagine, let alone do. But this only fuels Dilsher's motivations to meet Gurcharan.  A flashback speaks of how, while being bullied by some of his schoolmates, Dilsher met a young man, Gurcharan Sikand, who told him about how life often becomes cruel to people, and how one should fight back with double the resistance. He even gives Dilsher a pen, which is symbolic of Gurcharan's own struggles, and his audacity to write his own destiny. Dilsher is encouraged to write his own destiny, and thus comes to Delhi after working hard for years.  At an initial stage, Dilsher befriends Tulsi Ram ('''Raj Sharma'''), the leader of a workforce employed in one of Gurcharan's projects, and learns more about Gurcharan from Tulsi Ram. Thereafter, he joins a security agency in hopes of getting to Kapoor Sikand Industries Limited, better known as KSIL, which is owned by Gurcharan. However, he lands a job at a music show somewhat, and notices a young girl, Amira ([[Sarah Jane Dias]]) dancing to a song.  A bouncer, Yadav, is assigned duty at KSIL for the next day. Dilsher begs Yadav to swap positions with him, but Yadav mocks Dilsher for being too enthusiastic, verily questioning his own sensibilities. As part of a last straw, Dilsher injures Yadav when the latter is at a local gym, and Yadav is hospitalized. Dilsher announces himself as a substitute for Yadav, and that very day, while trying to settle an agreement between Tulsi Ram's workforce and Gurcharan's son Surya Sikand ([[Raaghav Chanana]]), he eventually manages to meet Gurcharan, and reminds him of the pen he gave him. Surprised that a stranger would have known him better than his family, Gurcharan is rendered nostalgic, and begins playing a CD of the songs he used to hear in Gurdaspur days.  Tulsi Ram is given a hefty sum to arrange for the MBA studies of his sons. The sum is delivered over by Gurcharan via Dilsher, who uncannily and sinisterly puts a hidden sum in the same red bag. Sometime later, Dilsher decides to leave his maternal uncle and shifts his entire luggage into the construction site at an exact location where Tulsi Ram works. Surya is angry over this and screams loudly at Dilsher, but much to Surya's shock, Gurcharan orders his assistant Ajmani ('''Chittaranjan Tripathy''') to arrange a room beside Ajmani's room in Gurcharan's own estate after he learns that he was ousted by Mehta, who happens to be a name allergic to Gurcharan, after learning that Dilsher was working at KSIL.  During this time, Surya takes Dilsher to a party, where he meets Amira for the first time. She happens to be Surya's friend, but when Surya tries to mock Dilsher, Amira rebukes Surya for his disgusting behaviour. Amira later mentions an event named Dhruvtara, which Surya proclaims he will attend, but Amira refuses, citing that Dhruvtara is only for people who have been close friends to her and Dhruv. Dilsher scans the place, which seems absurd to him, and has a few moments with the drunk and high Amira, but she falls asleep before Dilsher can speak anything. Just as he happens to exit the place, Dilsher is attacked by a few thugs sent by Surya who threaten Dilsher, asking him to leave the estate.  Dilsher visits Amira in the meantime, bringing some bananas for her, and learns that she is preparing for Dhruvtara. Both of them go high on alcohol, and the next morning, Amira discovers Dilsher singing. She falls asleep, and wakes up soon, only to end up stopping Dilsher, who however admits that he is not interested in singing. Amira then reveals that he does not stammer while singing, which soon compels Dilsher to recall his childhood with his father.   Seeing how much Dilsher knows about him, Gurcharan bonds up quickly with him, giving him a higher preference over Surya everywhere, much to the chagrin of Surya's mother Mandira "Mandy" Sikand ([[Meghna Malik]]). Mandy orders Gurcharan to fire Dilsher because Surya doesn't like him, but it falls on deaf ears. However, Dilsher still remains loyal to Gurcharan, who has a high regard for him as he has grown to nearly consider Dilsher his own son. That night, after an argument between Mandy and Gurcharan is stopped, Dilsher is brutally attacked by some goons who seem to have been sent, as usually suspected, by Surya. However, this time, Dilsher challenges Surya in the eye, vowing that he will become a big man, and that Surya has nothing worth being like his father. A broken Surya then ceases communication with Gurcharan, who is already angry with him for having sent goons against Dilsher.  Dilsher meets Amira again, this time on his own and in person. He learns that Dhruv was Amira's brother, who for a reason did not like Surya, but was very reactive and aggressive when drunk. During a party, he accidentally fell off into a swimming pool and blood started flowing out from his head. After a few days, Gurcharan hosts a party where the [[Les Twins]] are to perform. Dilsher tries to apologize to Surya, but leaves him alone in the weak moment. Meanwhile, Gurcharan goes furious when he notices Mehta at the party, trying to meet with Mandy, who but warns Gurcharan against creating a scene, and he leaves in disgust.    Dilsher is confronted by Gurcharan and soon reveals that he was the one who injured Yadav to meet him, and Gurcharan, in turn, reveals a number of truths to him : Surya is actually Mandy's son with Mehta, and that Mehta actually belonged earlier to the Kapoor family from KSIL, something which is why he doesn't love Surya and Mandy because Gurcharan saw his efforts being credited to the undeserving. However, Dilsher is devastated to learn that the goons that day were actually sent by Gurcharan, and not Surya. After a lengthy conversation, Dilsher realizes that KSIL is not the place for him. Instead, he picks up at Amira during her performance with the dancer duo. As the song ends, the two share a kiss.  Recalling through another flashback how his father developed a speech impairment that led to his banishment from the Gurudwara and ultimately desolation resulting in suicide, Dilsher finally lets go of it all as he realizes the lesson Amira gave him on music and life. He leaves Gurcharan for a new life, thus also incriminating Gurcharan with Surya and Mandy. Although he is arrested and imprisoned upon arrival in Gurdaspur under charges pressed by Gurcharan, he is soon released, and writes a message to Amira, finally reuniting with her in the end.
