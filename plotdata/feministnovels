Ann Veronica
  Mr. Stanley forbids his adult daughter, a biology student at Tredgold Women's College and the youngest of his five children, to attend a fancy dress ball in London, causing a crisis. Ann Veronica is planning to attend the dance with friends of a down-at-heel artistic family living nearby and has been chafing at other restrictions imposed for no apparent reason on her. After her father resorts to force to stop her from attending the ball, she leaves her home in the fictional south London suburb of Morningside Park in order to live independently in an apartment "in a street near the Hampstead Road" in North London.<ref>H. G. Wells, ''Ann Veronica'', Ch. 5, §6.</ref> Unable to find appropriate employment, she borrows forty pounds from Mr. Ramage, an older man, without realizing she is compromising herself.  With this money, Ann Veronica is able to devote herself to study in the biological laboratory of the Central Imperial College (a constituent college of [[London University]]) where she meets and falls in love with Capes, the laboratory's "demonstrator."<ref>H. G. Wells, ''Ann Veronica'', Ch. 8.</ref> But Mr. Ramage loses little time in trying to take advantage of the situation, precipitating a crisis. Distraught after Ramage tries to force himself on her, Ann Veronica temporarily abandons her studies and devotes herself to the cause of women's suffrage; she is arrested storming Parliament and spends a month in prison.  Sobered by the experience, Ann Veronica convinces herself of the necessity of compromise. She returns to her father's home and engages herself to marry an admirer she does not love, Hubert Manning. But she soon changes her mind, renounces the engagement, and boldly tells Capes she loves him.  Though he returns Ann Veronica's love, at first the thirty-year-old Capes insists on the impossibility of the situation:  he is a married (albeit separated) man with a sullied reputation because of an affair that became public. They can only be friends, he declares. But Ann Veronica is undeterred by his confession and his prudence, and finally Capes's resistance buckles:  "She stood up and held her arms toward him. 'I want you to kiss me,' she said. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 'I want you. I want you to be my lover. I want to give myself to you. I want to be whatever I can to you.'  She paused for a moment. 'Is that plain?' she asked."<ref>H. G. Wells, ''Ann Veronica'', Ch. 14, §5.</ref>  Capes decides to throw over his employment at the college in order to live with Ann Veronica, and they enjoy a glorious "honeymoon" in the Alps. A final chapter shows the happy couple four years and four months later living in London. Capes has become a successful playwright, and Ann Veronica is pregnant and has reconciled with her family.

Caballero: A Historical Novel
 The novel consists of a forward and thirty-six chapters. In chronological sequence, it interweaves both historical and fictional events that occurred near or in other ways impacted the [[Mexico-United States border]] in the late 1840s.  The forward establishes the history of the Mendoza family's presence in [[Texas]]. This commences in 1748, when Don José Ramón de Mendoza y Robles, a Spanish [[conquistador|explorer]], receives permission from the [[viceroy]] in [[Mexico City]] to lead an expedition of wealthy landowners to the land between the [[Rio Grande]] and [[Nueces River|Nueces]] rivers. The land he claims for himself he names the Rancho La Palma de Cristo. Soon after, he marries the blonde and green-eyed Susanita Ulloa, who is his junior by many years, and they have one son who survives childhood, named Francisco. Francisco marries Amalia Soría, who bears him three children—Santiago, Dolores and Ramón—before she dies. Santiago, Dolores and Ramón are raised by their grandmother, Susanita, who instills in them their grandfather's greatness and the importance of upholding one's [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith. Susanita, Francisco and Ramón have all died before the novel's proper beginning, leaving the Rancho La Palma completely under Don Santiago's care.  Chapter One introduces us to Don Santiago, the uncontested patriarch of Rancho La Palma, and his family. He, like his father and grandfather before him, has also married a pureblooded Spanish woman, Doña María Petronilla, who is characterized by her simple and unprepossessing dresses. They have four children, all of whom are in their teenage years. Two of these are sons—Alvaro and Luis Gonzaga—and two are daughters—María de los Ángeles and Susanita. Susanita, like the grandmother whose name she shares, is blonde and green-eyed. She is described as Don Santiago's "dearest" child<ref>See González & Raleigh 5.</ref> and as he watches her join the family for dinner, he glumly acknowledges that time has come to find her a husband.  Dinner is interrupted by Don Gabriel del Lago, a friend of Don Santiago's and a neighboring Spanish-Mexican landowner, who brings news that [[Texas]] has been taken from Mexico by the [[United States|Americans]], and that [[United States|American]] soldiers under the leadership of [[Zachary Taylor]] have infiltrated the territory and are busy establishing defensive outposts. Each of the characters responds to this turn of events differently: Don Santiago scoffs, refusing to consider [[United States|Americans]] any threat to his way of life; Alvaro wants to know what military action can be undertaken to stave off the [[United States|American]] forces; Luis Gonzaga contemplates whether or not [[United States|Americans]] really are the uncultured hoodlums he has heard them to be; María de los Ángeles, under the assumption that [[United States|Americans]] are not [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], assumes the invasion is punishment from [[God]] for Mexico's sins; and Susanita wonders what it would be like to dance with a tall white-skinned man.  The narrative that unfolds tracks these characters, and others, as their suspicions about the invading forces are explored—sometimes confirmed, but more often reformed.

 The beautiful orphan Albertine comes into contact with the austere young Marcel at a Normandy seaside hotel, whilst on holiday with friends. She soon becomes embroiled in a destructive affair with the young man, trapping them both in his Paris apartment. His jealousy and her strong will and bisexual attraction to others cause both unhappiness. A gynocentric revisiting of Proust, it is a feminist re-imagining, giving Albertine a voice she has been denied.  
The Bathing Women
 ''The Bathing Women'' focuses on the main character Tiao, a Beijing publisher who on chance begins an affair with the older married actor Feng Jing, her sister Fan and her long term friend Fei, as they grow up in the chaos of [[The Cultural Revolution]]. The novel is set simultaneously in the 1960s and 1980s China. The novel confronts the themes of misogyny, gender roles and double standards of Chinese culture.  The novel opens with the protagonist Tiao, a successful executive for a Beijing publishing company, entering into an affair with the married actor Feng Jing. Feng Jing is internationally acclaimed for his portrayal of the hardships of the victims of the Cultural Revolution based on his own experiences in a labor camp at the time. Throughout their relationship Feng Jing promises Tiao that he will leave his wife to marry her.  The setting of the novel flashes back to a moment in Tiao's youth, in which she witnesses the public denouncement of one of her school's teachers, Tang Jingjing. Ms. Tang had recently had a daughter out of wedlock and is labelled as a  "female hooligan". As punishment for her transgression she is given a choice: either reveal the name of the father of her daughter or be forced to consume feces, Ms. Tang not wanting to humiliate her daughter, chooses the latter.  Chapter 2 of ''The Bathing Women'' focuses on Tiao and her sister Fan's early childhood, in particular their relationship to their father Yixun and their mother Wu. Yixun, a successful architect is denounced as a class enemy and sent to the labor camp [[Down to the Countryside Movement|Reed River Farm]] to be "reeducated through labor." During this time Wu develops an illness in which she suddenly becomes dizzy and collapses, which allows her a brief period of leave from the camp to return to her family. Wu, frightened by the idea of returning to the camp seduces her physician Doctor Tang, who reciprocates by turning in a false diagnosis to the government that Wu suffers from a chronic heart condition, thus allowing her to be spared from returning.  Despite returning to her children, Wu routinely ignores them in favor of pursuing her relationship with Dr. Tang, enraging Tiao who sees her mother as betraying her father. The tension between mother and daughter reaches a climax as Fan develops a serious illness while her mother is visiting her lover, leading to Tiao to scream at her mother, claiming that Fan's illness is entirely the fault of her mother.  Tiao befriends Dr. Tang's niece, Fei, an attractive and luxuriously dressed high school girl. Despite Tiao's animosity to Dr. Tang for having an affair with her mother, Tiao soon finds Fei to be her closest friend, often spending hours with her and Youyou, reading prohibited Soviet magazines for recipes.  During this time Wu becomes pregnant with her third daughter Quan, the pregnancy is immediately regarded with suspicion by all members of the family, who believe that Dr. Tang had fathered the child not Yiuan. Quan is routinely mistreated by both Fan and Tiao who view her as an example of their mother's infidelity. While the sisters watch Quan play in the street one day, they witness her fall into an open sewer, dying instantly. This moment would act as a strong motivator for both Fan and Tiao who feel as though they had both murdered their mistreated sister.

The Color Purple
 Celie is a poor, uneducated 14-year-old girl living in the American South in the early 1900s. She writes letters to God because her stepfather, Alphonso, beats her harshly and rapes her continously. Alphonso has already impregnated Celie once, a pregnancy that resulted in the birth of a boy she named Adam. Alphonso takes the baby away shortly after his birth. Celie has a second child, a girl she named Olivia whom Alphonso also abducts. Celie's ailing mother dies after cursing Celie on her deathbed.  Celie and her younger sister, 12-year-old Nettie, learn that a man identified only as Mister wants to marry Nettie. Alphonso refuses to let Nettie marry, instead arranging for Mister to marry Celie. Mister, needing someone to care for his children and keep his house, eventually accepts the offer. Mister and his children, whose mother was murdered by a jealous lover, all treat Celie badly. However, she eventually gets Mister's squalid living conditions and incorrigible children under control.  Shortly thereafter, Nettie runs away from Alphonso and takes refuge at Celie's house, where Mister makes sexual advances toward her. Celie then advises Nettie to seek assistance from a well-dressed black woman that she had seen in the general store a while back; the woman had unknowingly adopted Celie's daughter and was the only black woman that Celie had ever seen with money of her own. Nettie is forced to leave after promising to write. Celie, however, never receives any letters and concludes that her sister is dead.  Time passes and Mister's children begin to grow up and leave home. Harpo, Mister's son, falls in love with an assertive girl named Sofia, who becomes pregnant with Harpo's baby and, despite initial resistance from Mister, marries Harpo. Harpo and Sofia have five more children in short order.  Celie is amazed by Sofia's defiant refusal to submit to Harpo's attempts to control her. Kinder and gentler than his father, Harpo feels emasculated due to his inability to get Sofia to "mind." Celie advises Harpo not to try to dominate Sofia; she also tells Harpo that Sofia loves him, admitting that she, Celie, only obeys Mister out of fear. Harpo temporarily follows Celie's advice but falls back under Mister's sway. A momentarily jealous Celie then advises Harpo to beat Sofia. Sofia fights back, however, inflicting serious injuries on Harpo.  After Sofia confronts her, Celie, who was already feeling guilty about what she had done, apologizes and confides in her about all the abuse she suffers at Mister's hands. She also begins to consider Sofia's advice about defending herself against further abuse from Mister.  Glamorous Shug Avery, a jazz and blues singer and Mister's long-time mistress, falls ill, and Mister takes her into his house. Celie, who had been fascinated by photos of Shug she found in Mister's belongings, is thrilled to have her there. Mister's father expresses disapproval of the arrangement, reminding Mister that Shug has three out-of-wedlock children. Mister proudly states that he knows for certain that all the children have the same father, indirectly admitting to being their father. Mister's father leaves in disgust after drinking a glass of water into which Celie spit. While Shug is initially rude to Celie, who has taken charge of nursing her, the two women become friends, and Celie soon finds herself infatuated with Shug.  Frustrated by Harpo's domineering behavior, Sofia moves out, taking her children with her. Several months later, Harpo opens a juke joint where a fully recovered Shug performs nightly. Shug decides to stay when she learns that Mister beats Celie when she is away. Shug and Celie's relationship grows more intimate.  Sofia returns for a visit and promptly gets into a fight with Harpo's new girlfriend, Squeak, knocking Squeak's teeth out. In town one day, while Sofia is enjoying a day out with her new beau, a prizefighter, and their respective children, the mayor's wife, Miss Millie, approaches the group. She begins to "finger" Sofia's children (physically examine them in a way reminiscent of slaves on an auction block) without bothering, at first, to speak to their mother or ask permission. At first, Sofia silently endures. Miss Millie then looks up and addresses Sofia, remarking on how clean the children are and bluntly asks Sofia if she would like to be her maid.   Sofia, who does not work as a maid, straightforwardly refuses saying "Hell no." The mayor then pushes his wife aside, calling Sofia "girl" and daring her to repeat herself. When Sofia does so defiantly, the mayor slaps Sofia. Sofia responds by using her fist to knock the mayor, her assailant, onto the ground. The police quickly arrive at the scene and brutally beat Sofia as she pleads with the prizefighter not to intervene on her behalf and instead to take her children to safety. Sofia emerges from her ordeal with a cracked skull, broken ribs, her face rendered nearly unrecognizable, and blind in one eye. Sofia is subsequently sentenced to 12 years in jail.  Squeak, a mixed-race woman and Sheriff Hodges' illegitimate niece, attempts to blackmail the sheriff into releasing Sofia, resulting in her being raped by the sheriff. Squeak cares for Sofia's children while she is incarcerated, and the two women develop a friendship. Sofia is eventually released and begins working for Miss Millie, which she detests.  Despite being newly married to a person called Grady, Shug instigates a sexual relationship with Celie on her next visit. One night Shug asks Celie about her sister, and Shug helps Celie recover letters from Nettie that Mister has been hiding from her for decades.  The letters indicate that Nettie befriended a missionary couple, Samuel and Corrine, the well-dressed woman that Celie saw in the store, whom Nettie eventually accompanied to Africa to do missionary work. Samuel and Corrine have unwittingly adopted Celie's son and daughter (by Celie's father), Adam and Olivia. Corrine, noticing that her adopted children resemble Nettie, wonders if Samuel fathered the children with her. Increasingly suspicious, Corrine tries to limit Nettie's role in her family.  Through her letters, Nettie reveals that she has become disillusioned with her missionary work. Corrine becomes ill with a fever. Nettie asks Samuel to tell her how he adopted Olivia and Adam. Realizing that Adam and Olivia are Celie's children, Nettie then learns that Alphonso is her and Celie's stepfather. Their biological father was a store owner whom white men lynched because they resented his success. She also learns that their mother suffered a mental collapse after the death of her husband and that Alphonso exploited the situation in order to control their mother's considerable wealth.  Nettie confesses to Samuel and Corrine that she is in fact their children's biological aunt. The gravely ill Corrine refuses to believe her until Nettie reminds her of her previous encounter with Celie in the store. Later, Corrine dies, finally having accepted Nettie's story. Meanwhile, Celie visits Alphonso, who confirms Nettie's story. Celie begins to lose some of her faith in God, which she confides to Shug, who explains to Celie her own unique religious philosophy.  Celie, having had enough of her husband's abuse, decides to leave Mister along with Shug and Squeak, who is considering a singing career of her own. Celie puts a curse on Mister before leaving him for good.  Celie settles in Tennessee and supports herself as a seamstress. She learns that Mister, suffering from a considerable decline in fortunes after Celie left him, has changed dramatically and Celie begins to call him by his first name, Albert. Albert proposes that they marry "in the spirit as well as in the flesh," but Celie declines.  Alphonso dies, Celie inherits his land, and moves back into her childhood home. Around this time, Shug falls in love with Germaine, a member of her band, and the news thereof crushes Celie. Shug travels with Germaine, all the while writing postcards to Celie. Celie pledges to love Shug even if Shug does not love her back.  Meanwhile, Nettie and Samuel marry and prepare to return to America. Before they leave, Adam marries Tashi, an African girl. Following an African tradition, Tashi undergoes the painful rituals of female circumcision and facial scarring. In solidarity, Adam undergoes the same facial scarring ritual.  Just after Celie realizes that she is content in her life without Shug, Shug returns, having ended things with Germaine. The end of the novel has Nettie, Samuel, Olivia, Adam, and Tashi arriving at Celie's house. Nettie and Celie embrace, having not seen each other for over 30 years. They introduce one another to their respective families as the novel ends.  
Dolores Claiborne
 Dolores Claiborne, an opinionated 65-year-old widow living on the tiny Maine community of Little Tall Island, is suspected of murdering her wealthy, elderly employer, Vera Donovan. The novel is presented as a transcript of her statement, told to the local constable and a stenographer. Dolores wants to make clear to the police that she did not kill Vera, whom she has looked after for years, but does confess to orchestrating the death of her husband, Joe St. George, almost 30 years before. Dolores's confession develops into the story of her life, her troubled marriage, and her relationship with her employer.   She begins by describing her relationship with her employer, which began when Vera and her millionaire husband purchased a summer home on Little Tall Island in 1949 and hired Dolores as a maid. Able to cope with Vera's brutally exacting standards, Dolores rises from maid to housekeeper at the Donovan home. After her husband's death in a car crash in the late 50s, Vera spends increasing time at her island house, eventually moving in permanently. After Vera suffers a series of strokes in the 1980s, Dolores becomes Vera's live-in caretaker and reluctant companion as the wealthy woman slips into dementia, combatting Vera's mind games and power plays when she is lucid and comforting her from terrifying hallucinations of a force she calls "the dust bunnies" when she is not.   Dolores further reveals that at the time she began working for Vera, her marriage to Joe St. George was already showing signs of distress due to Joe's drinking and his penchant for verbal and physical abuse. Their issues come to a head one night in 1960 when Joe viciously hits Dolores in the small of her back with a piece of stove wood over a perceived slight. In retaliation, Dolores smashes a ceramic cream pot over his head and threatens him with a hatchet, swearing she will kill him if he ever strikes her again. This confrontation is witnessed by their teenage daughter Selena, who does not realize her mother was acting in self-defense. Joe stops beating Dolores, though she allows him to let the island community believe he continues to do so in an effort to save face, but leads to a rift between mother and daughter.  In 1962, Dolores notices that Selena has become increasingly withdrawn, frightened and anti-social. After speculating that she has met a boy or become involved in drugs, Dolores finally confronts her daughter as they return home on the island ferry. She explains the truth of the hatchet incident, which Joe has used to gain sympathy with his daughter, and Selena unwillingly confesses that her father has molested her. A hysterical Selena nearly jumps off the side of the ferry, but Dolores prevents her and comforts her, vowing to protect her. That night, she considers murdering Joe on the spot, describing the urge to kill him as the opening of an "inside eye". Instead, she confronts him, promising to have him arrested if he ever touches Selena again.    Dolores resolves to protect her children by leaving Joe, but when she attempts to withdraw her children's savings accounts to fund their escape, she discovers Joe has stolen everything she had saved. In despair, she breaks down crying at work, forcing her to confide her troubles in Vera. An unusually sympathetic Vera reveals she has had some sort of experience with Dolores' "inside eye", and casually remarks that men like Joe often die in accidents, leaving their wives everything. As she departs, she implies that she arranged the car crash that killed her husband and advises Dolores that "sometimes, an accident can be an unhappy woman's best friend."  Dolores begins plotting Joe's death, but does not find an opportunity to put her plan into action until the summer of 1963. Vera becomes obsessed with a [[Solar eclipse of July 20, 1963|total solar eclipse]] that will be visible from the island, convinced the event will convince her estranged children to visit her. She plans a massive viewing party on the Island ferry. Knowing that the Island will be mostly empty as a result, Delores ensures Selena is sent to camp and her sons, Joe Jr. and Pete, are sent on a trip to visit family, and marks the location of a dried-up stone well in a patch of brambles on the edge of their property. When it becomes clear her children will not be joining her, Vera becomes despondent and lashes out at her hired help, calming only after Dolores confronts her over the unjust firing of one of the maids.   On the day of the eclipse, Dolores buys Joe a bottle of fine scotch and makes him a sandwich, getting him drunk and comfortable, and they share a moment of physical affection for the first time in many years. As the eclipse begins, Dolores has a vision of [[Gerald's Game|a young girl]] in the path of the eclipse who is at that same moment being sexually abused by her father. Reminded of what she has set out to do, she deliberately enrages Joe by claiming she has recovered the money he had stolen and provokes him into attacking her. She flees into the brambles, leading Joe to the well and tricking him into stepping on the rotted boards that cover it. The planks break and he falls into the well, but is not instantly killed. He calls out for help for some time before eventually falling unconscious. Dolores returns to the house and falls asleep, but has a nightmare and forces herself to go outside to check the well. She arrives to discover Joe has regained consciousness, and has managed to nearly climb out of the well, grabbing at Dolores and attempting to pull her in with him. She finally kills him by hitting him in the face with a rock, and he falls back into the well.  Dolores reports Joe missing, and his body is found after several days of searching. Dolores is suspected of killing her husband, but Joe's death is ruled an accident despite the suspicions of the local coroner and the rumor mill of Little Tall Island. Dolores is free of Joe, but her actions damage her relationship with Selena, who suspects her mother killed her father.  Dolores finally comes to the circumstances of Vera's death, which have led her to tell her story. She confesses that Vera, in one of her hallucinations, had managed to get out of her wheelchair and flees in terror from "the dust bunnies", falling down a flight of stairs. As Vera falls, Dolores has a terrifying vision of Joe's ghost covered in dust. Somehow alive and lucid despite her injuries, Vera begs Dolores to help her end her suffering. Dolores fetches a rolling pin, but Vera dies before she can use it. The incriminating scene is discovered by the local mailman, who clearly suspects Dolores of killing the old woman, and forces her to call the police. That night, Dolores begins to be harassed and threatened by members of the island community, who already believe she has gotten away with murder. The next day, Dolores receives a phone call from Vera's lawyer, who informs a shocked Dolores that she has inherited Vera's entire fortune, which amounts to nearly 30 million dollars. Dolores attempts to refuse the money in favor of Vera's estranged children. She is dumbfounded to learn that they were killed in a car crash in 1961, and Vera had spent the last 40 years of her life pretending that they were still alive. Knowing that the inheritance would have given her a motive for murder and worsen the case against her, Dolores convinces herself that the only way to clear her name is to confess everything. Feeling at peace with herself at long last, she ends her statement.   Several newspaper articles provide an epilogue to the story, revealing that Dolores was cleared of any blame in Vera's death and that she anonymously donated Vera's entire fortune to the New England [[The Home for Little Wanderers | Home For Little Wanderers]]. The final article implies Dolores and Selena have reconciled and that Selena will be coming home for the first time in twenty years.  
Fanny Hill
  Frances "Fanny" Hill is a rich Englishwoman in her middle age, who leads a life of contentment with her loving husband Charles and their children. The novel consists of two long letters (which appear as volumes I and II of the original edition) addressed by Fanny to an unnamed acquaintance, who is only identified as 'Madam.' Fanny has been prevailed upon by the 'Madam' to recount the 'scandalous stages' of her earlier life, which she proceeds to do with 'stark naked truth' as her governing principle.  Fanny's account begins with the loss of her parents at the age of 14 followed by a journey to London, and ends with her union with Charles about five years later. The intermediate narrative is filled with many sexual experiences, which are described with vividness, whimsy, wit and humour. Metaphors and similies are used to describe sexual organs and activities.  The plot was described as 'operatic' by [[John Hollander]], who said that "the book's language and its protagonist's character are its greatest virtues."<ref>Hollander, John: The old last act: some observations on Fanny Hill, Encounter, October 1963.</ref>  The first letter begins with a short account of Fanny's impoverished childhood in a village in [[Lancashire]]. She loses her parents to small-pox, arrives in London to look for domestic work, and gets lured into a brothel. She sees a sexual encounter between an ugly older couple and another between a young attractive couple, and participates in a lesbian encounter with Phoebe, a bisexual prostitute. A customer, Charles, induces Fanny to escape.  She loses her virginity to Charles and becomes his lover. Charles is sent away by deception to the South Seas, and Fanny is driven by desperation and poverty to become the kept woman of a rich merchant named Mr H—. After enjoying a brief period of stability, she sees Mr H— have a sexual encounter with her own maid, and goes on to seduce Will (the young footman of Mr H—) as an act of revenge. She is discovered by Mr H— as she is having a sexual encounter with Will. After being abandoned by Mr H—, Fanny becomes a prostitute for wealthy and discerning clients in a pleasure-house run by Mrs Cole. This marks the end of the first letter.  The second letter begins with a rumination on the tedium of writing about sex and the difficulty of driving a middle course between vulgar language and "mincing metaphors and affected circumlocutions". Fanny then describes her adventures in the house of Mrs Cole, which include a public orgy, an elaborately orchestrated bogus sale of her "virginity" to a rich dupe called Mr Norbert, and a sado-masochistic session with a man involving mutual flagellation with birch-rods. These are interspersed with narratives which do not involve Fanny directly; for instance, three other girls in the house (Emily, Louisa and Harriett) describe their own losses of virginity, and the nyphomaniac Louisa seduces the immensely endowed but imbecilic "good-natured Dick". Literary critic Felicity A. Nussbaum describes the girls in Mrs Cole's brothel as "'a little troop of love' who provide compliments, caresses, and congratulation to their fellow whores' erotic achievements".<ref></ref> Fanny also describes anal intercourse between two young boys. (This was removed from several later editions) According to literary critic Thomas Holmes, Fanny and Mrs Cole see the homosexual act thusly: "the act subverts not only the hierarchy of the male over the female, but also what they consider nature's law regarding the role of intercourse and procreation".<ref>{{cite journal   |title = Sexual Positions and Sexual Politics: John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure   |last = Holmes   |first = Thomas Alan   |journal = [[South Atlantic Review]]   |publisher = [[South Atlantic Modern Language Association]]   |issn = 0277-335X   |eissn = 2325-7970   |volume = 74   |issue = 1   |year = 2009   |pages = 124–139   |jstor = 27784834      |subscription = yes   |ref = harv }}</ref> Eventually Fanny retires from prostitution and becomes the lover of a rich and worldly-wise man of 60 (described by Fanny as a "rational pleasurist"). This phase of Fanny's life brings about her intellectual development, and leaves her wealthy when her lover dies of a sudden cold. Soon after, she has a chance encounter with Charles, who has returned as a poor man to England after being shipwrecked. Fanny offers her fortune to Charles unconditionally, but he insists on marrying her.  The novel's developed characters include Charles, Mrs Jones (Fanny's landlady), Mrs Cole, Will, Mr H— and Mr Norbert. The prose includes long sentences with many subordinate clauses. Its morality is conventional for the time, in that it denounces sodomy, frowns upon vice and approves of only heterosexual unions based upon mutual love.<ref>Cleland John, Memoirs of a woman of pleasure, ed. Peter Sabor, Oxford University Press, 1985.</ref>  
The Edible Woman
 Marian MacAlpin works in a market research firm, writing survey questions and sampling products. She shares the top-floor apartment of a house in [[Toronto]] with her roommate Ainsley and dates a dependable and boring boyfriend, Peter. Marian also keeps in touch with Clara, a friend from college, who is now a constantly pregnant housewife.  Ainsley announces she wants to have a baby&nbsp;– and intends to do it without getting married. When Marian is horrified, Ainsley replies, "The thing that ruins families these days is the husbands." Looking for a man who will have no interest in fatherhood, she sets her sights on Marian's "womanizer" friend Len, who is infamous for his relationships with young, naive girls.  At work, Marian is assigned the task of [[market research|gathering responses for a survey]] about a new type of beer. While walking from house to house asking people their opinions, she meets Duncan, a graduate student in English who intrigues her with his atypical and eccentric answers.  Marian later has a dinner date with Peter and Len, during which Ainsley shows up dressed as a virginal schoolgirl&nbsp;– the first stage of her plan to trick Len into impregnating her. Marian finds herself disassociating from her body as Peter recounts a gory rabbit hunt to Len:  <blockquote>"''After a while I noticed that a large drop of something wet had materialized on the table. I poked it with my finger and smudged it around a little before I realized with horror that it was a tear.''"<ref name="Atwood" /></blockquote>  Marian runs from the restaurant and is chased down by Peter in his car. Unaware of Ainsley's plan to get pregnant by Len, Peter chides, "Ainsley behaved herself properly, why couldn't you?"  At the end of the night, Peter proposes to her. When asked to choose a date for the wedding, Marian slips into unexpected passivity:  <blockquote>''"'I’d rather have you decide that. I’d rather leave the big decisions up to you.' I was astonished at myself. I’d never said anything remotely like that to him before. The funny thing was that I really meant it."''<ref name="Atwood" /></blockquote>  Marian and Duncan have a surprise meeting in a laundromat, engage in awkward conversation, and kiss. Shortly afterwards, Marian's problems with food begin when she finds herself empathizing with a steak that Peter is eating, imagining it "knocked on the head as it stood in a queue like someone waiting for a streetcar." After this, she is unable to eat meat&nbsp;– anything with "bone or tendon or fiber".  Ainsley's plot to seduce Len succeeds. When Len later learns that Ainsley is pregnant, he talks to Marian, who confesses that pregnancy was Ainsley's plan all along. Len reveals his childhood fear of eggs, and from that point Marian can no longer face her soft-boiled egg in the morning. Soon thereafter, she is unable to eat vegetables or cake.  Peter decides to throw a party, to which Marian invites "the office virgins" from her work, Duncan, and Duncan's roommates. Peter suggests that Marian buy herself a new dress for his party&nbsp;– something less "mousy" than her normal wardrobe. Marian submits to his wishes and buys a daring red dress. Before the party, Ainsley does Marian's makeup, including false eyelashes and a big lipsticked smile. When Duncan arrives, he says, "You didn't tell me it was a masquerade. Who the hell are you supposed to be?" He leaves and Marian follows. They end up going to a sleazy hotel, where they have unsatisfying sex. The next morning, they go out to breakfast and Marian finds that she cannot eat anything.  After Duncan leaves, Marian realizes that Peter is metaphorically devouring her. To test him, she bakes a pink cake in the shape of a woman and dares him to eat it. "This is what you really want", she says, offering the cake woman as a substitute to him feeding upon her. Peter leaves disturbed. Marian eats the cake herself.  Marian returns to her first person narrative in the closing pages of the book. Duncan shows up at her apartment; Marian offers him the remains of the cake, which he polishes off. "'Thank you,' he said, licking his lips. 'It was delicious.'"  
Efuru
  The story is set in West African Igbo rural community. The protagonist, Efuru, is a strong and beautiful woman. She is the daughter of Nwashike Ogene, a hero and leader of his tribe. She falls in love with a poor farmer called Adizua and runs away with him, upsetting her people as he did not even perform the traditional wine carrying and pay her bride price. She supports her husband financially and is very loyal to him, which makes her mother-in-law and aunt by marriage very fond of her. At this point, she accepts to be helped around her house by a young girl named Ogea in order to help her parents who are in financial difficulty. However, Adizua soon abandons Efuru and their daughter Ogonim as his own father has done in past. After her daughter dies, Efuru discovers that he has married another woman and had a child with her. Her in-laws try to convince her to stay with him, i.e. remain in waiting in their marital house. Efuru then tries to look for him, but after failing, she leaves his house and goes back to the house of her father who receives her happily as she can care for him better than others. Efuru then meets Gilbert, an educated man in her age group. He asks to marry her and follows traditions by visiting her father, and she accepts. The first year of their marriage is a happy one. However, Efuru is not able to conceive any children, so this begins to cause trouble. She is later chosen by the goddess of the lake, [[Uhamiri]], to be one of her worshipers, Uhamiri being known to offer her worshipers wealth and beauty but few children. Efuru’s second marriage eventually also fails as her husband mistreats her in favor of his second and third wives.

Dirty Weekend (novel)
 Overturning the traditional notion of a pleasurable sex-filled dirty weekend, Zahavi's novel instead examines a weekend killing spree committed by Bella, a twenty-something former sex-worker. She is targeted by men who [[sexual abuse|sexually abuse]] women, but kills them instead of letting them victimize her. Over the course of the weekend she murders seven men through a variety of gruesome methods. In the end she escapes to a new life in the large, faceless city of [[London]].  In the novel the old [[picaresque novel|picaresque]] tradition is revived: there is one central character, Bella, the ''picara'', who is the only link to all the other characters. She meets and confronts one man after the other, kills him, and moves on to the next.  
Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe
 Throughout the novel the narrator and time period change, and the reader relies on the chapters' headings to establish the date and the source of the chapter. Some of the narration comes in the form of the fictional newsletter called "The Weems Weekly"; other narrations come from the Couches' house in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], and omniscient narrations reveal still more. The framing story, set in the mid-1980s, depicts Evelyn Couch, who goes weekly with her husband to visit his mother in a nursing home. On one visit, Evelyn befriends Ninny Threadgoode, another resident of the same home, who tells Evelyn stories of her youth in Whistle Stop in the 1920s. Between subsequent visits, Evelyn assumes the protagonists of these stories as role models.  According to Ninny, she was an orphan raised by the Threadgoodes, and eventually married one of their sons; but the principal character throughout her story is the youngest daughter, Idgie (Imogene) Threadgoode: an unrepentant tomboy, became reclusive after her brother, Buddy, was killed on the railway. Ruth Jamison comes to live with the family while teaching at the [[Vacation Bible School]]. Idgie gradually becomes enamored of her and is saddened when Ruth leaves Whistle Stop to marry Frank Bennett. Frank turns out to be a violent, abusive man who often beats Ruth. She remains faithful to Frank until her mother's death. Subsequently, Ruth sends Idgie a message, and Idgie, along with several others, rescue her. Intimidated by Big George, the family's handyman and café cook, Frank does not resist.   With money from her father, Idgie establishes the Whistle Stop Cafe, with Sipsey (George's adoptive mother) and her daughter-in-law Onzell as cooks, and becomes secondary guardian to Ruth's son, Buddy Jr. (known as 'Stump' after losing an arm in an accident). The café quickly became known to hobos all over the U.S. during [[The Great Depression]] as a welcome place to find a meal. The most recurrent is 'Smokey Lonesome' Phillips, who secretly loves Ruth. When Ruth dies of cancer, Idgie is heartbroken.   After the railroad yard closes, the cafe (and ultimately the town) ceases operation. Several years later, Idgie and Big George are arrested for Frank Bennett's murder; but the case is dismissed when the local minister, repaying Idgie for helping his son, testifies (falsely) that she and Big George were at a three-day [[Revival meeting|revival]] when Frank Bennett went missing. Bennett's body was never found, but it is later revealed that Sipsey killed him when he attempted to claim his and Ruth's son. His remains were barbecued by George and fed to the detectives investigating Frank's disappearance. Stump recounts the stories of his guardians to his daughter and granddaughter; Big George's sons, Jasper and Artis [sic], have their own careers: Jasper as a Sleeping Car Porter, and Artis as a gambler.  Inspired by these stories, Evelyn starts selling [[Mary Kay Cosmetics]] and, at Mrs. Threadgoode's urging, is treated for menopause and confronts various long-held fears. Evelyn becomes happier. While on vacation, she receives a letter from Mrs. Hartman, Mrs. Threadgoode's neighbor, that Mrs. Threadgoode has died and left various trinkets for Evelyn. The novel's conclusion reveals that Idgie and her brother Julian, after Whistle Stop became depopulated, operated a roadside food-stand.  
The Hours (novel)
 [[Image:Virginia Woolf 1927.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Portrait of Virginia Woolf (January 25, 1882 – March 28, 1941), British author and feminist.]] The book concerns three generations of women affected by the classic novel ''[[Mrs. Dalloway]]''.  In [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], 1923, Author Virginia Woolf is writing ''[[Mrs. Dalloway]]'' and struggling with her own [[mental illness]]. In 1949 Los Angeles, Mrs. Brown, wife of a World War II [[war veteran|veteran]], who is reading ''Mrs. Dalloway'', plans her husband's [[party#Birthday party|birthday party]]. In 1999 New York City, Clarissa Vaughan plans a party to celebrate a major literary award received by her good friend and former lover, the poet Richard, who is dying of an AIDS-related illness.  The situations of all three characters mirror situations experienced by Woolf's Clarissa Dalloway in ''Mrs. Dalloway'', with Clarissa Vaughan being a very literal modern-day version of Woolf's character. Like Mrs. Dalloway, Clarissa Vaughan goes on a journey to buy flowers while reflecting on the minutiae of the day around her and later prepares to throw a party. Clarissa Dalloway and Clarissa Vaughan also both reflect on their histories and past loves in relation to their current lives, which they both perceive as trivial. A number of other characters in Clarissa Vaughan's story also parallel characters in Woolf's ''Mrs. Dalloway.''  Cunningham's novel also mirrors ''Mrs. Dalloway's'' [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] narrative style (a style pioneered by Woolf and [[James Joyce]]) in which the flowing thoughts and perceptions of [[protagonists]] are depicted as they would occur in real life, unfiltered, flitting from one thing to another, and often rather unpredictable. In terms of time, this means characters interact not only with the [[present]], but also memories; this [[Context (language use)|contextualizes]] personal history and backstory, which otherwise might appear quite trivial—buying flowers, baking a cake and such things.  Cunningham's novel also uses the device in Woolf's ''Mrs. Dalloway'' of placing the action of the novel within the space of one day. In Woolf's ''Mrs. Dalloway'' it is one day in the life of the central character Clarissa Dalloway. In Cunningham's book it is one day in the life of each of the three central characters; Clarissa Vaughan, Laura Brown and Virginia Woolf herself. Through this prism, Cunningham attempts, as did Woolf, to show the beauty and profundity of every day&mdash;even the most ordinary&mdash;in every person's life and conversely how a person's whole life can be examined through the prism of one single day.  [[Michael Cunningham]] took the novel's title, ''The Hours'', from the original working title that Virginia Woolf used for ''Mrs. Dalloway''.  
Herland (novel)
 The story is told from the perspective of Vandyck "Van" Jennings, a [[sociology]] student who, along with two friends, Terry O. Nicholson and Jeff Margrave, forms an expedition party to explore an area of uncharted land rumored to be home to a society consisting entirely of women. The three friends do not entirely believe the rumors because they are unable to think of a way how human reproduction could occur without males. The men speculate about what a society of women would be like, each guessing differently based on the stereotype of women which he holds most dear: Jeff regarding women as things to be served and protected; Terry viewing them as things to be conquered and won.<ref>Clute and Nicholls 1995, p. 496.</ref>  When the explorers reach their destination, they proceed with caution, hiding the [[biplane]] they arrive in, and trying to keep themselves hidden in the forests that border the land. They are quickly found by three young women who they realize are observing them from the treetops. After attempting to catch the girls with trickery, the men end up chasing the young women towards a town or village. The women outrun them easily and disappear among the houses, which, Van notes are exceptionally well made and attractive. After meeting the first inhabitants of this new land (which Van names Herland) the men proceed more cautiously, noting that the girls they met were strong, agile, and completely unafraid. Their caution is warranted because as the men enter the town where the girls disappeared, they become surrounded by a large group of women who march them towards an official looking building. The three men attempt an escape but are swiftly and easily overpowered by the large group of women and eventually anesthetized.  The men awake to find themselves held captive in a fortress-like building. They are given comfortable living accommodations, clean clothes, and food. The women assign each man a tutor who teaches the men their language. Van makes many notes about the new country and people, commenting that everything from their clothing to their furniture seems to be made with the twin ideals of [[pragmatism]] and [[aesthetics]] given equal consideration. The women themselves appear intelligent and astute, unafraid and patient, with a notable lack of temper and seemingly limitless understanding for their captives. The women are keen to learn about the world outside and question the men eagerly about all manner of things. Often Van finds himself having difficulty justifying the practices of his own society such as the milking of cows, and the keeping of property, when faced with the apparent utopia the women have managed to build.  After being held captive for a number of months, the men break out of the fortress and escape cross-country to where they left their biplane. Finding the biplane sewn inside a large fabric covering, the men are unable to get away and are resignedly recaptured by the women. They are treated well nonetheless and soon learn that they will be given a freer rein when they have mastered the women's language and proved they can be trusted. Van remarks upon Terry's personal difficulty in dealing with the women who steadfastly refuse to conform to his expectations of how women should act, though Jeff seems perfectly enamored of the women and their kindness.  Van gradually finds out more information about the women's society, discovering that most of the men were killed 2,000 years ago when a volcanic eruption sealed off the only pass out of Herland. The remaining men were mostly slaves who killed the sons of their dead masters and the old women, intending to take over the land and the young women with it. The women fought back, however, killing the slaves. After a period of hopelessness at the impending end of their race, cut off from the rest of the world and without any men, one woman among the survivors became pregnant and bore a female child, and five more female children after. The five daughters of this woman also grew up to bear five daughters each. This process rapidly expanded their population and led to the exaltation of motherhood. Ever since that time the women had devoted themselves to improving their minds, working together and raising their children; the position of teacher being one of the most revered and respected positions in the land.  As the men are allowed more freedom, each strikes up a relationship with one of the women they had first seen upon their arrival: Van with Ellador, Jeff with Celis, and Terry with Alima. Having had no men for 2,000 years, the women apparently have no experience or cultural memory of romantic love or sexual intercourse. Accordingly, the couples' budding relationships progress with some difficulty and much explanation. Terry in particular finds it hard to adjust to being in a relationship with a woman who is not a 'woman' in his terms. Eventually all three couples get 'married', although the women largely fail to see the point of such a thing, and as they have no particular religion the ceremony is more [[Paganism|pagan]] than Christian.  Their marriages cause the men much reflection; the women they married have no conception of what being a wife or being feminine entails. Van finds it frustrating sometimes, though in the end he is grateful for his wonderful friendship with Ellador and the intense love he feels for her. Terry is not so wise, and out of frustration attempts to [[Marital rape|rape]] Alima. After being forcefully restrained and once again anesthetized, Terry stands trial before the women and is ordered to return to his homeland. The other men, while disapproving of Terry's actions, see them as merely impolite rather than criminal. Van explains to Ellador, "[Crime]'s a pretty hard word for it. After all, Alima was his wife, you know."  Van realizes that he must accompany Terry home in the biplane and Ellador will not let him leave without her. In the end, both Terry and Van leave Herland with promises not to reveal the utopia until Ellador has returned and such a plan has been fully discussed. Jeff chooses to stay behind and live in Herland with his now pregnant wife, Celis. Van tries to prepare Ellador for returning to his world but feels much trepidation about what she will find there.  
The Golden Notebook
 ''The Golden Notebook'' is the story of writer Anna Wulf, the four notebooks in which she records her life, and her attempt to tie them together in a fifth, gold-coloured notebook. The book intersperses segments of an ostensibly realistic narrative of the lives of Anna and her friend, Molly Jacobs, as well as their children, ex-husbands and lovers—entitled ''Free Women''—with excerpts from Anna's four notebooks, coloured black (of Anna's experience in [[Southern Rhodesia]], before and during World War II, which inspired her own best-selling novel), red (of her experience as a member of the Communist Party), yellow (an ongoing novel that is being written based on the painful ending of Anna's own love affair), and blue (Anna's personal journal where she records her memories, dreams, and emotional life). Each notebook is returned to four times, interspersed with episodes from ''Free Women'', creating non-chronological, overlapping sections that interact with one another. This post-modern styling, with its space for "play" engaging the characters and readers, is among the most famous features of the book, although Lessing insisted that readers and reviewers pay attention to the serious themes in the novel.  
Gemma Doyle Trilogy
 This series is a cross between period fiction and Fantasy.  The story revolves around Gemma Doyle, a young woman sent from her home in British [[India]] to the boarding school, Spence Academy, after the mysterious death of her mother. There she meets Ann, Felicity, and Pippa, three other remarkable young women. Together, they discover the dark past of their school, which closely revolves around a mystical group referred to as The Order. In the first book, they find out that this group of sorceresses was forced to disband after one of their own, a woman named Sarah Rees-Toome, betrayed them.  Throughout the series Gemma learns of her own heritage and the magical powers she possesses, including the ability to enter "The Realms," a magical world in which dreams can become reality, but everything seems to have a cost.  This series addresses some of the issues faced by women in the late 1800s, and creates parallels to issues faced by women today.  There are many female characters, and the struggles they encounter on their journey to becoming empowered both within and outside of The Realms ring true.  Other themes include dissecting dualities (in particular, the duality between good and evil;) free will versus fate; going against social norms; power; and, most of all, the concept of choice.  The three books in the trilogy span just one year, with ''A Great and Terrible Beauty'' beginning in June 1895 and ''The Sweet Far Thing'' ending in June 1896.  
Les Guérillères
 '''''Les Guérillères''''' is about a war of the sexes, where women 'engage in bloody, victorious battles using knives, machine guns and rocket launchers'.<ref name="Monique Wittig, 67, Feminist Writer, Dies"/> Moreover, sympathetic males join them in their combat.<ref>Crowder, Diane Griffin, 'From the Straight Mind to Queer Theory; Implications for Political Movement', ''Monique Wittig: At the Crossroads of Criticism'', [[GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies]], special issue, Duke University Press, 2007, page 493</ref>  
Fantomina
 The story opens in a [[Theatre (building)|playhouse]] in [[London]] where the unnamed main character, intrigued by the men at the theater and the attention they pay to the prostitutes there, decides to pretend being a prostitute herself. Disguised, she especially enjoys talking with Beauplaisir, whom she has encountered before, though previously constrained by her social status's formalities. He, not recognizing her, and believing her favors to be for sale, asks to meet her. She demurs and puts him off until the next evening.  In preparation, she rents lodgings and then meets him at the theater the following night. They go to the house and have dinner. Meanwhile the protagonist realizes that Beauplaisir wants to have sex and she tries to resist him by telling him she is a virgin. However, he is too aroused and does not listen to her protests, and he rapes her.  Afterwards, she is despondent and rejects his money, which confuses Beauplaisir, who did not believe her protestations being serious. Worried about her reputation, she gives her name as "Fantomina".  Soon, however, Beauplaisir tires of her and leaves for [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. Though she continues to employ the ruse of "Fantomina" throughout the story, the protagonist drops this alias for a short time to pursue Beauplaisir to Bath. Dressed as a country maid, she obtains employment at the inn where he is staying, taking the name Celia. When Beauplaisir sees her, he believes her to be a new maid, and makes romantic overtures. The protagonist plots this encounter carefully and Beauplaisir's every reaction is drawn from him by her manipulation, but the lover believes he has ravished her in spite of some protest on her part. He gives her some money in recompense.  He leaves Bath after about a month, tired of Celia. On his way home, he encounters Mrs. Bloomer, who is the protagonist dressed as a widow, and invites her into his carriage. Her grief prompts him to try to raise her spirits, which results in them having sex in an inn along the way.  When this identity again begins to lose favor with him, the heroine sends Beauplaisir a letter, signed "Incognita," declaring her undying love and passion for him. She writes there is nothing she will refuse him, except the sight of her face. They meet and she, wearing a mask, agrees to sleep with him in the dark. Beauplaisir keeps up each of these affairs, never realizing they are the same woman. The protagonist becomes pregnant and after she gives birth her mother insists she name the father. When Beauplaisir arrives, he does not know who she is until she tells her story in full. At the end, her mother sends her to live in a [[monastery]] in France.  
The Joy Luck Club (novel)
 [[File:First Chinese Baptist Church, SF corner.JPG|thumb|right|upright|First Chinese Baptist Church at 15 Waverly Pl, San Francisco]] The Joy Luck Club consists of sixteen interlocking stories about the lives of four Chinese immigrant mothers and their four American-born daughters.<ref> </ref> In 1949, the four mothers meet at the First Chinese Baptist Church in San Francisco and agree to continue to meet to play mah jong. They call their mah jong group the Joy Luck Club. The stories told in this novel revolve around the Joy Luck Club women and their daughters.  Structurally, the novel is divided into four major sections, with two sections focusing on the stories of the mothers and two sections on the stories of the daughters.  ===Feathers from a Thousand Li Away=== The first section, ''Feathers from a Thousand [[Li (unit)|Li]] Away'', introduces the Joy Luck Club through daughter Jing-Mei Woo, whose late mother Suyuan Woo founded the Joy Luck Club, and focuses on the four mothers. Jing-Mei relates the story of how her mother Suyuan was the wife of an officer in the [[Kuomintang]] during World War II and how she was forced to flee from her home in [[Guilin|Kweilin]] and abandon her twin daughters. Suyuan later found out her first husband died, remarried to Canning Woo, and immigrated to the United States where Jing-Mei was born. Suyuan and Canning attempted to find Suyuan's daughters, and Canning assumed that Suyuan had given up hope. Jing-Mei, who has been asked to take her mother's place in the Joy Luck Club, learns from the other mothers that her half-sisters are alive. They ask that Jing-Mei go to China and meet her sisters, and tell them about Suyuan's death.  The other three mothers relate the stories of their childhood. An-Mei Hsu's story relates how her mother left her family to become the fourth concubine of Wu Tsing, a rich merchant, while An-Mei was raised by her maternal grandmother.  Her mother returns only to cut off a piece of her flesh to cook a soup in hopes of healing An-Mei's grandmother, though An-Mei's grandmother still dies. Lindo Jong explains how in childhood she was forced into a loveless marriage and was pressured by her mother-in-law's desire for Lindo to produce grandchildren.  Through her own ingenuity, Lindo fabricates a convincing story to annul her marriage and immigrate to the United States. The final story of the first section follows Ying-Ying St. Clair, who tells the story of how she fell into a lake during the [[Zhongqiujie]] festival when she was only four.  After being rescued by a group of fishermen, she realizes that she is lost. This experience emotionally traumatizes her, and she is dropped at the shore, and wanders into an  [[Chinese Opera|outdoor performance]] featuring [[Chang'e|the Moon Lady]], said to grant wishes. But when Ying-Ying approaches the Moon Lady after the play to wish to be returned to her family, she discovers the Moon Lady is played by a man.  ===Twenty-Six Malignant Gates=== The second section traces the childhoods of the Joy Luck children. In the first story, Waverly Jong talks about how she started playing chess, first with her brothers and then with old men in the playground near her school. At the age of nine, she becomes a national chess champion. She is embarrassed when her mother, Lindo introduces her to everyone she meets, showing her off like a trophy and seeming to take the credit for her daughter's brilliance. This leads to an angry confrontation between the two of them.  Lena relates the stories her mother told her when she was younger (her great grandfather sentenced a beggar to die in the worst possible manner). Lena’s family moves to North Hill from Oakland. Her mother, who seems restless, delivers an anencephalic child who dies at birth. In Lena’s eyes, her mother becomes a ‘living ghost’. The story of their neighbors and the relationship between the mother and the daughter of the neighboring household is also mentioned. Rose Hsu Jordan wishes to tell her mother that she plans to divorce her husband Ted. She reflects on their relationship. She then goes on to relate an incident in which her family (her parents and six siblings) go to the beach. Her youngest brother, Bing, drowns. She returns along with her mother An Mei to search for Bing, but in vain. The last story is that of Jing Mei Woo and the pressure that her mother puts on her to perform exceedingly well in some field (to be a child prodigy). She begins to learn to play the piano but doesn't perform well in a concert and stops playing. This disappoints her mother because she wanted her to be a great pianist and Jing-Mei shows no interest in being anything else but herself. Around her 30th birthday, Suyuan presents her an old piano which she used to play as a child. Although Jing-Mei admits she had forgotten how to play the piano, Suyuan encourages her to try again. She admits to Jing-Mei that she still has the talent to be a great pianist, but self-doubt holds her back.  ===American Translation===  The third section follows the Joy Luck children as adult women, all facing various conflicts. In Lena's story, she narrates her troubling marital problems and how she fears being inferior to her husband, but does not realize he has taken advantage of her both at home and at work, where he is also her boss and earns much more than her. Ying-Ying is very much aware of this and encourages Lena to stop being passive and stand up to her husband or nothing will change. Waverly Jong worries about her mother's opinion of her white fiance, Rich, and recalls quitting chess after becoming angry at her mother in the marketplace (believing that her mother still has absolute power over her and will object to her forthcoming marriage to Rich). After a disastrous attempt at a dinner party to tell her mother of their wedding, Waverly confronts her mother the morning afterwards and realizes that her mother has known all along about her relationship with Rich and has accepted him. Rose Hsu Jordan learns that Ted intends to marry someone else after divorcing her, she realizes through her mother's advice that she needs to fight for her rights and refuses to sign the conditions set forth by his divorce papers. She hires a good lawyer and wins possession of the house, forcing Ted to take her more seriously. In Jing-Mei's story, Jing-Mei has an argument with Waverly at a Chinese New Year's dinner the year before the story begins. Realizing that Jing-Mei has been humiliated, Suyuan gives her a special jade pendant called "life's importance," which Jing-Mei rues that she never learned the meaning of the pendant's name. She also confronts Suyuan with the belief that she had always been disappointed in Jing-Mei and admitted she could never live up to her high expectations. Jing-Mei believes that because she has never finished college, doesn't have a good career and remains unmarried are reasons that she is seen as a failure in her mother's eyes. Suyuan eventually reveals her true meaning; that while Waverly has style, she lacks the kind and generous heart that Jing-Mei has. She also tells Jing-Mei that she understands the frustrations of never being good enough in her eyes and admits she is proud of Jing-Mei.  ===[[Xi Wangmu|Queen Mother of the Western Skies]]=== The final section of the novel returns to the viewpoints of the mothers as adults dealing with difficult choices. An-Mei reveals what happened after her grandmother died; she accompanied her mother back to where she lived as the abused fourth concubine of Wu Tsing, whose second concubine manipulates and controls the household and has taken An-Mei's half-brother as her son. An-Mei learns how her mother was forced into accepting her position after Wu Tsing's second wife arranged for An-Mei's mother to be raped and shamed. When she came to her family for help, they cruelly turned their backs on her mother and telling her to leave. An-Mei finds her mother has poisoned herself two days before Chinese New Year, knowing that Wu Tsing's superstitious beliefs will ensure An-Mei will grow in favorable conditions. During the funeral, she takes her younger half-brother and forces Wu Tsing to honor both them and their deceased mother out of fear of him being haunted by the mother's ghost. When the Second Wife attempts to discredit her, An-Mei quickly makes an example of her by destroying the fake pearl necklace that she originally gave to her, which exposes her cruelty and manipulation. This causes the Second Wife to realize that she has lost control of the household and brought trouble on herself that she backs down. Fearing bad karma on the way, Wu Tsing honors both An-Mei and her brother as his children and their mother as his favorite 1st wife. Ying-Ying St. Clair reveals how her first husband, a womanizer, abandoned her and how she married an American man she did not love after relinquishing her sense of control in her life. She later took back her sense of control when she finally had a talk to Lena and convinced her to leave Harold. Lindo Jong relates how she arrived in San Francisco and met An-Mei Hsu when they both worked at a fortune-cookie factory, which eventually gave her the means to plant the idea of marriage in her boyfriend's head.  The novel's final episode returns to Jing-Mei and her mother's desire to find her lost twin daughters. Jing-Mei and her father fly to China, where Jing-Mei meets her half-sisters and embraces her Chinese heritage. In doing so, she was finally able to make peace with Suyuan.  
The House of the Spirits
 The story starts with the del Valle family, focusing upon the youngest and the oldest daughters of the family, Clara and Rosa. The youngest daughter, Clara del Valle, has [[paranormal]] powers and keeps a detailed diary of her life. Using her powers, Clara predicts an accidental death in the family. Shortly after this, Clara's sister, Rosa the Beautiful, is killed by poison intended for her father who is running for the [[Senate of Chile|Senate]]. Rosa's fiancé, a poor miner named Esteban Trueba, is devastated and attempts to mend his broken heart by devoting his life to restoring  his family [[hacienda]], Las Tres Marías, which has fallen into poverty and disrepair. He sends money to his spinster sister who takes care of his arthritic mother in town. Through a combination of intimidation and reward he quickly earns/forces respect and labor from the fearful peasants and turns Tres Marías into a "model hacienda". He turns the first peasant who spoke to him upon arrival, Pedro Segundo, into his foreman, who quickly becomes the closest thing that Trueba ever has to an actual friend during his life. He rapes many of the peasant women, and his first victim, Pancha García, becomes the mother of his bastard son, Esteban García.  Esteban returns to the city to see his dying mother. After her death, Esteban decides to fulfill her dying wish: for him to marry and have legitimate children. He goes to the Del Valle family to ask for Clara's hand in marriage. Clara accepts Esteban's proposal; she herself has predicted her engagement two months prior, speaking for the first time in nine years. During the period of their engagement, Esteban builds what everyone calls "the big house on the corner," a large mansion in the city where the Trueba family will live for generations. After their wedding, Esteban's sister Férula comes to live with the newlyweds in the big house on the corner. Férula develops a strong dedication to Clara, which fulfills her need to serve others. However, Esteban's wild desire to possess Clara and to monopolize her love causes him to throw Férula out of the house. She curses him, telling him that he will shrink in body and soul, and die like a dog. Although she misses her sister-in-law,  Clara is unable to find her sister-in-law by any means and the gap between her and her husband widens as she devotes her time to her daughter and the mystic arts.   Clara gives birth to a daughter named Blanca and later, to twin boys Jaime and Nicolás. The family, which resides in the capital, stays at the hacienda during the summertime. Upon arriving at Tres Marías for the first time, Blanca immediately befriends a young boy named Pedro Tercero, who is the son of her father's foreman. Blanca and Pedro grow up together as best friends despite them being of two different social and economic classes. During their teenage years, Blanca and Pedro Tercero eventually become lovers. After an earthquake that destroys part of the hacienda and leaves Esteban injured, the Truebas move permanently to Las Tres Marías. Clara spends her time teaching, caring for her husbands battered body, and writing in her journals while Blanca is sent to a convent school and the twin boys back to an English boarding school, both of which are located in the city. Blanca fakes an illness so as to be sent back to Las Tres Marías, where she can be with Pedro Tercero, but when she arrives home  she finds that Pedro Tercero has been banished from the hacienda by Esteban, on account of his revolutionary communist/socialist ideas. Pedro Tercero meets with Blanca in secret adopting disguises while also spreading his ideas in the form of song to neighboring haciendas.   A visiting [[French people|French]] [[count]] to the hacienda, Jean de Satigny, reveals Blanca's nightly romps with Pedro Tercero to her father. Esteban furiously goes after his daughter and brutally whips her. When Clara expresses horror at his actions, Esteban slaps her, knocking out her front teeth. Clara decides to never speak to him again, reclaims her maiden name and moves out of Tres Marías and back to the city, taking Blanca with her. Esteban, furious and lonely, blames Pedro Tercero for the whole matter; putting a price on the boy's head with the local corrupt police. At this point, Pedro Segundo deserts Esteban, telling him he does not want to be around when Trueba inevitably catches his son. Enraged by Pedro Segundo's departure, Trueba begins hunting for Pedro Tercero himself, eventually tracking him down to a small shack near his hacienda. He only succeeds in cutting off three of Pedro's fingers, and is filled with regret for his uncontrollable furies.  Blanca finds out she is pregnant with Pedro Tercero's child. Esteban, desperate to save the family honor, gets Blanca to marry the French count by telling her that he has killed Pedro Tercero. At first, Blanca gets along with her new husband, but she leaves him when she discovers his participation in sexual fantasies with the servants. Blanca quietly returns to the Trueba household and names her daughter Alba. Clara predicts that Alba will have a very happy future and good luck. Her future lover, Miguel, happens to watch her birth, as he had been living in the Trueba House with his sister, Amanda. They move out shortly after Alba's birth.  Esteban Trueba eventually moves to the Trueba house in the capital as well, although he continues to spend periods of time in Tres Marías. He becomes isolated from every member of his family except for little Alba, whom he is very fond of. Esteban runs as a senator for the Conservative Party but is nervous about whether or not he will win. Clara speaks to him, through signs, informing him that "those who have always won will win again" – this becomes his motto. Clara then begins to speak to Esteban through signs, although she keeps her promise and never actually speaks to him again. A few years later, Clara dies peacefully and Esteban is overwhelmed with grief.  Alba is a solitary child who enjoys playing make-believe in the basement of the house and painting the walls of her room. Blanca has become very poor since leaving Jean de Satigny's house, getting a small income out of selling pottery and giving pottery classes to mentally handicapped children, and is once again dating Pedro Tercero, now a revolutionary singer/songwriter. Alba and Pedro are fond of each other, but do not know they are father and daughter, although Pedro suspects this. Alba is also fond of her uncles. Nicolás is eventually kicked out by his father, moving, supposedly, to North America.  When she is older, Alba attends a local college where she meets Miguel, now a grown man, and becomes his lover. Miguel is a revolutionary, and out of love for him, Alba involves herself in student protests against the [[Conservatism|conservative]] government. After the victory of the People's Party (a socialist movement), Alba celebrates with Miguel.  Fearing a [[Communism|Communist]] [[dictatorship]], Esteban Trueba and his fellow politicians plan a military [[Coup d'état|coup]] of the socialist government. However, when the military coup is set into action, the military men relish their power and grow out of control. Esteban's son Jaime is killed by power-driven soldiers along with other supporters of the government. After the coup, people are regularly kidnapped and tortured. Esteban helps Blanca and Pedro Tercero flee to [[Canada]], where the couple finally find their happiness.  The military regime attempts to eliminate all traces of opposition and eventually comes for Alba. She is made the prisoner of Colonel Esteban García, the son of Esteban Trueba's and Pancha Garcia's illegitimate son, and hence the grandson of Esteban Trueba. During an earlier visit to the Trueba house, García had molested Alba as a child. In pure hatred of her privileged life and eventual inheritance, García tortures Alba repeatedly, looking for information on Miguel. He rapes her, thus completing the cycle that Esteban Trueba put into motion when he raped Pancha García. When Alba loses her will to live, she is visited by Clara's spirit who tells her not to wish for death, since it can easily come, but to wish to live.  Esteban Trueba manages to free Alba with the help of Miguel and Tránsito Soto, an old friend/prostitute from his days as a young man. After helping Alba write their memoir, Esteban Trueba dies in the arms of Alba, accompanied by Clara's spirit; he is smiling, having avoided Férula's prophecy that he will die like a dog. Alba explains that she will not seek vengeance on those who have injured her, suggesting a hope that one day the human cycle of hate and revenge can be broken. Alba writes the book to pass time while she waits for Miguel and for the birth of her child.  
A Long Fatal Love Chase
 Alcott patiently drudged away at ''Little Women''<ref>Wells, Kim. "Louisa May Alcott and the roles of a lifetime." Master's Thesis, Southwest Texas State University, May 1998 [http://www.womenwriters.net/domesticgoddess/thesis.htm (full text)]</ref> but found emotional release in scribbling her blood-and-thunder tales.<ref>Eiselein, Gregory. ibid.</ref>  The difference shows: in pacing, tone, and content, ''Love Chase'' is startlingly unlike its famous successor. The ostentatiously [[Faust]]ian plot centers on Rosamond Vivian, a discontented maiden who lives on an English island with only her bitter old grandfather for company and who begins the novel by rashly declaring: ''"I often feel as if I'd gladly sell my soul to Satan for a year of freedom."'' Right on cue, a man named Phillip Tempest — a man who bears a more than trivial resemblance to [[Mephistopheles]] — walks in the door. Within a month, Rosamond is in love, and although she realizes that this man is “no saint”, she marries him, believing with the fatuousness of youth that her love will save him. She sails away from her lonely island in Tempest's yacht, the ''[[Circe]]'', and begins her married life at a luxurious villa in Nice.  Much to his own surprise, Tempest, a heartless [[libertine]], finds that he, too, has fallen in love. He tries to make Rosamond happy, and succeeds for a while; however, after a year in his company, she begins to realize how conscienceless and cruel he is.  She then  discovers that Tempest has a wife and son already, making their marriage a sham and Rosamond the unwitting mistress of a man who has grossly deceived her.  That same night, she packs a few items, stealthily climbs down from her second-floor balcony, and catches the next train to Paris.  Tempest pursues her, beginning the obsessive “chase” of the title.  Tempest hunts Rosamond for two years, telling her he enjoys the sport. To throw him off the track, she assumes a variety of disguises: in Paris, she's a seamstress named “Ruth”; next, she escapes to a convent, where she's known as “Sister Agatha”; after that, under the name “Rosalie Varian”, she travels to Germany as companion to a wealthy little girl. Each time, as she begins to settle comfortably into a new life, Tempest makes  a sudden, [[funhouse]]-type entrance and ruins everything. Under this treatment, Rosamond learns to hate and fear her former lover. At the same time, a hopeless passion develops between Rosamond and Father Ignatius, a handsome, virtuous, high-born man who happens — unfortunately — to be a [[Roman Catholic]] priest.  The chase finally ends one night when Ignatius tries to help Rosamond return to her grandfather's island.  
Laura (novel)
 Like [[Wilkie Collins]]' detective novel ''[[The Moonstone]]'' (1868), ''Laura'' is narrated in the first person by several alternating characters.<ref>Hamache, ibid.</ref>  These individual stories all revolve around the apparent murder of the title character, a successful New York advertiser killed in the doorway of her apartment with a shotgun blast that obliterated her face.  Detective Mark McPherson, assigned to the case, begins investigating the two men who were closest to Laura: her former lover, a narcissistic middle-aged writer named Waldo Lydecker, and her fiance, the philandering Shelby Carpenter. As he learns more about Laura, Mark &ndash; not the most sentimental of men &ndash; begins to fall in love with her memory. When Laura turns out to be very much alive, however, she becomes the prime suspect.  The novel has some autobiographical elements; Caspary, like Laura, was an independent woman who earned her living as an advertiser and who struggled to balance career and romance.<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/person/84406/Vera-Caspary/biography Biography of Caspary] from the ''New York Times All-Movie Guide''</ref>

 In a remote [[Mennonite]] colony in the Mexican state of [[Chihuahua State|Chihuahua]], nineteen-year-old Irma Voth has been banished to a neighbouring farm by her strict, religious father after secretly marrying a non-Mennonite Mexican. After her new husband soon disappears into the drug trade, Irma tends to the farm alone. Her world is transformed when a bohemian film crew from [[Mexico City]] arrives to make a film about Mennonites. Irma, who speaks [[Plautdietsch]] (Low German), Spanish and English, is hired by Diego, the film's director, to act as interpreter and to cook for the crew.  As Irma is drawn into the exotic world of the hip, urban filmmakers, she begins to better understand her place in the world, and to envision the possibility of some form of self-determination. She wonders, “How do I behave in this world without following the directions of my father, my husband, or God?” Her thirteen-year-old sister, Aggie, is also emboldened by the presence of the outsiders, and like Irma, comes into dangerous conflict with the local community and her father, who believes that "Art is a lie." When their father's violence escalates, and the secret tragedy that has haunted her family begins to surface, Irma flees with Aggie and her infant sister, Ximena, to [[Chihuahua City]] and [[Acapulco]]. They eventually go to [[Mexico City]], where the Voth sisters must embrace the ways of the city in order to survive.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>  
Rose Madder (novel)
  In the prologue, which takes place in 1985, Rose Daniels' husband, Norman, beats her while she is four months pregnant, causing her to suffer a [[miscarriage]]. Rose briefly considers leaving Norman but dismisses the idea: Norman is a policeman, and is excellent at finding people. Norman also has a violent temper and was recently accused of assaulting a black woman named Wendy Yarrow.  The subsequent lawsuit and [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] investigation has made him even more volatile.  Nine years later, when Rose is making the bed, she notices a drop of blood on the sheet that dripped from her nose the night before; Norman had punched her in the face for spilling iced tea on him. Rose realizes that she has passively suffered through Norman's abuse for 14 years and that if she continues to put up with it, he may well eventually kill her. Rose decides to leave Norman, departing from her unidentified city on a bus, with their bank card. Once Norman realizes that Rose is gone, he resolves to hunt her down and kill her.  Rose arrives in a Midwestern city, disoriented and afraid. When she arrives at the bus station, she meets a man named Peter Slowik, who guides her to a [[women's shelter]] called Daughters and Sisters. There, she quickly makes several friends and, with the help of the shelter's director, Anna Stevenson, gets an apartment and a job as a hotel housekeeper, with her new friend Pam.  Rose decides to pawn her engagement ring, only to learn that it is [[cubic zirconia]]. However, she notices a painting of a woman in a [[rose madder]] gown and immediately falls in love with it. She trades her ring for the painting, which has no signature. Outside, a patron of the pawnshop, who witnessed Rose's ordeal with her wedding ring, asks her to read a passage from a novel. He is so impressed that he offers her a job recording [[audiobook]]s. Bill Steiner, the owner of the pawnshop, asks her for a date. Rose falls in love with him, but she is afraid to begin a new relationship.  Rose discovers that the painting seems to change from time to time. Eventually she is able to travel through it. On the other side, she encounters a woman called Dorcas, who resembles Wendy Yarrow. She also sees the woman in the rose-madder gown, whom she calls "Rose Madder" because of her gown and her evident madness. Rose Madder asks Rose to rescue her baby from an underground labyrinth inhabited by a blind, one-eyed bull called [[Erinyes]] who orients by his sense of smell.  Dorcas, or "Wendy", leads Rose to the edge of the temple grounds. She warns Rose of several dangers and trials that await her on her mission. Dorcas cannot enter the labyrinth, as she is afflicted by the same mysterious illness as her mistress, and Erinyes would be able to smell her. Before Rose parts from Dorcas, she is made to strip naked. Dorcas instructs Rose to rip her nightgown into several strips.  One is soaked in Dorcas' blood and tied around a rock.  Rose then wraps the bloodied rock in the remainder of her nightgown so its scent cannot escape.  Rose then continues into the temple, cold and alone.  She continues to argue with herself, trying to decide if she is dreaming or if everything is really happening.  There seems to be just too much detail for it to be a dream, but Rose still cannot seem to decide for certain.  Rose manages to save the child and escape Erinyes and returns the baby girl (whom Rose has temporarily named "Caroline", since that was the name she had chosen for the infant Norman caused her to miscarry) to Rose Madder, who promises to repay her. Rose returns to her world and puts the strange incident at the back of her mind.  Norman, who has arrived in what is suggested to be [[Chicago]], attacks some of Rose's friends from Daughters and Sisters, murders Anna and Pam, and then goes to confront Rose at her apartment. Norman kills the policemen assigned to protect Rose, then poses as one of them in the patrol car, and is able to see Rose and Bill returning from the police station. He attacks them both, almost strangling Bill to death, but Rose is able to fight him off because she believes she is wearing the golden arm circlet Rose Madder had given her. After inflicting an enormous amount of damage on Norman, she carries Bill to the apartment, where Rose sees the circlet on her table and realizes she's been fighting Norman the whole time. She then tricks Norman into following her and Bill into the painting, where Rose leads Norman, who has turned into Erinyes the bull, to Rose Madder, who kills him. Rose returns to her world with the instructions from Rose Madder to "remember the tree", where she leads a normal life with no further summons from Rose Madder. She marries Bill and has a daughter, but finds that the violent rages that characterized both Norman and Rose Madder have begun to spring up within her. She then remembers that Rose Madder, perhaps foreseeing the problem, allowed her to take some dangerous seeds home with her, and Rose plants the last remaining seed, along with Norman's police ring, in a secret grove by her favorite lake and finds the seed grows into a beautiful but deadly tree. She revisits that tree periodically as it grows, and is able to release her rage and go on with her life.

The Price of Salt
 Therese Belivet is a lonely young woman, just beginning her adult life in [[Manhattan]] and looking for her chance to launch her career as a theatre [[set design]]er. When she was a small girl, her widowed mother sent her to an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] [[boarding school]], leaving her with a sense of abandonment. Therese is dating Richard, a young man she does not love and does not enjoy having sex with. On a long and monotonous day, working in the toy department of the department store, Therese becomes interested in a customer, an elegant and beautiful woman in her early thirties. The woman, Carol Aird, gives Therese her address to have her purchases delivered. On an impulse, Therese sends Carol a Christmas card. Carol, who is going through a difficult separation and divorce and is herself quite lonely, unexpectedly responds. The two begin to spend time together. Therese develops a strong attachment to Carol. Richard accuses Therese of having a "schoolgirl crush", but Therese knows it is more than that: She is in love with Carol.  Carol's husband, Harge, is suspicious of Carol's relationship with Therese, whom he meets briefly when Therese stays over at Carol's house in [[New Jersey]]. Carol had previously admitted to Harge that she had a short-lived sexual relationship years earlier with her best friend, Abby. Harge takes his and Carol's daughter Rindy to live with him, limiting Carol's access to her as divorce proceedings continue. To escape from the tension in New York, Carol and Therese take a road trip [[Western United States|West]] as far as [[Utah]], over the course of which it becomes clear that the feelings they have for each other are romantic and sexual. They become physically as well as emotionally intimate and declare their love for each other.  The women become aware that a [[private investigator]] is following them, hired by Harge to gather evidence that could be used against Carol by incriminating her as [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] in the upcoming [[Child custody|custody]] hearings. They realize the investigator has already [[Covert listening device|bugged]] the hotel room in which Carol and Therese first had sex. Carol confronts him and demands that he hand over any evidence against her. She pays him a high price for some tapes even though he warns her that he has already sent several tapes and other evidence to Harge in New York. Carol knows that she will lose custody of Rindy if she continues her relationship with Therese. She tells Therese that she cannot continue their relationship. Carol leaves Therese alone in the Midwest and returns to New York to fight for her daughter.  The evidence for Carol's homosexuality is so strong that she capitulates to Harge without having the details of her behavior aired in court. She submits to an agreement that gives him full custody of Rindy and leaves her with limited supervised visits.  Though heartbroken, Therese returns to New York to rebuild her life. Therese and Carol arrange to meet again. Therese, still hurt that Carol abandoned her in a hopeless attempt to maintain a relationship with Rindy, declines Carol's invitation to live with her. They part, each headed for a different evening engagement. Therese, after a brief flirtation with an English actress that leaves her ashamed, quickly reviews her relationships —"loneliness swept over her like a rushing wind"— and goes to find Carol, who greets her more eagerly than ever before.  
The Red Tent (Diamant novel)
 Dinah opens the story by recounting for readers the union of her mother [[Leah]] and father [[Jacob]], as well as the expansion of the family to include Leah's sister [[Rachel]], and the handmaids [[Zilpah]] and [[Bilhah]]. Leah is depicted as capable but testy, Rachel as something of a belle, but kind and creative, Zilpah as eccentric and spiritual, and Bilhah as the gentle and quiet one of the quartet.

According to the [[Bible]]'s account in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 34, Dinah was "defiled" by a prince of [[Shechem]], although he is described as being genuinely in love with Dinah. He also offers a [[bride price]] fit for royalty. Displeased at how the prince treated their sister, her brothers [[Simeon (son of Jacob)|Simeon]] (spelled "Simon" in the book) and [[Levi]] treacherously tell the Shechemites that all will be forgiven if the prince and his men undergo the Jewish rite of [[circumcision]] (''brit milah'') so as to unite the people of Hamor, king of Shechem, with the tribe of Jacob. The Shechemites agree, and shortly after they go under the knife, while incapacitated by pain, they are murdered by Dinah's brothers and their male servants, who then return with Dinah.  In ''The Red Tent'', Dinah genuinely loves the prince and willingly becomes his bride. She is horrified and grief-stricken by her brothers' murderous rampage.

Mary: A Fiction
 ''Mary'' begins with a description of the conventional and loveless marriage between the heroine's mother and father. Eliza, Mary's mother, is obsessed with novels, rarely considers anyone but herself, and favours Mary's brother. She neglects her daughter, who educates herself using only books and the natural world. Ignored by her family, Mary devotes much of her time to charity. When her brother suddenly dies, leaving Mary heir to the family's fortune, her mother finally takes an interest in her; she is taught "accomplishments", such as dancing, that will attract suitors. However, Mary's mother soon sickens and requests on her deathbed that Mary wed Charles, a wealthy man she has never met. Stunned and unable to refuse, Mary agrees. Immediately after the ceremony, Charles departs for [[Europe|the Continent]].  To escape a family who does not share her values, Mary befriends Ann, a local girl who educates her further. Mary becomes quite attached to Ann, who is in the grip of an unrequited love and does not reciprocate Mary's feelings. Ann's family falls into poverty and is on the brink of losing their home, but Mary is able to repay their debts after her marriage to Charles gives her limited control over her money.  Ann becomes [[tuberculosis|consumptive]] and Mary travels with her to Lisbon in hopes of nursing her back to health. There they are introduced to Henry, who is also trying to regain his health. Ann dies and Mary is grief-stricken. Henry and Mary fall in love but are forced to return to England separately. Mary, depressed by her marriage to Charles and bereft of both Ann and Henry, remains unsettled, until she hears that Henry's consumption has worsened. She rushes to his side and cares for him until he dies.  At the end of the novel, Charles returns from Europe; he and Mary establish something of a life together, but Mary is unhealthy and can barely stand to be in the same room with her husband; the last few lines of the novel imply that she will die young.  
Possessing the Secret of Joy
  It tells the story of Tashi, an African woman and a minor character in Walker's earlier novel ''[[The Color Purple]]''. Now in the US she comes from Olinka, Alice Walker's fictional [[Africa]]n nation where [[female genital mutilation]] is practiced. Tashi marries an American man named Adam then leaves Olinka because of the war. Tashi chooses to go back to Olinka to undergo circumcison because she is a woman torn between two cultures, Olinkan and Western. Instead of feeling free from not having the procedure done as a child, she feels bothered by it. She wants to honor her Olinkan roots and has the operation in her teen years, although it is usually performed on female children. Tashi later sees several psychiatrists because she goes crazy due to the trauma she has suffered before finding the strength to act. The novel is told in many different voices, which are the characters in the novel. The novel explores what it means to have one's gender culturally defined and emphasizes that, according to Walker, "Torture is not culture."  
The Queen's Gambit (novel)
 ''The Queen's Gambit'' traces chess prodigy Beth Harmon's life from her childhood in an orphanage through her struggles with tranquilizer and alcohol addiction to her triumphant rise through the [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] ranks.  Eight-year-old orphan Beth Harmon is quiet, sullen, and by all appearances unremarkable—until she plays her first game of chess. Her senses grow sharper, her thinking clearer, and for the first time in her life she feels herself fully in control. By the age of sixteen, she’s competing for the U.S. Open championship. But as she hones her skills on the professional circuit, the stakes get higher, her isolation grows more frightening, and the thought of escape becomes all the more tempting.  
Saman (novel)
 ''Saman'' follows four sexually liberated female friends: Yasmin, a married Catholic lawyer from [[Medan]]; Cok, a [[Balinese people|Balinese]] lawyer with a high libido; Shakuntala, a bisexual Catholic [[Javanese people|Javanese]] dancer; and Laila, a Muslim [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] journalist. The other protagonist is the titular Saman, a former [[Catholic priest]] turned human rights activist who becomes the target of sexual advances by Yasmin and Cok.  The first chapter, beginning in [[Central Park]], New York, describes Laila waiting for the married Sihar and planning to lose her virginity to him. Eventually Laila realises that Sihar is with his wife, and feels depressed.  The second chapter covers Saman's childhood—including his relationship with his mother, a woman drawn to the spiritual world—his entry into priesthood, and his attempt to protect a [[rubber tapping]] community from the attempt by a local plantation to acquire their land. After the attempt fails and the plantation's hired thugs raze the community to the ground and kills those who resist, Saman is captured and tortured. He eventually is broken out of his confinement by the surviving resistance members, becoming a fugitive and relinquishing his duty as a priest.  He becomes a human rights advocate, assisted by Yasmin.  The third chapter, written from the point of view of Shakuntala, tells  how Yasmin, Cok, Shakuntala, and Laila met at high school and their escapades there, both sexual and academic. Shakuntala recounts a fantasy she had as a teenager about meeting a "foreign demon", embracing him and then having a debate on the different cultural aspects of sexuality. Towards the end of the chapter, Shakuntala notes that she is attracted to Laila and dislikes Sihar, but supports her friend's efforts as she cares for her.  During the fourth chapter, Saman is spirited away to New York by Yasmin and Cok. Although both Cok and the married Yasmin make advances toward him, he initially declines. However, during the middle of the night he and Yasmin have sex, but Saman is distressed because he [[premature ejaculation|ejaculated quickly]]. The entirety of the last chapter consists of emails sent between Saman and Yasmin, discussing their insecurities,  that become increasingly sexualised.  
Regiment of Women
  Set in a small town in [[Edwardian era|Edwardian England]], ''Regiment of Women'' is about the relationship between two teachers at a private (and elitist) girls' school. One of them, Clare Hartill, is in her mid-thirties and runs the school in all but name, the ageing and sickly headmistress depending on her whenever a decision has to be taken concerning the school or any of its pupils. Most of the girls are devoted to Hartill and gladly suffer under her strict but charismatic rule and the loads of homework she sets them, mainly to prove to her and to themselves that they are more academically advanced than she told them they were. Hartill lives alone near the school in a small, old-fashioned flat full of books but without gas or electricity.  The other teacher is Alwynne Durand, an attractive nineteen-year-old woman without any formal training<ref>She "has not been to college." (''Regiment'', p.272). All following page references are to the Virago edition.</ref> who lives with Elsbeth Loveday, her unmarried aunt and [[legal guardian|guardian]]. When Durand starts teaching at the school she is immediately popular with her students but also excites Hartill's attention — not just because the young mistress is as enthusiastic about teaching as herself, but also because Hartill is always on the lookout for companionship.<ref>We learn that Hartill does not "encourage the re-entry of old friends into her life". A basic flaw in her nature compels her to suck each of her female companions dry, then drop her and look for a new one: "She could neither keep a friend nor live without one." (''Regiment'', p.126).</ref> The two women become close friends, and Durand spends more and more of her spare time in Hartill's flat, occasionally not returning to her aunt's for days. The couple also travel abroad together during the summer holidays. Although Loveday and Hartill hardly ever meet, a strange kind of antagonism develops between them, each woman fighting to spend more time than they do with Alwynne Durand and to be the dominant person in Alwynne's life.  In the course of the schoolyear one of Hartill's protégées, an unfortunate fourteen-year-old called Louise who has disappointed Hartill by failing an important exam, commits suicide by jumping from an upper floor window of the school building. The suicide is successfully hushed up, pronounced a case of accidental death, and quickly forgotten. What Hartill deliberately fails to mention, however, is that Louise's death, which happened on the night of the school play, was apparently triggered by her harsh criticism of Louise's excellent performance in the play. In the months that follow, Hartill even manages to shift the burden of guilt onto Durand's shoulders, persuading the young mistress that she ought to have detected any suicidal tendencies in Louise while giving her extra lessons.  Hartill's increasingly bizarre and offensive behaviour and her naive niece's growing dependence on her older friend call Elsbeth Loveday to action. When, on top of her shattered nerves, Alwynne Durand comes down with the flu, Loveday insists on her not returning to school for the rest of the term and on recuperating from her illness in the country instead. Alwynne agrees, if reluctantly at first, to spend some time with distant relatives she has never met before. The idyllic spring landscape she encounters after leaving town actually soothes her nerves, and Alwynne grows more and more fond of country life and the people she meets in her new surroundings.  But Elsbeth Loveday's scheme includes more than her niece's mere convalescence. As planned by her aunt, Alwynne Durand finds a confidant, and secret admirer, in thirty-year-old Roger Lumsden, a good-hearted, intelligent and handsome man who runs his own gardening business. Completely inexperienced with men except for what she has read in novels, Alwynne does not recognise her feelings for Lumsden as love, and she still looks forward to her reunion with Hartill. When she eventually returns to her home town, Lumsden follows her, proposes to her, and, naturally, is rejected. Only when Hartill, too sure of her seemingly inseparable bond with Alwynne, continues treating her badly does Alwynne wake up to reality. She sends Hartill a telegram telling her she has taken the train to the country in order to get married.  
The Tenant of Wildfell Hall
 The novel is divided into three volumes.  '''Part One (Chapters 1 to 15):''' Gilbert Markham narrates how a mysterious widow, Mrs Helen Graham, arrives at Wildfell Hall, a nearby mansion. A source of curiosity for the small community, the reticent Mrs Graham and her young son, Arthur, are slowly drawn into the social circles of the village. Initially Gilbert Markham casually courts Eliza Millward, despite his mother's belief that he can do better. His interest in Eliza wanes as he comes to know Mrs Graham. In retribution, Eliza spreads (and perhaps creates) scandalous rumours about Helen. With gossip flying, Gilbert is led to believe that his friend Mr Lawrence is courting Mrs Graham. At a chance meeting on a road Gilbert strikes the mounted Lawrence with a whip handle, causing him to fall from his horse. Though she is unaware of this confrontation, Helen Graham still refuses to marry Gilbert, but when he accuses her of loving Lawrence she gives him her diaries.  [[File:Colls' The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.jpg|thumb|upright|Helen and Gilbert by Walter L. Colls]]  '''Part two (Chapters 16 to 44)''' is taken from Helen's diaries, in which she describes her marriage to Arthur Huntingdon. The handsome, witty Huntingdon is also spoilt, selfish and self-indulgent. Before marrying Helen, he flirts with Annabella, and uses this to manipulate Helen and convince her to marry him. Helen, blinded by love, marries him, and resolves to reform him with gentle persuasion and good example. After the birth of their only child, however, Huntingdon becomes increasingly jealous of their son (also called Arthur), and his claims on Helen's attentions and affections.  Huntingdon's pack of dissolute friends frequently engage in drunken revels at the family's home, Grassdale, oppressing those of finer character. Both men and women are portrayed as degraded. In particular, Annabella, now Lady Lowborough, is shown to be unfaithful to her melancholy but devoted husband.  Walter Hargrave, the brother of Helen's friend Milicent Hargrave, vies for Helen's affections. While he is not as wild as his peers, he is an unwelcome admirer: Helen senses his predatory nature when they play chess. Walter informs Helen of Arthur's affair with Lady Lowborough. When his friends depart, Arthur pines openly for his paramour and derides his wife, but will not grant her a divorce.  Arthur's corruption of their son – encouraging him to drink and swear at his tender age – is the last straw for Helen. She plans to flee to save her son, but her husband learns of her plans from her diary and burns the artist's tools with which she had hoped to support herself. Eventually, with help from her brother, Mr Lawrence, Helen finds a secret refuge at Wildfell Hall.  '''Part Three (Chapters 45 to 53)''' begins after Gilbert's reading of the diaries. Helen bids Gilbert to leave her because she is not free to marry. He complies and soon learns that she has returned to Grassdale because her husband is gravely ill. Helen's ministrations are in vain, and Huntingdon's death is painful since he is fraught with terror at what awaits him. Helen cannot comfort him, for he rejects responsibility for his actions and wishes instead for her to come with him to plead for his salvation.  A year passes. Gilbert pursues a rumour of Helen's impending wedding, only to find that Mr Lawrence, with whom he has reconciled, is marrying Helen's friend Esther Hargrave. Gilbert goes to Grassdale, and discovers that Helen is now wealthy and lives at her estate in Staningley. He travels there, but is plagued by anxiety that she is now far above his station. By chance he encounters Helen, her aunt and young Arthur. The two lovers reconcile and marry.

Surfacing (novel)
 The book tells the story of a woman who returns to her hometown in Canada to find her missing father. Accompanied by her lover, Joe, and a married couple, Anna and David, the unnamed [[protagonist]] meets her past in her childhood house, recalling events and feelings, while trying to find clues to her father's mysterious disappearance. Little by little, the past overtakes her and drives her into the realm of wildness and madness.  
The Secret Life of Bees (novel)
  Set in the fictitious town of Sylvan, [[South Carolina]], in 1964, ''The  Secret Life of Bees'' tells the story of a 14-year-old white girl, Lily Melissa Owens, whose life has been shaped around the blurred memory of the afternoon her mother was killed. She lives in a house with her abusive father, whom she refers to as T. Ray. They have a no-nonsense maid, Rosaleen, who acts as a surrogate mother for Lily. The book opens with Lily's discovery of bees in her bedroom. Then, after Rosaleen is arrested for pouring her bottle of "snuff juice" on three white men, Lily breaks her out of the hospital and they decide to leave town. They begin hitch-hiking toward Tiburon, SC, a place written on the back of an image of the Virgin Mary as a black woman, which Deborah, her mother, had owned. They spend a night in the woods with little food and little hope before reaching Tiburon. There, they buy lunch at a general store, and Lily recognizes a picture of the same "[[Black Madonna|Black Mary]]" but on the side of a jar of honey. They receive directions to the origin of that honey, the Boatwright residence. They are introduced to the Boatwright sisters, the makers of the honey: August, May, and June, who are all black. Lily makes up a story about being an orphan. Lily and Rosaleen are invited to stay with the sisters.  They learn the ways of the Boatwrights, as well as the ways of bee keeping. With a new home and a new family for the time being, Lily learns more about the Black Madonna honey that the sisters make. She begins working as August's bee keeping apprentice to repay her for her kindness, while Rosaleen works around the house. Lily finds out that May had a twin sister, April, who committed suicide with their father's shotgun when they were younger.<ref>Kidd, p. 97</ref> She watches June's ongoing flirtations with, and refusals of marriage to, her boyfriend Neil. Lily and Rosaleen also get to see the sisters' form of religion. They hold service at their house which they call "The Daughters of Mary." They keep a statue of "Black Mary", or "our lady of chains", which was actually a figurehead from the bow of an ancient ship, and August tells the story of how a man by the name of Obadiah, who was a slave, found this figure. The slaves thought that God had answered their prayers asking for rescue, and "to send them consolation" and "to send them freedom".<ref>(Kidd, pg. 108)</ref> It gave them hope, and the figure had been passed down for generations.  Lily meets Zach, August's godson. They soon develop intimate feelings for each other. They share goals with each other while working the hives. Both Lily and Zach find their goals nearly impossible to meet but still encourage each other to attempt them. Zach wants to be the "ass-busting lawyer", which means he would be the first black lawyer in the area.<ref>Kidd, p. 121</ref> Lily wants to be a short story writer.  Lily attempts to tell August the truth but is interrupted by Zach, who takes her for a honey run. They stop at a store to pick up a few things. Zach gets arrested after one of his friends, who they had met at the store, throws a coke bottle at a white man and none of them will tell who did it. Zach and his friends are arrested and put in jail. The Boatwright house decides not to tell May in fear of an unbearable emotional episode. The secret does not stay hidden for long and May becomes catatonic with depression.<ref>(Kidd, pg. 186)</ref> May leaves the house and August, June, Lily and Rosaleen find her lying dead in the river with a rock on her chest, an apparent suicide.  A vigil is held that lasts four days. In that time, Zach is freed from jail with no charges, and black cloth is draped over the beehives to symbolize the mourning. May's suicide letter is found and in it she says, "It's my time to die, and it's your time to live. Don't mess it up."<ref>Kidd, pg. 222</ref> August interprets this as urging June to marry Neil. May is later buried. Life begins to turn back to normal after a time of grieving, bringing the Boatwright house back together. June, after several rejections, agrees to give her hand in marriage to Neil. Zach vows to Lily that they will be together someday and that they will both achieve their goals.<ref>Kidd, pg. 231</ref>  Lily finally finds out the truth about her mother. August was her mother's nanny, and helped raise her. After her marriage to T. Ray began to sour, Deborah left and went to stay with the Boatwrights. She eventually decided to leave him permanently and returned to their house to collect Lily. While Deborah was packing to leave, T. Ray returned home. Their ensuing argument turned into a physical fight during which Deborah got a gun. After a brief struggle, the gun fell to the floor, which Lily picked up and the gun accidentally discharged, killing Deborah.  While Lily is coming to terms with this information, T. Ray shows up at the pink house to take her back home. Lily refuses, and T. Ray flies into an enraged rampage. He has a violent flashback which brings him around. August steps in and offers to let Lily stay with her. T. Ray gives in and agrees. However, right before T. Ray leaves the Boatwright house, Lily asks him what really happened the day her mother died.

The Story of an African Farm
  The novel details the lives of three characters, first as children and then as adults – Waldo, Em and Lyndall – who live on a farm in the [[Karoo]] region of South Africa. The story is set in the middle- to late-19th century – the [[First Boer War]] is alluded to, but not mentioned by name. The book is semi-autobiographical: in particular, the two principal protagonists (Waldo and Lyndall) display strong similarities to Schreiner's life and philosophy.  The book was first published in 1883 in London, under the pseudonym ''Ralph Iron''. It quickly became a best-seller, despite causing some controversy over its frank portrayal of [[freethought]], feminism, premarital sex and pregnancy out of wedlock, and [[transvestitism]].  ===Structure===  As there is only minimal narrative in the novel (and what there is only serves to support the book's many themes), it is a difficult book to summarise. In addition, much of the story is revealed as a series of vignettes – often devoid of context, or (deliberately) out of sequence. The author also frequently interjects into the narrative to address the reader directly. In general, the book may roughly be divided into three sections:  * The first section introduces us to the characters as children living on a farm in the [[Karoo]], and reveals their innermost thoughts and feelings.  * The second section is entitled "Times and Seasons" and largely summarises what has gone before, and alludes to incidents still to come. It deals primarily with Waldo's journey from Christian fanaticism to despairing [[atheism]]. This section is almost completely devoid of chronological context, although much of the philosophy presented is echoed in both the first and the third sections of the book. The second section makes almost exclusive use of the first person plural pronoun ("we", "us" etc.). The use of the plural underscores the fact that Schreiner saw Waldo as something of an [[alter ego]]. * The third section covers the lives of the three main characters as adults. Again, the focus is on Waldo and Lyndall, both of whom leave the farm and travel to different parts of South Africa, Waldo to the [[Natal Province|Natal]] area, and [[Grahamstown]], and Lyndall to [[Bloemfontein]] and then to the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]].  
Tam Lin (novel)
 The [[protagonist]] of ''Tam Lin'' is Janet Carter.  Written in the indirect third person, from Carter's point of view, the novel is set during her years as a student in the early 1970s at the fictional Blackstock College in [[Minnesota]]. The characters include her fellow students, professors at the college, her family, and a childhood friend. The plot combines the story of a young woman's life at college with a retelling of the traditional Scottish fairy ballad "[[Tam Lin]]".  
The Secret Magdalene
 The story begins in the voice of the [[Jew]]ess Mariamne as a child living a privileged life in her widowed father [[Joseph of Arimathea|Josephus]]’ home in [[Jerusalem]]. Also living with them is her father’s ward, [[Salome (disciple)|Salome]], an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]], the daughter of a deceased fellow merchant.  Both girls are overseen by a body servant named Tata. Mariamne has just recovered from a life-threatening illness. When she revives, she is gifted (or cursed) with unexpected voiced [[divination]]. Raised like sisters and indulged by a fond father with books and lessons usually only accorded boys, Mariamne and Salome possess a thirst for knowledge, both secular and magical, that is forbidden to females. Through their devoted personal slave, they also learn worldly experience far beyond anything Josephus, a member of the elite Jewish [[Sanhedrin]], would approve.  When Mariamne reveals her gift of [[prophesy]] in front of her father and his houseguest, a merchant named Ananias, Josephus sends her out of the room, but Ananias is intrigued.  Within months, Josephus, misunderstanding an exchange he sees between Salome and his houseguest, banishes Salome and the houseguest from his home and, hours later, Mariamne and her servant Tata.  His daughter has to go to her uncle's strict Jewish household, where she is allowed no books. Unable to bear the loss of Salome and her books, Mariamne decides to leave. She and Tata follow Salome into banishment. Mariamne is eleven years old; Salome is twelve.  For protection and ease of travel, Mariamne and Salome disguise themselves as boys. Dressed as males, they take male names: Salome is Simon; Mariamne is John. Ananias and his friends take the boys to the “Wilderness,” a hidden settlement on the northwest edge of the [[Dead Sea]].  They meet a man who will become Mariamne's mentor, the young philosopher Seth of Damascus, also a seeker of divine knowledge.  They meet [[John the Baptist]], hiding with other zealots in deserts. In the "Wilderness," they see evidence of the struggle for Jewish freedom from [[Roman Empire|Rome]], and the even more complex struggle for the Temple, where Roman-backed priests practice rites of animal sacrifice that enrage zealots. They learn there are many kinds of zealots, though all await a Messiah to lead them.  Salome comes to believe John the Baptist is that Messiah and a king of the Jews. Mariamne does not agree. Their differences increase after Mariamne meets John's cousin, a Galilean called Yeshua.  With Seth, they travel to [[Alexandria, Egypt]] where Mariamne and Salome live in the [[Library of Alexandria|Great Library]], becoming learned in [[mathematics]], philosophy, and [[poetry]]. Under the tutelage of [[Philo of Alexandria]], they learn the Egyptian mysteries, specifically the ancient passion of the man-god [[Osiris]].  After seven years, Mariamne reluctantly returns to the Wilderness, but Salome is eager to return to see John the Baptist. They continue their disguise as males. Having lived as males, they remain males. Through John of the River, Mariamne (now called John the Less) meets his cousin, [[Jesus Christ|Yeshua]] of [[Galilee]] and his twin brother, [[Judas Iscariot|Jude the Sicarii]].  John the Less shares with Yeshua knowledge from her studies in Egypt. Deeply confused and disturbed by the violent actions of those around him, and their expectations of a “king”, Yeshua retreats into the true wilderness of the Dead Sea region. He returns to share his revelation with his beloved friend, John the Less. Mariamne had undergone her own experience of gnosis years earlier and no longer recounts it, but Yeshua is filled with a messianic fervor to share his sense that all are divine. Mariamne (now John the Beloved Disciple) follows Yeshua as he teaches and heals, spreading his message of love and forgiveness to his followers, whose numbers continue to grow.  Eventually, Yeshua’s conviction leads him to the cross. Mariamne leaves Palestine for the south of France, then called the [[Gallia Narbonensis]]. Dying in a cave, she tells her story to Seth of Damascus, who writes it all down for her.  
Touba and the Meaning of Night
 Spanning eighty years, the novel follows the life of [[Tuba (given name)|Touba]], a young woman educated by her father in a time when few women received education. After her father passes away, Touba proposes to and marries a 52-year-old man. Initiated in desperation, the marriage causes Touba to fall into depression and eventually ends in a divorce. Touba later remarries a Prince of the [[Qajar Dynasty]]. Though her second marriage starts happily, it also ends in divorce when the Prince takes a second wife. After the divorce, Touba is left to raise their daughter on the dwindling allowance afforded by her former husband's diminishing dynasty. To compensate, Touba weaves rugs.

The Well of Loneliness
 [[File:Natalie Barney in Fur Cape.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Natalie Barney]], an American who lived in Paris and held a [[salon (gathering)|literary salon]] there, was the model for Valérie Seymour.<ref>Rodriguez, 274.</ref>]] The book's protagonist, Stephen Gordon, is born in the late [[Victorian era]]<ref>Baker, ''Our Three Selves'', 210.</ref> to upper-class parents in [[Worcestershire]] who are expecting a boy and who christen her with the name they had already chosen. Even at birth she is physically unusual, a "narrow-hipped, wide-shouldered little tadpole of a baby".<ref>Hall, 13.</ref> She hates dresses, wants to cut her hair short, and longs to be a boy. At seven, she develops a crush on a housemaid named Collins, and is devastated when she sees Collins kissing a [[footman]].  Stephen's father, Sir Phillip, dotes on her; he seeks to understand her through the writings of [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]], the first modern writer to propose a theory of homosexuality,<ref>Kennedy.</ref> but does not share his findings with Stephen. Her mother, Lady Anna, is distant, seeing Stephen as a "blemished, unworthy, maimed reproduction" of Sir Phillip.<ref>Hall, 15.</ref> At eighteen, Stephen forms a close friendship with a Canadian man, Martin Hallam, but is horrified when he declares his love for her. The following winter, Sir Phillip is crushed by a falling tree; at the last moment he tries to explain to Lady Anna that Stephen is an [[sexual inversion (sexology)|invert]], but dies without managing to do so.  Stephen begins to dress in masculine clothes made by a tailor rather than a dressmaker. At twenty-one she falls in love with Angela Crossby, the American wife of a new neighbour. Angela uses Stephen as an "[[anodyne]] against boredom", allowing her "a few rather schoolgirlish kisses".<ref>Hall, 147–149.</ref> Then Stephen discovers that Angela is having an affair with a man. Fearing exposure, Angela shows a letter from Stephen to her husband, who sends a copy to Stephen's mother. Lady Anna denounces Stephen for "presum[ing] to use the word love in connection with...these unnatural cravings of your unbalanced mind and undisciplined body." Stephen replies, "As my father loved you, I loved...It was good, good, ''good''&nbsp;– I'd have laid down my life a thousand times over for Angela Crossby."<ref>Hall, 201.</ref> After the argument, Stephen goes to her father's study and for the first time opens his locked bookcase. She finds a book by [[Krafft-Ebing]]&nbsp;– assumed by critics to be ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]'', a text about homosexuality and [[paraphilias]]<ref>Green, 284–285.</ref>&nbsp;– and, reading it, learns that she is an invert.  Stephen moves to London and writes a well-received first novel. Her second novel is less successful, and her friend the playwright Jonathan Brockett, himself an invert, urges her to travel to Paris to improve her writing through a fuller experience of life. There she makes her first, brief contact with urban invert culture, meeting the lesbian [[salon (gathering)|salon]] hostess Valérie Seymour. During World War I she joins an ambulance unit, eventually serving at the front and earning the [[Croix de Guerre]]. She falls in love with a younger fellow driver, Mary Llewellyn, who comes to live with her after the war ends. They are happy at first, but Mary becomes lonely when Stephen returns to writing. Rejected by [[wikt:polite society|polite society]], Mary throws herself into Parisian nightlife. Stephen believes Mary is becoming hardened and embittered and feels powerless to provide her with "a more normal and complete existence".<ref>Hall, 379.</ref>  Martin Hallam, now living in Paris, rekindles his old friendship with Stephen. In time, he falls in love with Mary. Persuaded that she cannot give Mary happiness, Stephen pretends to have an affair with Valérie Seymour to drive her into Martin's arms. The novel ends with Stephen's plea to God: "Give us also the right to our existence!"<ref>Hall, 437.</ref>  
The Women's Room
 Mira and her friends represent a wide cross-section of American society in the 1950s and 1960s. Mira herself is from a middle-class background. She is mildly rebellious in that she disagrees with her mother's view of the world.  In her late teens she dates a fellow student named Lanny; one night, when she was supposed to be out on a date with him, Lanny ignores her, and in response Mira dances with several men. Mira's actions in this instance gain her a reputation for being loose.  Through this experience and several others with Lanny, Mira realizes she does not want to marry him because he would leave her at home, alone, scrubbing floors.  Later, Mira marries Norm, a future doctor.  Mira and Norm have two sons, Norm, Jr. (referred to as Normie throughout the book) and Clark.  During the first few years of her marriage, Mira develops friendships with three neighborhood women: Natalie, Adele, and Bliss—all of whom are married with children.  The women begin to throw dinner parties in order to create fun evenings together that involve their husbands.  At the dinner parties there is flirtation among the different couples.  Natalie begins to believe that her husband and Mira are having an affair, but Mira is able to dismiss Natalie's accusation, and their bonds survive until Mira discovers that Bliss and Natalie are having affairs with Adele's husband.  The suspicion and actuality of affairs within the group results in irreversible damage to their friendships.  Mira and Norm later move to the small town of Beau Reve, where Mira meets fellow married women with children: Lily, Samantha, and Martha. During this time Mira's marriage becomes increasingly routine, and Mira finds herself at home, alone, scrubbing floors.  Also while in Beau Reve, Mira witnesses her friends' struggles: Lily goes mad as a result of her son's rebellious behavior, Samantha is evicted after her husband loses his job and leaves her, and Martha takes a married lover who simultaneously gets his wife pregnant. Through her friends, Mira begins to understand the unfair advantages enjoyed by men in relationships.  After many years of marriage, Norm files for divorce (it is hinted that he has been having an affair for some time) and remarries, leaving Mira on her own.  During this time, Mira, lost without her routine life of wifely duties, attempts to commit suicide. She is found by Martha, who helps her pick herself up.  Mira returns the help in due time when Martha, too, attempts suicide when trying to deal with her failed affair and resulting divorce.  Following her and Norm's divorce, Mira goes to [[Harvard University]] to study for a Ph.D. in English literature, with which she hopes to fulfill her lifelong dream of teaching. There she meets Val, a militant radical feminist divorcée with a "precocious" teenage daughter, Chris. It is the heyday of [[Women's Liberation]] and Mira, now too, finally able to verbalize her discontent at the society around her, becomes a feminist, although a less radical and militant one than Val. Their circle includes Isolde (a lesbian divorcée), Kyla (married to Harley), and Clarissa (married to Duke). It also includes Ben, a diplomat to the fictional African nation of Lianu, with whom Mira begins a relationship.    Mira and Ben have a happy relationship, in which Mira is able to maintain a sense of independence.  Mira's development in the relationship contributes to her new unwillingness to live the life of a stereotypical housewife.  When Mira's children come to visit her at Harvard, her growth and independence is revealed by a clear change in her views on the dichotomy between motherhood and sexuality.  While at college, Val's daughter, Chris, is raped.  Following Chris' rape, Val states (over Mira's protests), "Whatever they may be in public life, whatever their relationships with men, in their relationships with women, all men are [[rapists]], and that's all they are. They [[rape]] us with their eyes, their laws, and their codes."  This is one of the most quoted and criticized lines of the novel.  Mira later ends her relationship with Ben, after realizing that he expects her to return to Lianu with him and bear his children. Soon afterward, she discovers that Val has been shot following a violent protest at the trial of a rape victim.  The book ends with a brief summary of where the characters are now.  Ben married his secretary and now has two children.  Mira is teaching at a small  [[community college]] and is not dating anyone.  The ending is also a doubling back in which the narrator begins to write the story the reader has just read.  
A Woman With No Clothes On
 [[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe]]'', [[Musée d'Orsay]], 1862–1863 by [[Édouard Manet]]]]  The aristocratic [[Édouard Manet|Manet]] and the working-class [[Victorine Meurent]] narrate ''A Woman With No Clothes On''. A chance meeting between the two leads to an intense relationship of painting and sexual tension. Manet creates a scandal when he exhibits ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' and ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'' in which the naked model is a young Victorine. While critics and the general public dismiss the works, and label Victorine a common prostitute, she is determined to make her mark in the art world as a painter in her own right. Her bitter struggle to succeed is punctuated by the exchanges between Manet and his friend [[Baudelaire]] on the matter of modernism.  
The Valley of Amazement
 In the first part of the story, Violet tells the story of growing up in Hidden Jade Path, a courtesan house in [[Shanghai]] that is run by her mother, an American woman named Lulu Minturn. Violet grows up unaware of her father and unsure of her mother's feelings for her.  When the [[Qing dynasty]] falls in 1912, mother and daughter are separated and the young girl is sold to a rivaling courtesan house, where she is educated by an older girl, Magic Gourd, formerly of her mother's house. The two form a lifelong relationship through Violet's marriages to former clients. Her first marriage results in a child, Flora, who is taken from Violet as a result of an unlawful marriage.  The second part of the story is told by the mother, who thinks the daughter is dead. She recalls her upbringing by remote parents in the US, her runaway with an unknown Chinese painter, and her struggle to be accepted as the mother of their two children.  Violet is eventually reunited with her mother, and eventually also her daughter Flora.  
Umbertina
  '''Prologue'''  The prologue is set in Rome in the 1970s, with Marguerite, an American expatriate, in the office of her psychiatrist. Although living a comfortable middle-class life, Marguerite is floundering, without direction. She often thinks of her maternal grandmother, Umbertina, who had a "primitive strength" that Marguerite envies.  '''Part One: Umbertina, 1860-1940'''  At sixteen, Umbertina works as a [[goatherd]] in the hills above the [[Calabria]]n village of [[Castagna, Catanzaro|Castagna]]. She lives with her parents, brothers, and sisters in a one-room, dirt-floored stone cabin. Her father, Carlo Nenci, is a poor tenant farmer who toils for the Baron Mancuso di Valerba, an absentee landlord who takes half of everything produced by the villagers.  One day Giosuè, a charcoal maker from the next village, presents Umbertina with a heart-shaped holder for her knitting needles, which he made himself out of tin. Umbertina likes Giosuè, who has beautiful dark hair and eyes, but her father instead promises her to Serafino Longobardi, an older man who had fought in the [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Campaign of 1860|Campaign of 1860]]. Well in advance of the wedding, Umbertina asks the local priest's housekeeper, Nelda, to weave her a matrimonial bedspread in the traditional Calabrian style. It is the one valuable possession she will bring to her new home. She also asks Nelda for some [[rosemary]], hoping that once she is married she will at last have chicken to cook with it. Nelda tells her of an old saying: where rosemary thrives, "the women of that house are its strength."  Serafino buys a small plot of farmland, and Umbertina gives birth to three children. Oppressive taxes, high interest rates, and depleted soil make it impossible to break even. At Umbertina's urging, they decide to emigrate to America. They load their few possessions onto a donkey and, with a few of their neighbors, make their way to Naples where they board a ship for New York. For the next two years, the family lives in an overcrowded Italian ghetto. Umbertina takes in laundry while Serafino works as a laborer. They make the mistake of entrusting their meager savings to a fly-by-night immigrant bank, and are left with nothing. Umbertina sells her bedspread to a social worker, and the family moves to [[Cato (town), New York|Cato, New York]], where some of their old friends from Castagna have settled.  While Serafino labors at the railroad yard, the enterprising Umbertina begins selling freshly made pizza and panini to his co-workers for lunch. As the business expands, she leases farmland to grow fresh produce and opens a grocery store. She gives birth to five more children, including a daughter, Carla. The family business thrives, and the Longobardis become affluent and Americanized. On her deathbed, the elderly Umbertina has a vision of the lost bedspread with its intricately patterned design. Just before she dies, she asks her son for a cup of water from the spring in Castagna.  '''Part Two: Marguerite, 1927-1973'''  Carla's daughter Marguerite is restless, searching for something to give her life meaning. After college she travels to Italy, where she meets Alberto Morosini, a poet some twenty years her senior who comes from an old, established Venetian family. Planning to live together as artists, they marry and have two daughters, moving several times between Italy and the United States. While Alberto focuses on his successful writing career, Marguerite's attention is scattered. At forty-two she has an affair with a writer her own age, and uses her literary connections to try to help his career.  '''Part Three: Tina, 1950-'''  Marguerite's daughter Tina is living in New York when she receives the news that her mother has died in a car accident. She flies to Rome to be with her family. While still grieving her mother, she learns she is pregnant by her feckless American boyfriend, and endures a painful, illegal abortion. She begins spending time with Jason, a law student from an old, established New England family who is staying in Rome with his diplomat father. (Although Jason is a "Wasp," Tina thinks he looks Italian; his physical appearance echoes that of Giosuè in Part One.)  Tina struggles to choose a path in life. While touring southern Italy with Jason, she runs off with another man and visits her great grandmother's hometown. Unbeknownst to her, she ends up speaking to a descendant of Giosuè, who made the tin heart which she carries with her as a memento. She returns to the United States to continue her classical studies. One day she visits the [[Statue of Liberty]], and in the [[American Museum of Immigration|Museum of Immigration]], sees a beautiful Calabrian bedspread. Not realizing it once belonged to her great grandmother, Tina wishes Umbertina had brought something like that with her to America to pass down to her descendants.  Eventually Tina reunites with Jason and they become engaged. Unlike her mother, Tina is now able to commit herself as fully to a career as her fiancé. On a visit to Jason's family home in [[Wellfleet, Massachusetts]]&mdash;not far from where an Italian [[Barque|bark]], the ''Castagna'', was shipwrecked in 1914&mdash;she plants rosemary.
