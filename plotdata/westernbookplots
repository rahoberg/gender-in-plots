Around the World in Eighty Days
 The story starts in London on Tuesday, 1 October 1872.  Phileas Fogg is a rich British gentleman living in solitude. Despite his wealth, Fogg lives a modest life with habits carried out with mathematical precision. Very little can be said about his social life other than that he is a member of the [[Reform Club]]. Having dismissed his former [[valet]], James Forster, for bringing him shaving water at  instead of , Fogg hires [[French people|Frenchman]] [[Jean Passepartout]] as a replacement.  At the Reform Club, Fogg gets involved in an argument over an article in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' stating that with the opening of a new [[History of rail transport in India#The linking of the Indian Railways|railway section in India]], it is now possible to travel around the world in 80 days. He accepts a wager for £20,000 (£2,075,400 in 2017)<ref> Bank of England|website=www.bankofengland.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref> from his fellow club members to complete such a journey within this time period. With Passepartout accompanying him, Fogg departs from London by train at 8:45&nbsp;p.m. on 2 October; if he is to win the wager, then he will have to return to the club by this same time on 21 December, 80 days later.  {| class="wikitable"  style="margin:auto; margin:auto;" |- |+'''The itinerary''' (as originally planned) | London to [[Suez]], Egypt || Rail to [[Brindisi]], Italy, and steamer (the ''Mongolia'') across the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. || 7 days |- | Suez to [[Mumbai|Bombay]], India || Steamer (the ''Mongolia'') across the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. || 13 days |- | Bombay to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], India || Rail. || 3 days |- | Calcutta to [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria]], [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] || Steamer (the ''Rangoon'') across the [[South China Sea]] || 13 days |- | Hong Kong to [[Yokohama]], Japan || Steamer (the ''[[SS Carnatic|Carnatic]]'') across the South China Sea, [[East China Sea]], and the [[Pacific Ocean]]. || 6 days |- | Yokohama to [[San Francisco]], United States || Steamer (the ''General Grant'') across the Pacific Ocean. || 22 days |- | San Francisco to [[New York City]], United States || Rail. || 7 days |- | New York to London || Steamer (the ''China'') across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to [[Liverpool]] and rail. || 9 days |- | colspan="2"|'''Total''' ||  |- | colspan="3" style="font-size: 90%; text-align: center"|[[File:Around the World in Eighty Days map.png|780px|center|Map of the trip]] Map of the trip |}   Fogg and Passepartout reach Suez in time. While disembarking in Egypt, they are watched by a [[Scotland Yard]] detective, Detective Fix, who has been dispatched from London in search of a bank robber. Since Fogg fits the vague description Scotland Yard was given of the robber, Detective Fix mistakes Fogg for the criminal. Since he cannot secure a warrant in time, Fix boards the steamer (the ''Mongolia'') conveying the travelers to Bombay. Fix becomes acquainted with Passepartout without revealing his purpose. Fogg promises the steamer engineer a large reward if he gets them to Bombay early. They dock two days ahead of schedule.  After reaching India they take a train from [[Mumbai|Bombay]] to [[Calcutta]]. Fogg learns that the ''Daily Telegraph'' article was wrong – the railroad actually ends at Kholby and starts again, 50 miles further on, near Allahabad, Fogg purchases an elephant, hires a guide, and starts toward Allahabad.  They come across a procession in which a young Indian woman, [[Aouda]], is to undergo [[Sati (practice)|sati]]. Since she is drugged with [[opium]] and [[Cannabis (drug)|hemp]] and is obviously not going voluntarily, the travelers decide to rescue her. They follow the procession to the site, where Passepartout takes the place of Aouda's deceased husband on the funeral pyre. During the ceremony he rises from the pyre, scaring off the priests, and carries Aouda away. The twelve hours gained earlier are lost, but Fogg shows no regret.  The travelers hasten to catch the train at the next railway station, taking Aouda with them. At Calcutta, they board a steamer (the ''Rangoon'') going to Hong Kong. Fix has Fogg and Passepartout arrested. They jump bail and Fix follows them to Hong Kong. He shows himself to Passepartout, who is delighted to again meet his travelling companion from the earlier voyage.  In Hong Kong, it turns out that Aouda's distant relative, in whose care they had been planning to leave her, has moved to [[Holland]], so they decide to take her with them to Europe. Still without a warrant, Fix sees Hong Kong as his last chance to arrest Fogg on British soil. Passepartout becomes convinced that Fix is a spy from the Reform Club. Fix confides in Passepartout, who does not believe a word and remains convinced that his master is not a bank robber. To prevent Passepartout from informing his master about the premature departure of their next vessel, the ''Carnatic,'' Fix gets Passepartout drunk and drugs him in an opium den. Passepartout still manages to catch the steamer to Yokohama, but neglects to inform Fogg that the steamer is leaving the evening before its scheduled departure date.  Fogg discovers that he missed his connection. He searches for a vessel that will take him to [[Yokohama]], finding a pilot boat, the ''Tankadere'', that takes him and Aouda to [[Shanghai]], where they catch a steamer to Yokohama. In Yokohama, they search for Passepartout, believing that he may have arrived there on the ''Carnatic'' as originally planned. They find him in a circus, trying to earn the fare for his homeward journey. Reunited, the four board a paddle-steamer, the ''General Grant,'' taking them across the [[Pacific]] to [[San Francisco]]. Fix promises Passepartout that now, having left British soil, he will no longer try to delay Fogg's journey, but instead support him in getting back to Britain so he can arrest Fogg in Britain itself.  In San Francisco they board a [[First Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental]] train to New York, encountering a number of obstacles along the way: a massive herd of [[bison]] crossing the tracks, a failing [[suspension bridge]], and the train being attacked by [[Sioux]] warriors. After uncoupling the locomotive from the carriages, Passepartout is kidnapped by the Indians, but Fogg rescues him after American soldiers volunteer to help. They continue by a [[wind power]]ed [[sledge]] to [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], where they get a train to New York.  In New York, having missed the ship ''China,'' Fogg looks for alternative transport. He finds a steamboat, the ''Henrietta,'' destined for [[Bordeaux, France]]. The captain of the boat refuses to take the company to Liverpool, whereupon Fogg consents to be taken to Bordeaux for $2,000 (£207,540 in 2017) per passenger. He then bribes the crew to [[mutiny]] and make course for Liverpool. Against hurricane winds and going on full steam, the boat runs out of fuel after a few days. Fogg buys the boat from the captain and has the crew burn all the wooden parts to keep up the steam.  The companions arrive at [[Cobh|Queenstown]] (Cobh), Ireland, take the train to [[Dublin]] and then a ferry to [[Liverpool]], still in time to reach London before the deadline. Once on English soil, Fix produces a warrant and arrests Fogg. A short time later, the misunderstanding is cleared up – the actual robber, an individual named James Strand, had been caught three days earlier in [[Edinburgh]]. However, Fogg has missed the train and arrives in London five minutes late, certain he has lost the wager.  The following day Fogg apologises to Aouda for bringing her with him, since he now has to live in poverty and cannot support her. Aouda confesses that she loves him and asks him to marry her. As Passepartout notifies a minister, he learns that he is mistaken in the date – it is not 22 December, but instead 21 December. Because the party had travelled eastward, they gained one day upon crossing the [[International Date Line]]. Passepartout informs Fogg of his mistake, and Fogg hurries to the Reform Club just in time to meet his deadline and win the wager. Having already spent the bulk of the £20,000 during the journey, he divides the remaining money between Passepartout and Fix and marries Aouda.  This narrative gives a mistaken impression of the ending. For the trip, Fogg took £20,000, in cash, in a suitcase, amounting to half of his fortune at the time. The other half of his fortune, the other £20,000 was to be held in escrow at the bank to pay off his wager if he lost, the men on the other side of the bet, similarly put £20,000 to be held during the wager. Much of what Fogg took with him was spent during the trip, as detailed above. Before the date was discovered, Fogg confessed to Aouda that he was now poor, but she wanted to marry him anyway, as set out above. When the true date was discovered, as above, Fogg collected the £20,000 wageredand his £20,000 that was held in escrow, restoring him to his original fortune of £40,000, distributing the remaining balance of his "travel money".  
Angle of Repose
  Lyman Ward narrates a century after the fact. Lyman interprets the story at times and leaves gaps that he points out at other times. Some of the disappointments of his life, including his divorce, color his interpretation of his grandparents' story. Toward the end of the novel, he gives up on his original ambition of writing a complete biography of his grandmother.  Stegner's use of [[Mary Hallock Foote]]'s historical letters gives the novel's locations—[[Grass Valley, California|Grass Valley]], [[Leadville, CO|Leadville]], [[New Almaden]], [[Idaho]], and [[Mexico]]—an authentic feel; the letters also add vividness to the Wards' struggles with the environment, shady businessmen, and politicians.  Lyman's position in the contemporary culture of the late sixties provides another historical dimension to the story.  Foils for this plot line include Lyman's adult son, a Berkeley-trained sociologist who sees little value in history, and a neighbor's daughter who helps transcribe Lyman's tape-recorded notes while she is home on summer break from UC Berkeley, where she has been active in the "hippie" counterculture movement.  
All the Pretty Horses (novel)
 The novel tells of John Grady Cole, a 16-year-old who grew up on his grandfather's ranch in [[San Angelo]], [[Texas]]. The boy was raised for a significant part of his youth, perhaps 15 of his 16 years, by a family of Mexican origin who worked on the ranch; he is a native speaker of Spanish and English.<ref>Herlihy-Mera, Jeffrey. "[https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/modern_fiction_studies/v061/61.3.herlihy-mera.pdf Mojado Reverso; or, A Reverse Wetback: On John Grady Cole’s Mexican Ancestry in ''All the Pretty Horses''"], ''Modern Fiction Studies'', Fall 2015.  Retrieved: 15 October 2015.</ref> The story begins in 1949, soon after the death of John Grady's grandfather when Grady learns the ranch is to be sold. Faced with the prospect of moving into town, Grady instead chooses to leave and persuades his best friend, Lacey Rawlins, to accompany him. Traveling by horseback, the pair travel southward into Mexico, where they hope to find work as cowboys.  Shortly before they cross the Mexican border, they encounter a young man who says he is named Jimmy Blevins and who seems to be about 13 but claims to be older. Blevins' origins and the authenticity of his name are never quite clarified. Blevins rides a huge [[Bay (horse)|bay horse]] that is far too fine a specimen to be the property of a runaway boy, but Blevins insists it is his. As they travel south through a severe thunderstorm, Blevins' horse runs off,  and he loses his pistol.  Blevins persuades John Grady and Rawlins to accompany him to the nearest town to find the horse and his distinctive vintage Colt pistol. They find both but have no way to prove Blevins' ownership. Against his companions' better judgment, Blevins steals back the horse. As the three are riding away from the town they are pursued, and Blevins separates from Rawlins and John Grady. The pursuers follow Blevins, and Rawlins and Grady escape.  Rawlins and John Grady travel farther south. In the fertile oasis region of [[Coahuila]] known as the Bolsón de [[Cuatro Ciénegas]], they find employment at a large ranch. There, John Grady first encounters the ranch owner's beautiful daughter, Alejandra. As Rawlins pursues work with the ranch hands, John Grady's skill with horses catches the eye of the owner, who brings him into the ranch house and promotes him to a more responsible position as a horse trainer and breeder. At this time, John Grady begins an affair with Alejandra, which attracts the attention of Alejandra's great aunt, an intelligent and strong-willed widow who in her younger days defied social convention by being involved with Mexican revolutionaries. She tells John Grady about the consequences in Mexican society of a woman losing her honor, and how Alejandra can ill-afford to be seen in the presence of John Grady due to its potential impact on her reputation. The aunt recounts her own story of love and loss, and says, though it might seem she would be sympathetic to her own grandniece's desire, it, in fact, has the opposite impact; she opposes their involvement.  As John Grady and Alejandra secretly become more deeply involved, a group of Mexican Rangers visit the ranch and then ride off without explanation. Alejandra returns to Mexico City, where she is in school, and John Grady plans to ask her to admit her true feelings for him upon her return. When he confides this to a senior ranch hand who has been kind to him, John Grady is surprised to learn Alejandra has returned to the ranch without coming to see him.  Somewhat later, the Rangers return and arrest Rawlins and John Grady. They are brought to a dismal Mexican holding cell where they discover Blevins is also in custody. They learn Blevins had escaped his pursuers but subsequently returned to the village where he had recovered his horse, this time to retrieve the [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] pistol. In the process of getting the pistol, he shot and killed a man.  The three boys are interrogated and beaten, and a crooked police captain threatens them. While they are being transferred from their small jail to a larger prison, the captain and police officers detour to a remote ranch. Blevins is led off while Rawlins and John Grady watch powerlessly; then they hear gunshots as Blevins is executed.  The two friends are brought to the larger prison, where the inmates test the two boys by attacking them relentlessly over a period of days. They barely survive and try to figure out how to get out of prison; an inmate with special privileges, who seems to command the respect of the other inmates, takes an interest in their situation and suggests money might solve their problem. They decline this offer of protection, because they have no money and Rawlins is soon severely wounded by a knife-wielding inmate and is taken away; Grady is not sure if Rawlins has survived. Soon afterward, Grady is wounded while defending himself from a ''[[wikt:cuchillero|cuchillero]]'' and kills the man.  After a long recovery from his near-fatal stabbing, Grady is released and finds Rawlins has also survived and been freed. They discover that Alejandra's aunt has interceded to free them, but on the condition that Alejandra undertake never to see John Grady again.  Rawlins returns to the United States and John Grady tries to see Alejandra again. In the end, after a brief encounter, Alejandra decides she must keep her promise to her family and refuses John Grady's marriage proposal. John Grady, on his way back to Texas, kidnaps the captain at gunpoint, forces him to recover the horses and guns that were taken from him, Rawlins, and Blevins, and flees across the country. He is severely wounded in the escape and cauterizes a serious gunshot wound using his pistol barrel heated in a fire.  He considers killing the captain but encounters a group of Mexicans who call themselves "men of the country," who take the captain as a prisoner. John Grady eventually returns to Texas and spends months trying to find the owner of Blevins' horse. He gains legal possession of the horse in a court hearing where he recounts the entire story of his journey across the border, and the judge later tries to absolve Grady of his guilt both for killing the prisoner who attacked him and for being unable to prevent Blevins being murdered.  John Grady briefly reunites with Rawlins to return his horse and learns that his own father has died (something he has already intuited). After watching the burial procession of one of his family's lifelong employees (an elderly Mexican woman who had helped care for three generations of his family from their infancy), the last strong link to his family and his past, John Grady rides off into the West with Blevins's horse in tow.  
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (novel)
 The title is based on a folk song of the era. Based on deep research, the novel imagines the lives of Jesse James, his brother Frank and their followers, including their [[guerrilla]] activities during the [[American Civil War]] and their insurgency afterward as robbers. While they achieved a folk status, the novel reveals they kept all their money for themselves.  
The Adventures of Sajo and her Beaver People
 Sajo, a young [[Ojibwe]] Indian girl, and her older brother adopt two young [[beaver]]s, Chilawee and Chikanee, and try to save them from fur traders.  
The Big Sky (novel)
  Boone Caudill is a young man who lives in [[Kentucky]] with his family as people are pushing further and further west in the Americas. (Boone is supposedly named after [[Daniel Boone]], who is credited with finding Kentucky.) Boone's father is physically abusive to not only his mother, but also his brother and him. One night, his father begins to beat him after Boone had caused trouble in town, and Boone hits his father over the head with a stick from the wood pile. Knowing that his father is seriously injured, possibly even dead, he goes back to the house and steals his father's prize rifle. As a parting gift, his mother offers him a roast chicken they were going to have for supper. With that, Boone runs away.<ref>''The Big Sky'', Chapter I</ref>  After thinking back to his childhood, he remembers his maternal uncle Zeb Calloway. The uncle was a mountain man, frequently thought of as uncivilized by his mother and father. Boone decides this is the life for him and sets off for the West and the mountains. As he walks, he meets a man with a cart and mule named Jim Deakins, who admits to Boone that he has always wanted something more from life and decides that Boone has the right idea. As they arrive into the next city, Jim decides to sell his mule and wagon for some money to travel and join Boone. However, as they get into town, Boone's father has just arrived and is intent on getting his rifle back. Boone jumps in the nearby river to get away, as Jim shouts from the banks of the river for Boone to wait for him.  As Boone sets out again, he meets another traveler, Jonathan Bedwell. Bedwell gets Boone drunk and then steals his rifle, to Boone's horror. He continues to travel, now without the rifle, though intent on getting it back. However, he sees Bedwell outside of another town, and attacks him. The sheriff had been nearby and breaks them up. The sheriff takes them to court, and after a quick trial the more sophisticated Bedwell is given the rights to the rifle, as everyone believes it is his anyway. Boone is sentenced to spend time in the jail, but he refuses to admit that he did anything wrong so the sheriff flogs him in hopes of getting a confession.  Meanwhile, Jim Deakins is traveling up the same path that Boone had taken. After getting the story out of the locals, he pretends to merely be curious about the goings-on. As he gets the sheriff progressively drunker, he steals the keys to the jail and sets Boone free. They go back to the inn where everyone had been drinking.  Boone steals a horse and they flee the area for St. Louis.<ref>Chapter VIII</ref>  Boone and Deakins travel for a while before they get recruited onto a French keelboat traveling up the Missouri River.<ref>Chapter IX</ref> There the boys meet Dick Summers, the boat's hunter and guide, who becomes a role model for Boone in particular, whose explosive temper has gotten into more trouble than he's been able to completely avoid. On the boat, the captain has a Native American princess named Teal Eye. The captain and mate have strictly forbidden any of the crew to talk to her, as they believe it will help relations with the Blackfoot chief for them to bring him back his daughter and they don't want to bring back damaged goods. Boone sneaks looks at the girl, almost instantly falling in love with her.  When they reach Blackfoot country, Teal Eye disappears one night.<ref>Chapter XIX</ref>  Soon after, the Blackfeet attack and destroy the keelboat and kill everyone on her except the three friends Caudill, Deakins, and Summers, who manage to escape.  A good portion of the novel involves Boone Caudill becoming a fur trapper and dealing with the hardships as he moves further from civilization.  Dick Summers realizes that he is too old to continue the life of a mountain man and leaves Jim Deakins and Boone Caudill to return to his land in Missouri to farm.<ref>Chapter XXV</ref>  Boone continues to be obsessed with Teal Eye, and eventually he is able to find her again.  By that time large numbers of the Blackfeet have been killed by smallpox.  With gifts Boone manages to convince Teal Eye's brother, now the chief since the death of their father, to let him have Teal Eye, who uses sign language to tell Boone that she loves him.<ref>Chapters XXIX-XXX</ref> Jim Deakins, Teal Eye and Boone live peacefully within the tribe, Boone finally feeling as if he's found a place to fit in. Teal Eye eventually gets pregnant, to Boone's joy. However, when the child is born, he is blind.  He also has red hair, like Boone's closest friend Jim Deakins. Believing Teal Eye cheated on him, Boone is crushed. He proceeds to kill Jim Deakins and leave Teal Eye, fleeing back east.<ref>Chapter XLII</ref>  When Boone arrives back in Kentucky, his mother notes that there have been red heads in their family.  Boone cannot tolerate his confusion and the settled life and mores in Kentucky and, depending on one's point of view, either seduces or rapes a young neighbor girl, who despite her sobbing asks when they'll get married.  That same night he flees west:  "He didn't realize he was running until he saw [his dog] trotting to keep up."<ref>End of Chapter XLVII.</ref>  Boone stops at Dick Summers's farm in Missouri.   In a theme repeated throughout Guthrie's trilogy, Boone refers to the destruction of the pristine West the first whites had known:  "It's all sp'iled, I reckon, Dick.  The whole caboodle."  Boone blurts out that he killed Jim Deakins:  "This here hand done it. ... I kilt Jim."<ref>Chapter XLVIII.</ref>  Rather than spend even that one night with Dick Summers, Boone Caudill flees out the door.  
Blood Meridian
 The novel follows an adolescent runaway from Tennessee with a predilection for violence, known only as "the kid," who is introduced as being born during the famous [[Leonids]] [[meteor shower]] of 1833. In the late 1840s, he first encounters an enormous and completely hairless character, Judge Holden, at a [[Revival meeting|religious revival]] in [[Nacogdoches, Texas]]. There, Holden shows his dark nature by falsely accusing a preacher of raping both a young girl and a goat, inciting those attending the revival to physically attack the preacher.  The kid carries on journeying alone on his mule through the plains of [[eastern Texas]], and he spends a night in the shelter of a recluse before arriving in "Bexar". After a violent encounter with a bartender which establishes the kid as a formidable fighter, he joins a party of ill-armed [[United States Army]] [[Irregular military|irregulars]], led by a Captain White, on a [[Filibuster (military)|filibustering mission]] to claim Mexican land for the United States. Shortly after entering [[Mexico]], they are attacked, and many killed, by a band of [[Comanche]] warriors. Arrested in [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], the kid is set free when his cell neighbor and prior acquaintance from Texas, the earless Louis Toadvine, tells the authorities that the two of them would make useful recruits for the state's newly-hired scalp hunting operation, led by John Joel Glanton.  Toadvine and the kid consequently join Glanton's gang. The bulk of the novel details the gang's conversations and depraved, murderous activities as they travel on horseback throughout the borderlands. The gang encounters a [[traveling carnival]], and, in untranslated Spanish, each of their fortunes is told with [[Tarot cards]]. The gang originally contracts with various regional leaders to exterminate [[Apache]]s and are given a [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] for each scalp they recover. Before long, however, they murder almost anything in their path, including peaceful agrarian Indians, unprotected Mexican villagers, and even Mexican and American soldiers.  Judge Holden, who re-enters the story as a fellow scalp hunter in the Glanton gang, is presented as a profoundly mysterious and awe-inspiring figure; the others seem to regard him as not quite human. Despite his refined manner and remarkable intellect, the judge often proves to be among the most ruthless and bloodthirsty members of the gang, and is strongly implied to prey on children during their travels. According to an ex-priest gang member named Ben Tobin, the Glanton gang first met the judge while fleeing from the onslaught of a much larger group of Apaches. In the middle of the desert, the gang found Holden sitting on an enormous boulder, where he seemed to be waiting for them all. He took them to an extinct volcano, and improvised gunpowder from natural materials, enough to give them the advantage against their Apache pursuers. When the kid remembers seeing Holden in Nacogdoches, Tobin explains that each man in the gang claims to have met the judge at some point before joining Glanton's gang.  After months of marauding, the gang crosses into the [[Mexican Cession]], where they set up a systematic and brutal robbery operation at a ferry on the [[Colorado River]] near [[Yuma, Arizona]]. Local [[Quechan|Yuma]] (Quechan) Indians are approached to help the gang wrest control of the ferry from its original owner, but Glanton's gang betrays the natives, using their presence and previously coordinated attack on the ferry as an excuse to seize the ferry's munitions and slaughter the Yuma. Because of the new operators' brutal ways, a group of US Army soldiers sets up a second ferry at a [[ford (crossing)|ford]] upriver to cross—which the Yuma briefly appropriate until their ferryman is decapitated and thrown in the river. Eventually, after the gang had amassed a large fortune through robbing settlers using the ferry, the Yumas suddenly attack the gang and kill most of them including Glanton, though Holden (after fighting off the Yumas using his immense strength to level a [[howitzer]] by hand) survives and escapes.  The kid, Toadvine, and Tobin are among the few other survivors who escape into the desert, although the kid takes an arrow in the leg. Heading west together, the kid and Tobin encounter a weaponless and hatless Judge Holden and his accompanying imbecile arriving at a watering-hole. The judge negotiates successfully for Tobin's hat and unsuccessfully for the kid's pistol, and invites them to share in the 'common'  water. The kid and Tobin leave the watering hole and move on through the desert. The next evening at another watering site, they have a surprise-attack shoot-out with the judge, who fires a non-fatal shot to Tobin's neck. The kid shoots the two horses the judge came with. As Tobin and the kid hide among bones near the desert creek, the judge delivers a speech about property rights (regarding the shot horses) and advises the kid to reveal himself. Ignoring this, Tobin and the kid continue their travels, both wounded and much weakened. The judge is following the trail and them, a few miles behind. The next day they slightly side-track off the trail and hide, hoping to let the judge pass them by, and lose their trail. The judge does repeatedly pass by them, quite near and initially unaware; and soon addresses them aloud, knowing they are nearby and hiding.  Although the kid has had three easy clear-shot opportunities to shoot the judge as Tobin strongly advises, he doesn't take the shots. The judge and the imbecile then leave. Tobin and the kid are in quite bad shape and would likely have died out in the desert, but some benevolent indians rescue them and they survive.  Both parties end up in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], but the kid gets separated from Tobin when he is caught by local authorities and imprisoned. Holden visits him in jail, stating that he told the jailers "the truth": that the kid alone was responsible for the end of the Glanton gang. The kid declares that the judge was responsible for the gang's evils, but the judge denies it. After reaching through the cell bars to try to touch the kid, Holden leaves the kid alone, stating that he "has errands." The kid is released and seeks a doctor to treat his wound. Under the influence of medicinal [[Diethyl Ether|ether]], he hallucinates that the judge is visiting him, along with a curious man who forges coins. The kid recovers and seeks out Tobin, with no luck. He makes his way to [[Los Angeles]], where he witnesses the executions of Toadvine and David Brown—leaving now only Tobin, whose fate is uncertain, the judge, and the kid.  The kid again wanders across the American West. In 1878, he makes his way to [[Fort Griffin]], Texas and is now referred to by the author as "the man." The lawless city is a center for processing the remains of the [[American bison]], which have been hunted nearly to extinction. At a [[Western saloon|saloon]], where a traveling roadshow performs with a trained dancing bear, the man yet again meets the judge, who does not seem to have aged in the intervening years. Holden calls the man "the last of the true," and the pair talk on equal terms. Holden describes the man as a disappointment, stating that the man held in his heart "clemency for the heathen." Holden declares prophetically that the man has arrived at the saloon for "the dance." A drunk man shoots the dancing bear, and the man tells the judge, "You aint nothin," and, noting the dead bear, says that "even a dumb animal can dance."  The man hires a prostitute, then afterward goes to an [[outhouse]] under another meteor shower. In the outhouse, he is surprised by the naked judge there waiting for him, who "gather[s] him in his arms against his immense and terrible flesh." This is the last mention of the man. As two men from the saloon approach the outhouse, another man admonishes them not to open the door. They do so anyway, and gaze in awed horror at what they see, stating only, "Good God almighty." The last paragraph finds the judge back in the saloon, dancing in the nude and playing fiddle wildly among the drunkards and prostitutes, claiming that he never sleeps, and will never die.  A brief [[epilogue]] features an unspecified person augering a row of holes across the prairie. The worker sparks a fire in each of the holes while an assortment of passionless wanderers crosses the row. The line of holes is described as "a validation of sequence and causality as if each round and perfect hole owed its existence to the one before it there on that prairie."  
The Border Legion
 It tells the story of a cold hearted man named Jack Kells who falls in love with Miss Joan Randle, a girl his legion has taken captive near the Idaho border.  
The Big Country (Hamilton novel)
 [[Maryland]] sea captain James McKay goes west to [[Texas]], to claim his bride, and steps into a violent feud over water.  
The Bandit of Hell's Bend
  Elias Henders is the prosperous owner of a ranch and a gold mine. Competing for his daughter Diana, ranch hand Colby sabotages recovering alcoholic foreman Bull, and takes his job. The local stage is repeatedly robbed of gold bullion from the owner's mine, and Bull is suspected. The cowardly sheriff does not take action on the robberies. Rich Easterner Wainwright tries to buy the mine and ranch for a low price, but Henders refuses the offer and discusses the property's true value with Diana. She is intrigued by Wainwright's Eastern-educated son Jefferson, who proposes marriage. However, when they are attacked by Indians during the roundup, he runs rather than defend her. Henders is mortally wounded in the battle.  Henders will bequeaths his property to his brother John back East so that he can take care of Diana, but John dies too. The Wainwrights pretend that Henders had agreed to a sale, but Diana knows better. Diana's Eastern cousin Lillian brings Corson, a lawyer, to try to seize the ranch and gold mine. They insist that the ranch and mine are nearly played out, and that they should sell the property, offering her a small amount. They show their ignorance about western ways. Bull encourages Diana that the property is worth more than they say, and advises her that the Wainwrights are often at the mine. The Eastern lawyer finally announces that Diana has no property rights due to the wills.  As pressure from the opposing forces builds, a mob goes to hang Bull for the stage robberies, but Diana warns him in time. Bull discovers there are papers that will prove Diana's claim to the property, and that Lillian has seduced Colby to obtain his help. Bull actually does rob the stage, simply to obtain the papers supporting Diana. Diana recognizes him at the robbery, and is devastated because she is starting to have feelings for him. She orders the Wainwrights, Lillian and Corson off the property, and fires Colby.  Bull has the Mexican Gregorio deliver the important papers to Diana, showing that Lillian is not related to John and thus not entitled to the property. The villains try to take over the ranch.

He claims to be rescuing her, but she knows that she does not love him. Bull follows her doggedly, and eventually rescues her. They return to town, stop the illegal title transfers and announce their impending marriage.  
The Brave Cowboy
 This book is the story of a [[cowboy]], Jack Burns, who lives as a transient worker and roaming ranch hand much as the cowboys of old did, and refuses to join modern society.  He rejects much of modern technology, prefers to cut down any fence he comes across, will not carry any kind of modern identification such as a [[driver's license]] or [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] card, and refuses to register for the [[Selective Service|draft]].   When his friend Paul Bondi, who is a philosophical [[anarchist]], is jailed in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]], for refusing to register for the draft, Burns deliberately gets himself arrested in an attempt to [[prison escape|break]] his friend out of [[Prison|jail]], but winds up on the run from the law himself.  Bondi has been tried and is awaiting transport from [[Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court#Metropolitan Detention Center|county jail]] to federal prison but refuses to escape with Burns. As police have discovered that Burns has also never registered for the draft, authorities are intent on sending Burns to trial and eventually federal prison for violation of the Selective Service Act of 1948. Burns eventually escapes reluctantly leaving his friend behind.  After a brief stop to say goodbye to Paul's wife, Jerry, and son, Seth, Jack heads into the [[Sandia Mountains]], just east of Albuquerque, on horseback.  The police mount a manhunt and pull out all the stops to capture Burns, including helicopters on loan by the Air Force. If Burns can scale the mountain range, he figures he can escape under the cover of the forest on the other side. The police know this as well, so they position themselves to prevent that from happening.  
Breakheart Pass (novel)
 The story begins with a perilous winter railroad journey through the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain chain in the 1870s in the midst of a [[blizzard]]. Aboard the train are [[Nevada]] state governor Fairchild and his niece Marica, along with [[United States Cavalry|U.S. Army cavalry]] [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Claremont and two carloads of troops. Joining them are [[United States Marshal|U.S. Marshal]] Pearce, the governor's aide, and Pearce's old Army buddy Major O'Brien. Pearce, a lawman and [[Indian agent]] is transporting supposedly dangerous murderer and gunman John Deakin. Their destination is the remote [[Fort Humboldt]] deep in the Nevada mountains, whose troops have recently been decimated by a [[cholera]] epidemic. Dr. Molyneaux, a tropical disease expert, is also accompanying the group.  As the journey continues we slowly learn that all is not what it seems, and that none of the characters is telling the whole truth. MacLean meticulously obliterates the lines defining exactly which characters are the good guys and which are the bad. As the story winds down, the cunningly devious nature of the plan is finally revealed.

Butcher's Crossing
 William Andrews, a Harvard student in the early 1870s,<ref name=":2" /> is not happy with the mundanities of everyday life. After becoming inspired by the poetry and philosophy of Ralph Waldo Emerson,<ref name=":5" /> he decides to leave his home in Boston and spend some time in the wilderness. While he is there, he hopes to discover who he really is.  Andrews travels across the country and finds his way to Butcher's Crossing, a tiny frontier town on the Kansas plains which is supported mostly by the business of local hunters and cattle ranchers, and which eagerly awaits the economic prosperity promised by the construction of a railroad through the town. Andrews seeks out J.D. McDonald, an old acquaintance of his father's, and finds him running a lucrative business in the trade of buffalo hides on the edge of town. McDonald offers Will a job doing paperwork for him, but Will turns him down, explaining that he's looking for a different kind of experience in the West; McDonald chastises him for his youthful idealism and naiveté, but points him to a local hunter named Miller. Miller is a seasoned mountain man and expert buffalo hunter and talks Andrews into joining him on a hunting trip.<ref name=":4" /> Miller claims to have stumbled upon a remote mountain vale in Colorado years ago, where a rare buffalo herd lives that few people have ever seen and which therefore promises a big payout.<ref name=":5" /> Andrews agrees to finance the trip, if only because he is looking for adventure. Miller leaves behind Andrews and Charley Hoge, Miller's one-armed wagon driver, as he takes Andrews' money to [[Ellsworth, Kansas|Ellsworth]] to buy supplies. Hoge is a quiet and pious Christian and a fierce alcoholic who proves a challenge in conversation since he seems almost single-mindedly focused on his Bible and his whiskey; he likes to say Bible verses aloud, but Andrews believes that he knows all that he needs to about God.<ref name=":4" /> While Andrews waits for Miller to return, he sits in his hotel room and contemplates his life and the natural world around him.<ref name=":5" /> He meets a prostitute named Francine who is attracted to him, but Andrews is unnerved by his perceptions of her profession and refuses to sleep with her.  Miller eventually returns with a hired skinner named Fred Schneider, who will make the fourth member of the group, and the expedition quickly departs Butcher's Crossing to reach the mountains before winter. Relying solely on Miller's memory of the trail and knowledge of the landscape, the group cuts overland, off the blazed trail, as Miller insists on his ability to find water, to the annoyance of Schneider, who had argued for following the [[Smoky Hill River|river]]. The expedition almost fails after several days without water, but on the third day, they find a stream.<ref name=":5" /> The group finally arrives in the foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and Miller leads them to a scarcely used trail that takes them over a pass and into the hidden valley he had promised. They immediately see that the pristine valley is filled with an enormous herd of buffalo, numbering in the thousands. They set up a base camp and quickly begin the hunt. Miller carefully plans a systematic extermination that will prevent the herd from breaking up into smaller herds or escaping the valley; he serves as the primary rifler while Andrews and Schneider work at skinning the hides from the fallen corpses and Charley Hoge picks up the hides in the wagon. Andrews is at first appalled and sickened by the mass slaughter, by the reduction of the noble buffalo to skinless and fly-ridden hunks of meat, but as the days pass he is inured to the sight and smell of death. He also becomes more proficient as an outdoorsman and skinner. Though the valley floor is soon littered with the corpses of the beasts<ref name=":6" /> and the group collects many more hides than they can carry with them back to Butcher's Crossing, Miller becomes obsessed with killing every single buffalo, and he often kills as many as a hundred a day.<ref name=":5" /> Reveling in the slaughter, the men lose track of time.  Miller insists that the group remain in the valley until the entire herd is exterminated, but while blocking the escape of several small herds trying to leave the valley, a massive blizzard buries the valley in snow. Without time to build a more suitable shelter, the men nearly freeze to death and are forced to fashion crude sleeping bags out of raw buffalo hides. After several days of incessant snowfall, the expedition realizes that they are stranded until the snow melts and the pass becomes usable again–which means they will be waiting until the spring, very likely a duration of six to eight months. Throughout the winter, each man retreats into himself: Charlie ceases to do his job, Schneider talks only to himself, and Miller hunts and disappears into the forest for entire days. Eventually, the winter recedes and the group manages to recapture the oxen and horses which they had allowed to go wild over the winter, and loads up half the hides on the wagon, to return for the rest later in the year. The men manage to force the rickety load back over the pass and return to the plains, but soon come to a river swollen with the spring snowmelt. As Schneider and Charley Hoge cautiously lead the team across, a large log floats downriver, knocking Schneider's horse off its feet and spilling the precariously balanced wagon into the river. Schneider is killed when his flailing horse kicks him in the head and he drowns, and all of the hides are lost to the fast-moving waters.<ref name=":5" />   Devastated, Andrews, Miller, and Charley Hoge return to Butcher's Crossing, but find the town mostly deserted: the hotels and saloons are unused, entire buildings have disappeared, and the few faces occupying them are all different. McDonald, who had offered to buy their furs upon their return, no longer runs his business and the men later find him sleeping in an abandoned building. He tells them that his business was ruined when the market for buffalo hides fell through while they were gone, and that all of their work has been worthless. The railroad ended up being constructed fifty miles to the north of town, and Butcher's Crossing is dying. McDonald criticizes Andrews for not listening to him, but again offers him the chance to work with him back in Boston. Andrews again refuses. Miller spirals into depression,<ref name=":5" /> eventually burning McDonald's stockpiled buffalo hides and riding into the night, followed by Charley Hoge. Andrews begins a brief relationship with Francine before leaving her most of his money and riding away from town.<ref name=":5" />  
Comanche Moon
 In this bridge novel between McMurtry's ''[[Dead Man's Walk]]'' and ''[[Lonesome Dove]]'', Woodrow Call and Gus McCrae are in their middle years, still serving as respected [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]].  
The Crossing (McCarthy novel)
 Like its predecessor, ''[[All the Pretty Horses (novel)|All the Pretty Horses]]'' (1992), ''The Crossing'' is a [[Bildungsroman|coming-of-age novel]] set on the border between the southwest [[United States]] and [[Mexico]]. The plot takes place before and during the [[Second World War]] and focuses on the life of the [[protagonist]] Billy Parham, a [[teenage]] [[cowboy]]; his family; and his younger brother Boyd. The story tells of three journeys taken from [[New Mexico]] to Mexico. It is noted for being a more melancholic novel than the first of the trilogy, without returning to the hellish bleakness of McCarthy's early novels. <ref></ref>  Most of the protagonists are people of few words; thus the dialogues are few and concise. Additionally, since much of the interaction is with [[Mexican people]], many parts of dialogues are written in untranslated [[Mexican Spanish|Spanish]].  Although the novel is neither satirical nor humorous, its realistic portrayal of an often destitute hero taking part in a series of loosely connected quests in a brutal, corrupt world lends this book many of the qualities of a [[Picaresque novel|picaro]].  
Cities of the Plain (novel)
  The story opens in 1952. John Grady Cole  (the protagonist of ''[[All the Pretty Horses (novel)|All the Pretty Horses]]'') and Billy Parham (the protagonist of ''[[The Crossing (McCarthy novel)|The Crossing]]'') work together on a cattle ranch south of [[Alamogordo]], [[New Mexico]], not far from the border cities of [[El Paso]], Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez]] in the state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], Mexico. The ranch's owners are kind but face an uncertain future in a dying industry. Recently devastated by drought, cattle ranches around El Paso are struggling and may be claimed by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], through [[eminent domain]], to become military areas. Though the Cowboys barely make a living, John Grady and Billy love life on the [[open range]], and John Grady – as detailed in ''All the Pretty Horses'' – is a master at training horses. Billy is an excellent tracker.  During a visit to a brothel in Juárez, John Grady falls in love with a young, epileptic prostitute, Magdalena. The couple plans to marry and live in the U.S., and John Grady renovates an abandoned cabin, turning it into a home. But Magdalena's brothel is run by Eduardo, a formidable adversary also in love with the young girl. Billy attempts to dissuade John Grady but feels obligated to help the couple.  Eduardo's sidekick, Tiburcio, murders Magdalena by cutting her throat, after she steals away from the brothel to meet John Grady at a crossing of the [[Rio Grande]] and leave Mexico. After John Grady finds her body in the morgue, he faces Eduardo in a [[knife fight]] reminiscent of his prison showdown in ''All the Pretty Horses''. Though John Grady kills Eduardo, he is mortally wounded in the fight. He survives long enough to contact Billy, who hurries to comfort John Grady before his death.  After John Grady's death, a short epilogue—not unlike the conclusion of ''[[Blood Meridian]]'' (1985)—details, in a few pages, the next several decades of Billy's life. After drifting across the Southwest for many years, working ranches and living in hotels, Billy, homeless, takes shelter beneath a highway underpass. There, he meets a mysterious man who tells him about a convoluted dream. Though the man denies it, Billy suspects he is [[Death (personification)|Death]]. However, Billy survives the meeting with the man and finds shelter and a new life with a family who takes him in.  
Dead Man's Walk
 In 1842, young Texas Rangers [[Augustus McCrae]] and [[Woodrow Call]] are introduced quickly and brutally to the rangering life on their first expedition, in which they are stalked by the Comanche war chief [[Buffalo Hump]]. After a narrow escape, the rangers return to civilization, only to quickly join an expedition to capture and annex Santa Fe, part of [[New Mexico]] (the part east of the [[Rio Grande]]) for [[Texas]]. The expedition, led by pirate and soldier of fortune, Caleb Cobb, is ultimately a failure; of the 200 initial adventurers, only about 40 survive, falling to starvation, bears, and Indians, only to be swiftly arrested by the Mexican authorities. Those survivors are forced to march the [[Jornada del Muerto]] ("Dead Man's Walk") to [[El Paso]], and many, Mexican and Texan alike, die along the journey. The Texas contingent is reduced to ten persons when the captives panic after they observe cavalry drilling and are slaughtered in a blood lust as they flee. At their destination, the ten are forced to gamble for their lives by drawing a bean from a jar - a white bean signals life, a black bean death. Call and McCrae are among the five survivors. The last Rangers then return to Texas, escorting an Englishwoman and her son, who have also been held captive by the Mexicans.  
Destry Rides Again (novel)
 Harrison Destry, a man who thinks he is better than anyone else and is constantly "proving" it by his skill with a gun, and his ability to win fistfights he provokes, has just lost his horse and his saddle in a card game. (A cowboy who loses his saddle loses the respect of other cowboys.) He has few friends and many enemies (most of whom he created) in his home town of Wham, Texas. But the teenage Charlotte Dangerfield, the daughter of a wealthy rancher, adores him.  Only one of the men Destry has beaten in a fight, Chester Bent, seems to bear him no ill-will; Bent stakes the penniless Destry $100. But Bent has just robbed the Express, and (when the wind blows Destry's jacket open) slips cash from the robbery into Destry's pocket. Knowing Destry's character, Bent expects he will waste the money on liquor and gambling, rather than replacing his horse and saddle. This is indeed what happens, and Destry becomes the prime suspect, the planted cash being all but proof of his guilt.  Failing to comprehend how much trouble he is in, Destry neglects his defense and is stunned when convicted by a jury stacked with his enemies, who ignore the fact that the robber's description bears no relation whatever to Destry. He is sentenced to 10 years and swears to wreak vengeance on the jurors. Only Charlotte believes Destry is not guilty.  Released six years later for good behavior, Destry sets about systematically ruining the jurors' lives. He does not murder any of them, though he kills some in self-defense. Destry explains he is determined to stay within the law from now on (though some of his actions, such as trespassing and safe-cracking, are of dubious legality). His chief concern is to show that none of the "jury of his peers" is, in fact, his equal. Destry remains ignorant of Bent's role in framing him; Bent is one of the few people who treat Destry kindly, and Destry comes to count Bent as his best friend. But Bent is helping the remaining jurors organize to murder their nemesis. Anticipating a possible showdown with Destry, Bent has improved his shooting and fighting skills to the point where he is better than Destry.  While on the run, Destry meets Willie Thornton, a boy who has adopted Destry as his hero, based on the tall tales he has been told. Thornton later secretly observes Bent murdering a creditor. Bent uses Destry's knife to kill his victim, in order to frame Destry again. Bent then spots Willie and chases him; Willie escapes by diving into a raging river, from which he emerges weak and sick. Though running a fever, Willie steals a horse and makes a long, hard ride back to Wham to warn Destry of Bent's treachery. So warned, Destry fights his way out of a trap Bent has laid for him. The story's emotional climax occurs when Destry realizes Willie risked his life to save him and might very well die: <blockquote>...he felt a sudden scorn for the baser parts that were in him, the idler, the scoffer at others, the disdainful mocker at the labors of life. He wished to be simple, real, quiet, able to command the affection of his peers. ...for the first time he could realize the meaning of the word “peer”. Equal. For all men are equal. Not equal in strength of hand, in talent, in craft, in speed of foot or in leap of mind, but equal in mystery, in the identity of the race that breathes through all men, out of the soil, and out of the heavens. So it was that hatred for his enemies left him.</blockquote>  Wham's sheriff, Ding Slater, deputizes Destry, and Destry tries to arrest Bent. But Bent outdraws Destry and shoots Destry's Colt out of his hand; Destry is saved only by Slater's gunfire from the window. Bent flees, with Destry in pursuit. Overtaking Bent, Destry unmounts his enemy, but Bent overpowers Destry and leaps onto Destry's horse, making a last mad dash for freedom. In a most uncharacteristic climax for a Western, Destry shoots Bent in the back as the unarmed man flees. But Destry realizes the shot was lucky and proves nothing about his skill with a gun.  Returning to the devoted Charlotte Dangerfield, Destry announces he will lay down his guns forever, acknowledging that he found his peer in Bent.  
Cogewea
  The novel opens with a description of the frontier landscape before introducing Cogewea, a young Okanagan (spelled "Okanogan" in the novel) who is multiracial (with a white father and Okanagan mother). Her grandmother describes her as an impulsive and free-speaking young woman. A well-loved figure on her white brother-in-law's ranch, Cogewea is also well-educated in Okanagan folklore and values through her grandmother. But she feels a tension between her two cultures. Cogewea grapples with her western education through the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]].  One rancher, Silent Bob, tells a new rancher, Alfred Densmore, that Cogewea is heir to a large property and fortune, though she is not. Densmore tries to steal Cogewea’s property and money through seduction, proposing marriage. Cogewea's grandmother attempts to use storytelling and Okanagan traditions to convince Cogewea that Densmore will take advantage of her. After a period of indecision, Cogewea refuses Densmore's proposal. He ends up taking Cogewea captive, but after he realizes that she has little financial worth, he leaves her to die in the wilderness.  In the end, a rancher named Jim rescues Cogewea. In a twist of fate, Cogewea does end up with wealth, inheriting part of her white father’s fortune. She then realizes her feelings for Jim and marries him.  ===Major characters=== '''Cogewea''': the eponymous main character is a young woman who has a love for nature and is a skilled horse rider. She is headstrong but charming and loved by many at the HB Ranch. Like most members of the ranch, her heritage is Indigenous and Euro-American.  '''James 'Jim' Lagrinder''': The multi-racial foreman of the HB Ranch is described as "the best rider on the Flathead". He listens to Cogewea, and while she considers him to be family, and he calls her "sis", he hopes he can kindle a romance with her.  '''Stemteema''': Cogewea's grandmother, who raised Cogewea and her sisters, Mary and Julia. She does not trust the Shoyapee (her term for white people, which loosely translated compares the "white man" to a "the hog because of his greedy nature").<ref>Lucullus McWhorter, ed.''Cogewea (1927)'' by Mourning Dove. University of Nebraska Press, 1981. 289.</ref><ref name=":5" /> She tells a series of stories to Cogewea, warning her of impending danger after Cogewea falls in love with the antagonist, Alfred Densmore. Each of her warnings come true.  '''Alfred Densmore''': The greenhorn easterner (a stock western character) whom Cogewea hires. He is told by Silent Bob (as a prank) that Cogewea possesses a fortune in land and capital, which is not true. He then devises a plan to seduce Cogewea and steal her money.  '''Mary''': Cogewea's sister who is quiet but also distrusts white culture. She ends up marrying Frenchy, who is a European but respects Indigenous culture and identity.  '''Julia''': Cogewea's sister who has married a white man who owns the HB Ranch. She has assimilated into white culture.  '''Silent Bob''': A comical prankster cowboy (a stock character in the [[Dime Western]]). He may be a parody of Owen Wister's taciturn eponymous hero in [[The Virginian (novel)]]. Bob tells Densmore that Cogewea has money and land, leaving her vulnerable to Denmore's machinations. However, Bob breaks from his stock mold to tell Cogewea the truth about Densmore.  '''Frenchy''': A seemingly minor character who marries into Cogewea's family.  
Fire on the Mountain (Abbey novel)
  Abbey includes the following paragraph to introduce this book:    The hero of the story is John Vogelin, a [[New Mexico]] rancher whose land is about to be condemned by the [[United States Air Force]], who want to use his land to expand a bombing range.  He is the last holdout among the several people whose land the Air Force wants, and he refuses to move.  The story of his resistance to being thrown off his land and his death is told through the eyes of his grandson, who is visiting the ranch for the summer.<ref name="Abbey1962"></ref>  
Ghost Warrior
 The Chiricahua Apache chief, [[Victorio]], called his sister [[Lozen]] his wise counselor and his right hand. He said she had the strength of a man and was a shield to her people. Even in a society possessing extraordinary courage, endurance and skill, she was unique. The Apaches believe that when she was young, the spirits blessed her with horse magic, the gift of healing and the power to see enemies at a distance. In the Apaches' 30-year struggle to defend their homeland, they came to rely on her strength, wisdom, and supernatural abilities.  Because of her gift of far-sight, she was the only unmarried woman allowed to ride with the warriors and fight alongside them. After her beloved brother Victorio's death, she joined [[Geronimo]]'s band of insurgents. With Geronimo and fifteen other warriors, she resisted the combined forces of the United States and Mexican armies, and the heavily armed civilian populations of New Mexico and Arizona Territories. She and the sixteen warriors, and seventeen women and children held out against a total of about nine thousand men.  
Fearless, A Novel of Sarah Bowman
  In 1845, Mexico would not relinquish its claim to Texas, and the U.S. prepared for war.  Under the command of General Zachary "Old Rough and Ready" Taylor, Sarah signed on as a laundress and cook and bivouacked with Taylor's army in Corpus Christi, preparing for an attack by Mexico.  Before the war even began, though, her husband was killed.  But going home was out of the question.  She considered the army her home and its soldiers her family.  Nowhere else would her courage and compassion be so much needed and appreciated.  While the battle raged around her, Sarah became a familiar figure through the haze of sulfurous blue smoke and the stench of exploding gunpowder, riding among the flames to retrieve the wounded.  Through the long years of bitter battle, she would find love in the arms of a sergeant with eyes as golden as a flame, and friendship in the company of Cruz, a Mexican woman whose personal history encompassed the war in all its passions and horrors.

Chantry's wife and son are dead, burned to death in the fire that consumed his home, for which he is blamed. He takes with him a [[Ferguson Rifle]], given to him by Major Ferguson himself. He meets up with an outfit of trappers after crossing the Mississippi River.  Although never stated directly, Chantry quickly becomes the leader of the group. Main members of the group are an Irishman, Davy Shanagan, and Solomon, who by the end of the book is revealed to be very well known throughout the wilderness. Early on the outfit's journey west, they encounter the [[Spain|Spanish]] Captain Fernandez accompanied by [[Ute tribe|Ute Indians]]. The Captain attempts to arrest the outfit for trespassing on Spanish colonies. The outfit informs him that the land was bought under the [[Louisiana Purchase]].  That night it is believed that Captain Fernandez attacks them but fails with two Utes being killed. The outfit presses on. Another night Chantry hears gunshots ring out in the distance after being awakened by a wolf who was trying to steal bacon. The next morning Chantry discovers the dead body of a man in a [[Mexico|Mexican]] uniform. He searches the body and recovers a medallion. Chantry and Walks-by-Night back-track him and come to the realization that he was with a woman and boy and they had been chased and he had been killed. Chantry goes off by himself and encounters the girl and the boy.  
Forlorn River
 Ben Ide spends his time chasing wild horses in Northern California, accompanied by the wanderer, Nevada and his Indian companion, Modoc.

She defends Ben against the suspicions of her newly-rich father and his mysterious associate, Les Setter, who has a previous connection to Nevada.  Looking toward the future, Ben Ide and his companions buy out a couple of ranchers in a severe drought and proceed to catch a lot of wild horses.  He is after one in particular- California Red, whom Ina's father has promised as a present for her, if any man should catch him.  Setter and Blaine set out to steal Ben's new land while he's off, and trouble follows.  
Fair Land, Fair Land
  ''Fair Land, Fair Land'' begins where ''The Way West'' ends, with Dick Summers riding away from the group of "wagon-train people" he has guided from Independence to Oregon, but Summers leaves without saying goodbye and while the settlers are still sleeping.  As a mountain man traveling light, all Summers carries is his Hawken rifle, "his old Green River knife, some ammunition and a small sack of possibles."<ref>''Fair Land, Fair Land'', Chapter 1.</ref>  As he rides Summers remembers the events of ''The Big Sky'' of about fifteen years before when he was the hunter for a French trading expedition traveling up the Missouri in a keelboat to Blackfeet country, a trip that ended with the Blackfeet killing all the Frenchmen and only the three friends, Summers, Boone Caudill, and Jim Deakins, escaping.<ref>''Chapter 1.</ref>  Summers meets and shares a jug with a man who mentions having encountered Boone Caudill, "The broodiest bastard I ever see.

Summers meets Teal Eye again, becomes her mate, and adopts her blind son, who in Indian fashion has been given a descriptive name, "Nocansee."  Summers and Teal Eye have another son, Lije, and are ultimately able to have a white marriage ceremony, conducted by their friend Brother Potter.<ref>Chapters 13 to 18</ref> Nocansee was a red-headed baby, but was the natural son of Boone Caudill, who years before had killed his red-headed best friend, Jim Deakins, because Caudill wrongly thought Teal Eye had cheated on him with Deakins.<ref>See [[The Big Sky (novel)|''The Big Sky'']].</ref>  Dick Summers and Teal Eye arrange for Hig to marry a Shoshone chief's granddaughter, Little Wing, and the ceremony is performed by Summers.<ref>Chapters 22 to 24</ref>  The years pass.

When Summers meets Caudill on the trail and confronts him with the facts that Caudill unjustly killed his best friend, Caudill leaps on Summers and attempts to strangle him.  Although he has his knife in his hand and will die if Caudill continues the throttling, Summers cannot bring himself to stab.  He is losing consciousness when he hears a shot—Hig has killed Caudill and afterward says, "He didn't mean nothin' to me."<ref>Chapters 25 to 26</ref>  A.B. Guthrie writes of the white destruction of the Eden of Montana.  For example, greedy white men discover gold in Alder Gulch, resulting in despoiling of the area, corruption, and violence.<ref>Chapters 28 to 31</ref>  Or, one afternoon Dick Summers hears a shot and discovers that a boy has gut-shot Summers's best horse, thinking he was shooting an elk or a deer.  The horse is suffering, but having caused so much damage the foolish but sorry boy cannot bring himself to complete the job—"I couldn't ... not a horse."  Summers is forced to shoot the horse.<ref>Chapter 35</ref>  Higgins and Little Wing leave Summers and Teal Eye to return to Little Wing's Shoshone people.<ref>Chapter 34</ref> Dick Summers, Teal Eye, and Nocansee are living in the village of the Blackfoot chief Heavy Runner when the Indian agency orders all the Blackfeet chiefs to a meeting because of Indian horse stealing and a recent Indian killing of a white man.  Heavy Runner asks Dick Summers to go with him to speak for the Indians.<ref>Chapter 36</ref>  Running the meeting are two men:  General Sully, the superintendent of Indian Affairs, and U.S. Marshal Wheeler.  The only Blackfeet to have shown up are peaceful ones, and the band that committed the worst crimes, including the recent murder, doesn't appear.  Summers is surprised to find his son Lije standing behind Sully and Wheeler, ill-at-ease as part of the Army and as their interpreter. The fruitless meeting concludes with General Sully telling the chiefs that they must surrender the killers of the white man and return the stolen stock.<ref>Chapter 37</ref>  After the Army's time limit has passed with no surrender of murderers and no return of stock, officers plan "A secret mission, a stealing out to kill Blackfeet, a surprise attack." The meeting, at which Lije is deliberately degraded to be a servant pouring whiskey, is conducted by Major Baker, perhaps the most overtly evil person in the novel:  "This time we show them that we mean business.  No prisoners ... I swear this is the last time, so bear with me, gentlemen."  As Major Baker plans the slaughter of the Blackfeet he acknowledges that in the dawn attack on the villages the January weather will be cold, but "Think of that other enemy, the Blackfeet, all huddled in camp against the cold. ... Sitting ducks."  Lije calls him a fool for attacking such chiefs as Heavy Runner, who is friendly and "has a friendship paper" from the government. Major Baker has Lije put in the guardhouse, where, after having thought over his life, Lije reaches between the bars and breaks a window, the implication being that he is getting the glass in order to commit suicide.<ref>Chapter 38</ref>  In the morning several days later, Dick Summers wakes up to someone shouting "Wrong camp" and from the flap of his tepee sees Heavy Runner trot out of his lodge "waving his friendship paper" and be immediately shot down.  Summers makes Teal Eye escape through a hole in the rear of their tepee and then sits to await his fate.  A soldier looks in and remarks that Summers is a white man.  The soldier also sees the nonwhite Nocansee sitting quietly.  When Summers tells him that Nocansee is blind, the soldier responds that then he need not waste a bullet and clubs Nocansee to death with the butt of his carbine.  Summers shoots the soldier in the forehead with his Hawken, the rifle he has carried and relied upon throughout the trilogy.  Two more soldiers come in and shoot Summers as "a turncoat son of a bitch" who "Killed his own kind."  The novel ends with Summers drifting into unconsciousness and death, hearing the sounds of the soldiers destroying the village and "the wailing of squaws and the crying of children and the voices of soldiers proud of themselves."<ref>Chapter 39.</ref>  
The Ghosts of Watt O'Hugh
  From the ''[[Boston Phoenix]]'':  ''The title hero  -- a Western legend, [[American Civil War|Civil War]] Veteran, and Wild West Show star -- has, like [[Billy Pilgrim]] in [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Slaughterhouse Five]]'' become unstuck in time.  Also like Pilgrim, who was forever traumatized by the Allied bombing of Dresden during World War II, at the heart of Watt's chronological peregrinations is a tragic historical event, in his case the 1863 New York City [[Draft Riots]] during which uncounted African-Americans were lynched.  ''Love also plays a major part in Watt's tale: he's lost his heart to Lucy Billings, a beautiful firebrand and fighter for justice who unfortunately has taken up with someone whose revolutionary commitment is greater than his own. But there are other amorous solaces with which he passes the time, or times; like Emelina, a bawdy barmaid and apparently immortal revenant.  ''So you could say there's a lot going on in this teeming tome, including cameos by [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[J.P. Morgan]], the latter of whom is responsible for one of Watt's grimmer misadventures when he has the redoubtable cowpoke tossed into the [[Wyoming Territorial Prison]] in [[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]] on a bogus murder charge.''  
Dust of the Damned
  ''Dust of the Damned'' is about fugitive werewolves who were released from prison by [[Abraham Lincoln]] to help him fight the [[American Civil War]] on the condition that after the war they would return to Eastern Europe but they did not keep their promise and headed to the [[American West]]. Zane and Coffin's job is to hunt them down.  
Horseman, Pass By
  Seventeen-year-old Lonnie lives on a Texas [[ranch]] with his grandfather Homer Bannon, Homer's wife Jewel, and her adult son Hud. While a good [[cowboy]], Hud does whatever he wants, regardless of others. They also have a new worker, Jesse, and a cook Halmea, a nicer African-American woman who is treated nicely by Homer. Hud is very nasty towards her, and Lonnie tries to be nice to her.  In the prologue it briefly explains the life on the ranch, a little bit of backstories of everyone there's lives.  One day one of Homer's young [[Cow|heifers]] dies suddenly, and first one vet, then another is called. The dead animal is found to have [[foot and mouth disease]], and it is communicated to the rest of the herd. All [[cattle]] on the ranch are led into a hole dug by bulldozers shot and their bodies buried deeply.  During this time, Hud [[rape]]s the cook, Halmea, causing her to leave. Lonnie and Halmea shoot at him but miss. Halmea tried to kill him but Lonnie just wanted to scare him to no avail. Lonnie goes to the town rodeo, only to see one of his friend Hermy get seriously hurt in a [[bull riding]] accident when a bull stomps on and shatters his chest. Lonnie heads back to the ranch, as Hud also returns from another direction.   Homer is found sick on the side of the highway, and has bones sticking out of his chest due to falling off a porch and is found by Hud and Lonnie. Hud sends Lonnie for help, and any help he can find runs away in fear, Hud shoots Homer while he is gone. Lonnie is very upset by this but Hud says it's the best thing he could do due to the physical pain he was in and would most likely never fully recover. The book ends with Homer's funeral, when they ask Lonnie to go with them to bury him he gets upset and runs to the back of the church with the song book, "think of the horseman that had passed."   An epilogue is quickly narrated by Lonnie and he briefly explains how he left Homer's funeral to see the injured friend, Hermy who's ribs were shattered when a bull stomped on them. He hitches a ride by a very nice truck driver who knew Homer, when he asks how he was doing all Lonnie says is, "Mean as ever". The driver explains numerous stories about bulls, his wife, and his kids. Lonnie explains to the reader how he reminded him of everyone he knew.  The book despite being less popular than most McMurtry books is praised and many compare it to [[Thomas Wolfe]] and it's compared to [[J. D. Salinger]]'s 1951 classic [[The Catcher in the Rye]].  
Haunted Mesa
 Mike Raglan, a roughly middle-aged man who specializes in [[paranormal investigation]]s (and normally debunking the phenomena) has received urgent phone calls and mail from an old friend of his, Erik Hokart. Hokart was an independently wealthy scientist, inventor, and businessman who made his fortune in electronics. He was investigating an odd patch of mountainous country in the Southwest, intending to build a secluded home on top of one particular mesa around which rumors had long swirled. His messages to Mike intimated that he was in deep trouble and desperately needed someone of his talents.  Hokart doesn't show up at the designated meeting spot, but the next day Mike receives a package from him, delivered by an exotic female beauty. A man breaks into his room to try to steal the package, and is only finally sent off with a book Raglan wrote by a lie and a [[.357 Magnum]].  The package contains Erik Hokart's journal of his quasi-archaeological expedition. The first night on the chosen mesa, glowing lines appear on the blueprint, of a [[kiva]] (a room used for religious rituals) attached to the ruins of the house Hokart was using as a makeshift shelter. Hokart is a little perturbed when the glowing lines turn out to be correct, and he begins to excavate the underground kiva even though it looks to have been deliberately buried. It creeps out both him and his large guard dog, "Chief".  Fully excavated, the kiva reveals itself as anomalous in having no [[sipapu]] but rather a [[blind window]] made out of a curious gray substance. After he finishes, Hokart discovers that a pencil of his had been stolen and replaced with a jar. Afraid, Hokart begins to leave; Chief mistakes his abrupt movements for an intention to attack the kiva and plunges through the window and into a far invisible distance through to somewhere else. Erik begins to consider the legends and beliefs of the [[Hopi]]: they say their people originally came from the Third World, which was evil, and so they climbed up into a kiva in this, the Fourth World, to escape it; the obvious speculation is that a malign power of the Third World was sealed by the burial of the kiva and that it wants the window to this world opened back up.  Erik rests. His pencil is returned the next day, worn down to a nub. He resharpens it and sets out more. They too vanish, as well as one of his [[cardigan sweater]]s. The sweater returns with a newly made twin. Two days later, Chief returns, apparently none the worse for wear.  Having read thus far in Hokart's journal, Mike prepares to travel to the mesa, to personally investigate. He pauses to read further. As Hokart resolved to leave now that his dog had been returned, he is confronted by a striking raven-haired ivory-skinned woman who imperiously orders him to accompany her back through the portal in the kiva. He refuses, struck by a sense of menace and evil radiating from her, and leaves immediately. On the way down, he meets a young girl named Kawasi, who explains that she is a renegade from the Third World and that the woman was a "Poison Woman" who intended to imprison or kill him. They escape, and stop at a restaurant for dinner. He instructs Kawasi to get his journal to Mike, when the restaurant is surrounded by hired thugs. The journal ends with Erik making a break for the [[jeep]] and ordering Kawasi out the back.  Mike discovers that the restaurant concerned had been destroyed that night in an abrupt and inexplicable fire. He finds Kawasi waiting for him in another nearby restaurant. She tells him, that night ended in Hokart's kidnapping. They are approached by the local constable, Gallagher. They forthrightly answer his questions and tell him the tale up to that point. Gallagher doesn't quite believe them, but he maintains an open mind.  Raglan determines to go into the Third World (named [[Shibalba]] by its inhabitants, who suffer under the decaying and decadent [[totalitarian regime]] of "The Hand" and his Lords of Shibalba) to rescue Hokart; the kiva entrance is surely guarded now, so he intends to use a map to Shibalba he was given by an old cowboy who had stolen gold from, and barely escaped alive, the Third World. On his way, he meets "Tazzoc", a historian/archivist of Shibalba's forgotten archives, who tells Raglan much about Shibalba and its rulers; he wants to dissuade Raglan from his quest because it is hopeless and could only lead to trouble.  At the designated place, Raglan is frightened off by the presence of a squad of investigating Shibalban soldiers, "the Varanel, the Night Guards of Shibalba". Raglan confers with Gallagher and Tazzoc again, who promises to leave some native clothes at the kiva entrance so Raglan can better blend in; Raglan promises to do what he could to save Tazzoc's archives and get them into wider circulation. A confrontation with a local agent of the Hand, Eden Foster, only ends up as a brawl which Raglan wins.  He enters the Third World, enlisting the aid of Johnny (an old cowboy who had been trapped in the Third World for decades) as backup. Raglan rendezvouses with Tazzoc in his archives, located within the mazy trap-filled citadel the Hand lives in and where Hokart is presumably being held, the Forbidden. The archives hold an ancient map from when the Forbidden was first built, and with its aid he finds Hokart's cell - although he is hunted through the Forbidden by the ambitious and arrogant agent [[Zipacna]] and his Varanel goons. Raglan's pistols win through the Varanel and rescue the starving Hokart. They break out, and Johnny discourages pursuit with his big rifle laying down [[covering fire]] on the pursuing Varanel.  A day later, as the portal back to the Fourth World quavers and begins to collapse, they meet Volkmeer,  an old friend Raglan had left to guard the kiva who has entered the employ of the Hand, and attempt to escape the Third World.  Raglan, Hokart, and the others escape, but Volkmeer is caught in the portal as it becomes quiescent, and is killed.  
Holmes on the Range
 In 1892, cowboy Gustav "Old Red" Amlingmeyer is read a [[Sherlock Holmes]] story "[[The Red-Headed League]]" by his younger brother Otto "Big Red" Amlingmeyer while on a cattle drive and decides to follow in his new hero's footsteps, by using logic and observation to solve mysteries.  Unfortunately for him, cowboys do not often stumble on to mysteries and he practices his craft until the pair are hired by a ranch to perform maintenance.  When the general manager of the ranch shows up dead after a stampede and everyone believes it an accident despite some suspicious circumstances, Old Red uses his new skills to see that there is more to it than what appears.  As the mystery gets deeper and the bodies start to mount, the brothers learn that there is more to solving crimes then simply following the clues - there are also bullets to dodge.  
The Hawkline Monster: A Gothic Western
 Taking place mainly in eastern [[Oregon]] in 1902, the story concerns a pair of morally ambivalent gunmen, Cameron and Greer. On a job in Hawaii, they are stopped by the fact their target is with his son. After returning to California they spend some time in a brothel, where a young [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]-looking woman, Magic Child, comes to hire them for a job at her house. Along the way they stop at a place to eat and during the meal hear loud gunshot-like noises. That night Magic Child sleeps with both men and Greer takes quite a liking to her.  When they reach the house, in the middle of the western plains, it is surrounded by snow. Miss Hawkline comes to greet them and they realize that Magic Child is her twin sister. As soon as they enter the house the women's personalities change and they explain that they brought the men here to hunt down and destroy the "monster" living in the "ice caves" beneath the house. Miss Hawkline and her sister (also called "Miss Hawkline") believe that the monster has killed their father, a [[Harvard University|Harvard]] scientist who disappeared while hard at work in his basement laboratory on a project referred to only as "The Chemicals," which would, he claimed, if perfected, be a great boon to the human race. During the conversation the four characters realize that The Chemicals are somehow altering their minds to make them lose track of what they are discussing. Then, the large family butler suddenly dies, and shrinks into a little person.  As the story unfolds, it becomes apparent that the monster is not a physical being; rather it is a prank created by The Chemicals, which manifest themselves as a "light" that flies mischievously around the house. After all the strange happenings, evidently designed to distract them, Cameron pours a glass of whiskey into the beaker containing The Chemicals. This kills the monster, destroys the house and turns the father back into a human being (he had been an umbrella basket the whole time). The butler returns to normal size and comes back to life. Cameron and Greer marry the two sisters, and the story ends, but an epilogue states that the sisters eventually divorced the two men.  
Lonesome Dove
 It is the late 1870s.<ref>The 1876 [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]] has already occurred; chapter 93.</ref> Captain Woodrow F. Call and Captain Augustus "Gus" McCrae, two famous retired [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], run the Hat Creek Cattle Company and Livery Emporium in the small Texas border town of Lonesome Dove. Working with them are Joshua Deets, an excellent black tracker and scout from their Ranger days; Pea Eye Parker, another former Ranger who is reliable but unintelligent; Bolivar, a retired Mexican bandit who works as their cook; and Newt Dobbs, a 17-year-old boy whose mother was a prostitute named Maggie and whose father is widely thought by the outfit to be Call, though Call has never acknowledged this.  Jake Spoon, another former Ranger, arrives in Lonesome Dove after an absence of more than 10 years, during which he has travelled widely across the United States. He is on the run, having accidentally shot a dentist in [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]]. The dentist's brother happens to be the sheriff, July Johnson.   Reunited with Gus and Call, Jake's description of [[Montana Territory|Montana]] inspires Call to gather a herd of cattle and drive them north to begin the first cattle ranch north of the [[Yellowstone River]]. Call, who has grown listless in retirement, is attracted to the romantic notion of settling pristine country. Gus is less enthusiastic but changes his mind when reminded that the love of his life, Clara, lives on the [[Platte River]] near [[Ogallala, Nebraska]], which would be on the route to Montana. The Hat Creek outfit rustles cattle from across the border in Mexico and recruits local cowboys in preparation for the drive.  Ironically, Jake Spoon decides not to go at all, having made himself comfortable with the town's only prostitute, Lorena Wood, who is smitten with him after he promises to take her to [[San Francisco]]. At Lorena's insistence, however, she and Jake ultimately trail along behind the cattle drive.  In Fort Smith, the sheriff July Johnson has departed town on the trail of Jake Spoon, taking his 12-year-old stepson Joe with him. July's wife Elmira, who regrets her recent marriage to him, leaves shortly afterwards to search for her former lover Dee Boot. Inept deputy sheriff Roscoe Brown is sent after July to inform him of her disappearance, and has many misadventures and strange encounters through Arkansas and Texas, assisted by a young girl named Janey who escapes from [[sexual slavery]] to accompany him. Roscoe eventually reunites with July and Joe when they rescue him and Janey from bandits in Texas.  As the cattle drive moves north through Texas, Jake tires of Lorena and abandons her to go gambling in Austin. Left alone, she is abducted by an Indian bandit named Blue Duck, an old nemesis of the Texas Rangers'. Gus goes in pursuit, and while travelling along the [[Canadian River]] he encounters July's group. Gus and July attack Blue Duck's bandit encampment, killing the bandits and rescuing Lorena; however, Blue Duck has already made his escape, having murdered Roscoe, Joe, and Janey in the process.   A devastated July continues his journey in search of Elmira, while Gus and Lorena return to the cattle drive. Lorena has been repeatedly raped and, suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], is frightened of interacting with anybody other than Gus. The two of them, still following the cattle drive north, sleep in a tent some distance behind the other cowboys.  Meanwhile, Jake Spoon is in Fort Worth. Hearing that July Johnson has been looking for him, Jake  leaves Texas in a hurry in the company of the Suggs brothers, whom he soon realizes are bandits. Jake becomes increasingly alarmed by the brothers' actions as they travel north into Kansas; the gang progresses from robbery to outright murder, but Jake is too frightened and outnumbered to either kill them or escape.   When the gang attacks a trail boss known to Gus and Call, the former Rangers of the Hat Creek outfit go in pursuit of them. The ex-Rangers are dismayed when they apprehend the Suggs brothers and find Jake alongside them. Jake pleads with his former comrades that he had no choice but to go along with things for fear of his own life, but Gus and Call stand firm that he has "crossed a line," and they solemnly hang him alongside the Suggs brothers. Newt, who had idolized Jake as a child, is left deeply upset.  Meanwhile, Elmira, pregnant with July's child, has come into the company of a rough buffalo hunter named Zwey, a simple man who seems to believe he is now "married" to her. Arriving in Nebraska they come across the horse ranch of Clara Allen, Gus's former love, whose husband Bob has become a brain-damaged invalid after being kicked by a [[mustang]]. Clara delivers Elmira's baby son, but Elmira and Zwey leave almost immediately afterwards for Ogallala.   Dee Boot is held in the Ogallala jail, scheduled to be hanged for his accidental murder of a settler; Elmira collapses while speaking to him, and Boot is hanged while she recuperates in a doctor's house, leaving her heartbroken and depressed. July arrives at Clara's ranch, learns what has transpired, and goes to see her, but Elmira refuses to speak to him. Shortly afterwards she orders Zwey to take her east, back towards [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].   July feels compelled to follow her, but at Clara's insistence he remains at the ranch with her family and his son instead, anguished and heartbroken. Word later reaches them that Elmira and Zwey were killed by [[Sioux]].  The Hat Creek outfit arrives in Nebraska, and Gus takes Lorena, Call, and Newt to visit Clara. She is happy to see him but has no desire to rekindle their romance; however, she takes in Lorena, whose PTSD is easing and who feels comfortable with Clara and her daughters. Gus, rebuffed by Clara and no longer Lorena's sole carer, decides to go with the cattle drive and see the journey to Montana through to its end.  In [[Wyoming Territory|Wyoming]], several horses are stolen by half-starved Indians. Call, Gus, and Deets chase after them, and Deets is killed in the ensuing confrontation by the group's only remaining brave. Shortly afterwards Gus informs Newt that Call is his father, something Newt has always dreamed of, but he is too upset by Deets' death to give it much thought.  The cattle drive arrives in Montana, which is as lush and beautiful as Jake had described. Scouting ahead of the main herd, Gus and Pea Eye are attacked by [[Blood Indians]], and Gus is badly wounded by two arrows to the leg. Besieged in a makeshift dugout in the bank of the [[Musselshell River]] for several days, Gus' wounds become infected, and his health declines. After a heavy rain he sends Pea Eye down the swollen river to seek help, but Pea Eye loses his clothing in the river and stumbles naked across the plains. Starving, delirious and suffering from exposure, he returns to the main herd on the verge of death. Call then sets out alone to rescue Gus.  Meanwhile, Gus leaves the river shortly after Pea Eye, feverish and dying, taking his chances and escaping the Indians. He makes it to [[Miles City, Montana,]] and collapses unconscious, waking to find that a doctor has sawed off his [[gangrene|gangrenous]] leg. His other leg is also infected, but Gus refuses to let the doctor amputate it. Call arrives in Miles City and fruitlessly tries to convince Gus to have his other leg removed; Gus, however, would rather die than be an invalid. Gus asks Call to bury him by the spring in Texas where he used to picnic with Clara, and Call begrudgingly agrees. After writing letters to Clara and Lorena, and urging Call to accept Newt as his son, Gus dies of [[blood poisoning]].  Call leaves Gus' body in storage in Miles City, intending to return him to Texas after the winter. He continues north with the cattle drive, despondent over losing his closest friend.   Eventually, he establishes a ranch between the [[Missouri River]] and the [[Milk River (Alberta–Montana)|Milk River]]. Call suffers from depression all winter, no longer caring about the cattle drive or the ranch, and contemplating what to do about Newt. Before leaving in the spring, he puts Newt in charge of the ranch and gives him his horse, his rifle, and his family watch, but still cannot bring himself to claim the boy as his son. Newt is inwardly upset but accepts the gifts nonetheless. Call, ashamed of himself, leaves the ranch.  Call retrieves Gus' body, packed in a coffin with salt and charcoal, and begins the long journey south. In Nebraska, he gives Gus' letters to Clara and Lorena. Clara considers the journey a whimsical folly typical of Gus and urges Call to bury him on her ranch, but Call refuses, having given Gus his word. Clara tells Call she despises him as a "vain coward" for refusing to claim Newt as his son,<ref>Chapter 101.</ref> and he leaves Nebraska haunted by her condemnation.<ref>"He found that he could not easily forget a word Clara said... her words stinging in his heart and head," chapter 102.</ref>  The story of the cowboy transporting his dead friend's body spreads across the plains, and Call takes a circuitous route through [[Colorado]] and [[New Mexico]] to avoid the increasing attention. In [[Santa Rosa, New Mexico]], he discovers that Blue Duck has been captured by a sheriff's deputy. Call visits Blue Duck in his jail cell, and the Indian taunts him, pointing out that he raided, killed, raped, and kidnapped with impunity throughout his life despite the best efforts of the Texas Rangers. On the day of his hanging, Blue Duck tackles the sheriff's deputy who caught him through an upper-story courthouse window, killing them both.  Arriving back in Texas exhausted and despondent, Call buries Gus by the spring in San Antonio, true to his word. He then rides on to Lonesome Dove, where the cook Bolivar, who had abandoned the cattle drive before it left Texas, is delighted to see him again. In town, Call finds that the saloon has burned down; the proprietor was in love with Lorena and committed suicide after her departure.  
Last of the Duanes (novel)
 Buck Duane is the son of a famous Texas gunman, a fact which brings him almost nothing but trouble.  Duane shoots a man who threatens him and flees the law.  He mixes with outlaws while clinging desperately to the last of his principles.  He rescues a girl named Jennie from the hands of an outlaw king, but loses her in the escape.  He then wanders aimlessly, desperation growing as the worth of life slips away.  
The Lone Star Ranger
 Buck Duane is the son of a famous outlaw. Though an outlaw is not always a criminal, if the Rangers say he is an outlaw, it's just as bad – he's a hunted man. After killing a man in self-defense, Duane is forced to 'go on the dodge'. Duane turns up at an outlaw's hideout, still revolting at the idea of outlawry. Worse still, all the men he kills haunt him, for years.  At the outlaw hideout, he meets a kidnapped, beautiful young woman and desires to see her free.  In the second part of the book, Duane joins the Rangers, who want him to help to clear the frontier of major cattle rustlers and bank robbers, in return for the governor's pardon of his illegal deeds.  
Little Big Man (novel)
 The novel is structured as a recorded narrative of the purported exploits of 121-year-old Jack Crabb, a white male child raised by the [[Cheyenne]] nation, as he describes his wanderings across the nineteenth-century American West to Ralph Fielding Snell, a somewhat gullible "Man of Letters."  Though unknown to conventional history, Crabb has supposedly crossed paths with many of the West's notable figures, including [[Wild Bill Hickok]], [[Wyatt Earp]], [[Buffalo Bill]], and [[George Armstrong Custer]].  At various times captured, rescued, escaped, and returned to or from both white and Native American societies of the time, Crabb also claims to be the "sole white survivor" of the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]].  
The Last Tycoon
 Set in the 1930s, ''The Last Tycoon'' traces the life of [[Hollywood]] studio manager Monroe Stahr, clearly based on [[Irving Thalberg]] (head of the film company [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]), whom Fitzgerald had encountered several times.  The novel begins with young NYC college student Cecelia Brady (first-person narrator), the daughter of influential Hollywood producer Pat Brady aka [[Louis B. Mayer]] preparing to fly home to Los Angeles. At the airport, she is surprised to meet an old friend of her father, author Wylie White. White is accompanied by a failed producer introduced as Mr. Schwartz. Due to complications during the flight, they make a forced landing in Nashville, Tennessee. The threesome decide for a spontaneous trip to the historic estate of former President Andrew Jackson, but on arrival the attraction is closed. Wylie then proceeds to flirt shamelessly with Cecelia while Mr. Schwartz is fast asleep. When Schwartz awakens, he informs them that he has changed his mind and will not travel to Los Angeles with them. He asks Wylie to deliver a message to a friend, which he gladly accepts. The next day, Wylie and Cecelia learn that Schwartz committed suicide right after they left Nashville.  Cecelia realises that the message Schwarz gave to Wylie was in fact for Monroe Stahr, her father's business partner. She has had a crush on Monroe for many years. Cecelia arrives at her father's film studio to pick him up for a birthday party. Due to an unexpected minor earthquake, Cecelia, her father, and his companions all end up in Stahr's office. A water pipe bursts and floods the set. Stahr beholds two women desperately clinging to the head of a statue – finding one of them to be the spitting image of his late wife. The day after, Stahr asks his secretary to identify the girls for him. She presents him with a phone number which he immediately uses to arrange a meeting with one of the girls. Unfortunately, it is not the girl he wished to see, she does not resemble his wife at all. Stahr gives her a ride home, where she insists that he'd come in and meet her friend (the young Irish-born Kathleen Moore). As soon as Moore opens the front door, Stahr recognises her to be the woman he had seen the other night.  Kathleen withstands his advances to her and even refuses to tell him her name. It is only when Stahr happens to meet her again at a party that he can convince her to go out and have a cup of coffee with him. He drives her to the building site of his new house in Santa Monica. Kathleen seems reluctant to be with Stahr, but she still ends up having sex with him. A short time afterwards, Stahr receives a letter in which Kathleen confesses to have been engaged to another man for quite some time. She has now decided to marry him despite having fallen in love with Stahr.  Stahr asks Cecelia to arrange for a meeting with a suspected communist who wants to organise a labour union within the film studio. Stahr and Cecelia meet the man over supper where Stahr gets drunk and gets involved in a violent confrontation. Cecelia takes care of him and they grow closer. Cecelia's father, however, becomes more and more unhappy with Stahr as a business partner and has wanted to get rid of him for a long while. He could not approve less of his daughter's fancying him. Brady knows of Stahr's continued affair with the now-married Kathleen and tries to blackmail him into leaving the company. As he fails to achieve his goal via blackmail, he does not even shy away from hiring a professional killer. Stahr survives, and, in retaliation, also appoints a man to have Brady killed. Unlike Brady's, Stahr's conscience starts to trouble in. But, just as he contemplates calling the execution off, his plane crashes on its way back to New York City. The contract killer finishes his job unhindered and leaves Cecelia both without a father and without a lover – the two men who meant the world to her.  
The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon
 Duivichi-un-Dua, also known as Out-in-the-Shed or just "Shed", is a biracial bisexual who lives in the fictional town of Excellent, Idaho, in the middle part of the 20th century.  In flashback, Shed reveals that in the 1880s he lived with his mother, a Shoshone Indian, and that his mother worked as a maid, laundress, and prostitute for no-nonsense but tender-hearted [[pimp|madam]] Ida Richilieu at Richilieu's hotel and brothel. The two live in a shed in the rear of Ida's place. Although Shed's mother will not speak about his father, Shed believes his father was a mentally ill cowboy named Billy Blizzard (who had been sexually involved with Shed's mother since Blizzard was 13 years old).  Blizzard goes insane, raping the teenaged Shed. Shed's mother tries to hunt down her son's rapist, but Blizzard kills her. Ida Richilieu takes Shed on, so long as Shed acts as a [[bisexuality|bisexual]] prostitute for Richilieu's customers. Shed agrees.  After a few years, Shed decides to discover more about his father and heritage.  He leaves Excellent and tries to find his mother's tribe.  On the way there, he meets Dellwood Barker, a [[Montana]] cowboy who introduces Shed to a variety of spiritual and mystical traditions. The two begin a homosexual relationship. After finding a photograph of his mother among Barker's possessions, Shed comes to believe that Barker is his father. Barker soon sends Shed on his way to the Shoshone tribe, not wishing to hinder Shed in his quest.  Shed finds his mother's tribe living on a reservation, and meets the Shoshone [[medicine man]], Owlfeather. Shed learns the true meaning of his name, but shortly thereafter is shot by Owlfeather's son, Charles Smith. Smith commits suicide moments later, and Owlfeather breathes life back into Shed (dying in the process).  After recovering, Shed sheds his Indian identity, considering it killed by Charles Smith, and he returns to Excellent.  A new and beautiful prostitute, the widow Alma Hatch, has joined the brothel, and, after Dellwood Barker appears in town, the four individuals form a tightly bonded group that share living quarters and sexual experiences.  But the town has changed as a number of [[Mormon]]s have moved to Excellent, and the town's [[libertine]] ways are going away. After some time, the four [[African American]] Wisdom brothers (Homer, Blind Jude, Ulysses, and Virgil) arrive in Excellent.  Disagreement between the Mormon settlers and Ida Richilieu and her friends breaks out and descends into arson (the brothel is burned down, killing several of their friends) and murder (the four Wisdom brothers are killed). In the period after this tragedy, Ida Richilieu, Dellwood Barker, Alma Hatch, and Shed try to break out of their depression by consuming all the opium and alcohol they can get their hands on. In a haze, Ida Richilieu and Alma Hatch attempt to go over nearby Devil's Pass in a blizzard, but their wagon overturns on a steep hill.  Alma dies, and Ida's legs are frozen up to the knees.  Dellwood Barker and Shed go after the women. They rescue Ida, but Shed and Dellwood are forced to amputate her legs to save her life. Dellwood Barker goes insane from the shock surrounding this rapid turn of events, and leaves Excellent to die. The Mormons now hold Excellent in their grasp.  Shed learns more about his heritage, but the world he knew is gone.  The book concludes with the elderly Shed reflecting on how little has changed in Excellent since the death of Alma Hatch, and how the white people of Excellent are not in touch with their true selves.  
Montana 1948
 When David's [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Maid|housekeeper]] Marie Little Soldier falls ill, Frank Hayden, the local doctor and David's uncle, is called. Marie detests the use of a doctor and insists upon seeing another doctor that she is more familiar with. Marie is further reluctant to receive medical treatment from Frank Hayden and calls for Gail, David's mother, to be in the room with her during her checkup. After she has received medical attention and is prescribed medication, Gail questions Marie and discovers that Frank has a history of abusing his medical status to [[rape|prey]] upon the local Native American women, forcing them to commit otherwise unnecessary acts. David's father, Wesley, is the local sheriff and begins to investigate these allegations against his brother, but is in a difficult situation between his loyalty to his family and his obligation to justice.  When Marie is found dead after making significant recovery before, Frank convinces the family that the cause of death was pneumonia. When David admits to seeing his uncle leave the residence hours before his babysitters death. Wesley later confronts Frank about his actions at a family dinner at their parents' house and they reach a compromise, where Wes agrees to forget the whole incident.  David, who was playing with his grandfather's pistol, once contemplates shooting Frank because of all the troubles he has given their family.  Eventually, David decides to tell his parents the truth - that he had witnessed Frank leaving their house around the same time Marie had died, implying that Frank had something to do with her death.  Wesley eventually arrests Frank, who confesses to killing Marie and molesting Indian women, and holds him captive in the basement, in order to avoid the embarrassment Frank would experience by going to the local jail.  Wesley and Frank's controlling and racist father Julian is strongly opposed to Frank's arrest and sends men to break Frank free when Wesley is not home.  Gail manages to scare them away by firing warning shots into the air, while David calls for help.  Gail later pleads for Wes to take Frank out of their home.  Wesley's moral values override his family loyalty and he agrees to take his brother to the local jail the next day, but later that night the family wakes to the sound of jars breaking in the basement.  In the morning, Wesley finds that Frank committed suicide by slitting his wrists with the broken glass.  Soon after, David's family moves out of Bentrock, ending the fight between Wesley and Julian Hayden.

Old California
 Donald Duck and his nephews [[Huey, Dewey and Louie]] are on a holiday in [[California]], heading to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. They take a small narrow road that seems deserted and discuss California's history as they travel. Donald Duck opines that the turning point in California's history was the [[California gold rush]]. As he speaks passionately on this topic, Donald Duck is momentarily distracted from his driving. The car crashes in a rock besides the road.   When Donald Duck and his three nephews regain consciousness, they find they are visitors of a local tribe of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. The tribe kindly offer to help the foursome recover. The exhausted Ducks are offered a drink, and they fall sleep. When they wake again, they find themselves in [[Alta California]], 1848. They quickly manage to befriend a local Spanish-speaking family of [[Californios]], owners of a [[cattle ranch]], together with the ranch workers. As visitors, Donald Duck and his nephews observe the family's life and moreover, they attempt to help with the family problems. They visit [[San Francisco]] and acquire land cheaply, but soon are swindled out of them by American settlers. Afterwards, the Ducks become involved in the [[Gold Rush]] and as goldminers partner with a friend from the ranch. The Ducks do the digging, and their partner's fists and guns make sure that nobody swindles them out of their gold.   After their friend departs the Ducks start to experience an odd fading of their environment. It seems to them that all their acquaintances from this era are now only distant memories. It is at this point that the Duck family truly regain consciousness to discover the truth. They were in a [[coma]] in a hospital bed for weeks. The drink they had accepted had kept them sleeping for this long. The Ducks all have the same memory of their apparent experiences in [[time travel]]. Despite this, the Ducks believe themselves fully recovered, take possession of their car (which has been completely repaired) and continue on their way as if nothing had happened. However, the Ducks do make a stop first at an abandoned old house where they had stayed as visitors in 1848. They admit that they don't know if it was all a dream or if they really experienced the events they recall from 1848, but nevertheless they choose to keep the memory of Old California.  
Noon Wine
  Royal Earle Thompson owns a dairy farm in southern Texas during the late 1890s. His farm is fairly unproductive, due in part to Thompson's laziness and distaste for most of the required labor on a dairy farm, which he considers "women's work." Thompson lives with his wife, Ellie, and two small sons, Arthur and Herbert. Ellie is continually ill, though she does her best to perform her domestic duties around the farm. The two boys, aged about six and eight when the story opens, are generally well-behaved.  One day, a man named Olaf Helton presents himself at the farm. The remarkably taciturn Swede asks Farmer Thompson for a job. Thompson agrees to employ Helton, offering him a small monthly wage, plus room and board. It is clear that Thompson views Helton as somewhat beneath him because he is a foreigner. Even though the wage is far below what Helton reports having earned in the wheat fields of North Dakota, he nonetheless sets to work immediately and proves himself to be an efficient farmhand, single-handedly transforming Thompson's run-down dairy farm into a productive, profitable enterprise.  Though he is unable to figure out anything about Helton's personal life or origins, Thompson grows to appreciate his mysterious, silent farmhand.  He increases his pay and entrusts him with much responsibility. Ellie also values Helton for the prosperity he brings to the farm. She is troubled by him just once, in a bizarre event in which she sees Helton silently shake her two boys in a terrifying manner after they had snatched his harmonica. She asks her husband to tell Helton that in the future he is to leave the discipline of the boys to their parents. The family quickly moves past the event.  Nine years go by, and the Thompson dairy farm thrives, thanks to Helton's incomparable work ethic. The Thompsons come to view Helton as one of the family; his traits of rarely speaking, never smiling, and continually playing the same song on his precious harmonica are oddities, once puzzling, that they simply accept.  One day, an offensive and irritating stranger named Homer T. Hatch shows up at the farm. Like Helton, he has come to Texas from North Dakota, and says he is there to "locate" Helton.  The man annoys Farmer Thompson immediately with his grating banter and subtle insults. Hatch eventually reveals the reason for his visit:  he is a bounty hunter, and Olaf Helton is an escaped mental patient who must be returned to the asylum.  Many years earlier, Helton killed his only brother with a pitchfork after he lost one of Helton's harmonicas and refused to replace it.  Thompson is stunned by this news and unwilling to give up Helton to Hatch, whom he instinctively feels is an evil man.  Thompson has a vision of Hatch driving a knife blade into Helton's stomach. The farmer rushes to Helton's defense, striking Hatch with an axe blade and killing him. Ellie comes on the scene only in time to see Hatch lying on the ground and Helton running away (unaccountably, in view of what Thompson "saw"), and she faints.  The fleeing Helton, in the midst of an apparent "mad" episode, such as he had never exhibited while with the Thompsons, is killed by the sheriff's men. When found, Helton's body bears no mark of a knife. It appears (though what happened is never explained) that Hatch's attack on Helton was merely Thompson's hallucination.  Thompson impresses on Ellie the importance of her swearing that she witnessed Hatch attacking Helton, and she reluctantly agrees.  After a perfunctory trial, Thompson is acquitted on the ground of self-defense/defense of another. Thompson continues to relive the killing, at one moment sure that there must have been a way to get Hatch off his farm without harming him, at the next certain that he had no choice and that if the scene were playing before his eyes again, he would instinctively act as he did before.  Worse, he is sure that though he is legally "not guilty," the community regards him as not innocent, and fears that he has become an outcast. He decides to pay a visit on every household of the small farming community, accompanied by the unwilling Ellie, in an attempt to regain his reputation. His efforts are unsuccessful; both he and Ellie can see that they have lost the esteem of their neighbors and former friends.  In a climactic scene at home, Thompson realizes that even his wife is afraid of him and that their now nearly grown sons no longer trusts him with her.  He decides that he must end his ruined life. Dressed in his best, Thompson leaves the house and walks as far as he can while still on his land.  He writes a note of explanation, saying that he never intended to harm Hatch, even though Hatch deserved to die; still, he is sorry that he had to be the one to kill him. Poignantly, Thompson puts no blame on Helton, observing that had Hatch come hunting him instead of Helton, his friend would have done the same for him.  Thompson then shoots himself with his shotgun.  
No Country for Old Men
 The plot (of the book, rather than the film) follows the interweaving paths of the three central characters (Llewelyn Moss, Anton Chigurh, and Ed Tom Bell) set in motion by events related to a drug deal gone bad near the Mexican–American border in remote [[Terrell County, Texas|Terrell County]] in southwest Texas.  In 1980, Llewelyn Moss – while hunting antelope – stumbles across the aftermath of a drug deal gone awry which has left everyone dead but a single badly wounded Mexican who pleads with Moss for water. Moss responds that he does not have any and searches the rest of the vehicles, finding a truck full of [[heroin]]. He searches for the "last man standing" and finds him dead some ways off under a tree with a satchel containing $2.4 million in cash. He takes the money and returns home. Later, however, he feels remorse for leaving the wounded man and returns to the scene with a jug of water only to find that the wounded man had since been shot and killed. When Moss looks back to his truck parked on the ridge overlooking the valley, another truck is there. After being seen, he tries to run which sparks a tense chase through a desert valley. This is the beginning of a hunt for Moss that stretches for most of the remaining novel. After escaping from his pursuers, Moss sends his wife, Carla Jean, to her mother in [[Odessa, Texas]], while he leaves his home with the money.  Sheriff Ed Tom Bell investigates the drug crime while trying to protect Moss and his young wife, with the aid of other law enforcement. Bell is haunted by his actions in [[World War II]], leaving his unit to die, for which he received a [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]]. Now in his late 50s, Bell has spent most of his life attempting to make up for the incident when he was a 21-year-old soldier. He makes it his quest to resolve the case and save Moss. Complicating things is the arrival of Anton Chigurh; a hitman hired to recover the money. Chigurh uses a [[captive bolt pistol]] (called a "stungun" in the text) to kill many of his victims (and to destroy several [[cylinder lock]]s to open doors), as well as a [[Suppressor|silenced]] shotgun. Carson Wells, a rival hitman and ex–[[Special Forces]] officer who is familiar with Chigurh, is also on the trail of the stolen money. After a brutal shootout that spills across the Mexican border and leaves both Moss and Chigurh wounded, Moss recovers at a Mexican hospital while Chigurh patches himself up in a hotel room with stolen supplies. While recuperating, Moss is approached by Wells, who offers to give him protection in exchange for the satchel and tells him his current location and phone number, instructing him to call when he has "had enough".  After recovering and leaving the hotel room, Chigurh finds Wells and murders him just as Moss calls to negotiate the exchange of money.  After answering Wells's phone, Chigurh tells Moss that he will kill Carla Jean unless he hands over the satchel.  Moss remains defiant and soon after, calls Carla Jean and tells her that he will meet up with her at a motel in [[El Paso]].  After much deliberation, Carla Jean decides to inform Sheriff Bell about the meeting and its location.  Unfortunately for her and her husband, this call is traced and provides Moss's location to some of his hunters. Later, Sheriff Bell goes to the hospital to identify Moss's body, murdered by a band of Mexicans, who were also after the drug deal cash. Later that night, Chigurh arrives at the scene and retrieves the satchel from the air duct in Moss's room. He returns it to its owner and later travels to Carla Jean's house. She pleads for her life and he offers her to flip a coin to decide her fate, but she loses and Chigurh shoots her. He leaves the house after. Soon after, he is hit by a car, which leaves him severely injured but still alive.  After bribing a pair of teenagers to remain silent about the car accident, he limps off down the road.  After a long investigation that fails to locate Chigurh, Bell decides to retire and drives away from the local courthouse feeling overmatched and defeated.  For the rest of the book, Bell describes two dreams he experienced after his father died.  In one, he met his father in town and borrowed some money from him.  In the second, Bell was riding his horse through a snow-covered pass in the mountains.  As he rode, he could see his father up ahead of him carrying a moon-colored horn lit with fire, and he knew that his father would ride on through the pass and fix a fire out in the dark and cold and that it would be waiting for him when he arrived.  
Nevada (Grey novel)
  Ben Ide, restless with the [[rancher]] life, moves his family to [[Arizona]], ostensibly for his mother's health, but also to search for his missing partner Nevada.  He buys a beautiful ranch, in a territory known for cattle rustling.  The deal soon sours as he struggles to keep his cattle and prize horses from the network of rustlers about the wild country of Arizona, not sure who he can trust and who he can't.  Hettie Ide pines away for the missing Nevada, meanwhile fending off a horde of suitors.  Nevada, having escaped the end of ''[[Forlorn River]]'' with only his life, resumes the life of an outlaw, seeking a way out of his situation, but working his way deeper amidst the labyrinthine social network of Arizona, in which everyone is a rustler and no one will say who leads the gangs.  
Riders of the Purple Sage
  The events depicted in ''Riders of the Purple Sage'' occur in mid-spring and late summer 1871. Early in ''Riders of the Purple Sage'', Jane Withersteen's main conflict is her right to befriend a Gentile. (The word [[Gentile#LDS Church usage|Gentile]] means "non-Mormon" and is used a lot in the book).<ref>Grey 1912, p. 9.</ref> Jane Withersteen’s father wished Jane to marry Elder Tull, but Jane refused saying she did not love him, causing controversy and leading to persecution by the local Mormons.   Jane's friend, [[cowboy]] Bern Venters is "arrested" by Tull and his men, but is not clear under what authority. Jane defends Venters, declaring him her best rider. Her churchmen refuse to value the opinion of a woman:  :"Tull lifted a shaking finger toward her. 'That'll do from you. Understand, you'll not be allowed to hold this boy [Venters] to a friendship that's offensive to your bishop. Jane Withersteen, your father left you wealth and power. It has turned your head. You haven't yet come to see the place of Mormon women ...'"<ref>Grey 1912, p. 14.</ref>  It is here we first hear of Lassiter; at the moment when Venters mentions Lassiter's name, the actual Lassiter is seen approaching in the distance by Tull's men.<ref>Grey 1912, pp. 14–15.</ref>  Upon his arrival, Lassiter expresses his trust in the word of women, at which Tull rebukes him, telling him not to meddle in Mormon affairs.<ref>Grey 1912, p. 18.</ref> Tull’s men begin to take Venters away, and Venters realizes who he is and screams "Lassiter!" Tull understands that this is the infamous Lassiter and flees.  Lassiter inquires as to the location of Millie Erne's grave, to which a transfixed Jane agrees to take him. Venters later tells Jane he must leave her. When she protests, Venters delivers this statement: " ... Tull is implacable. You ought to see from his intention today that ... but you can't see. Your blindness ... your damned religion! Jane, forgive me ... I'm sore within and something rankles. Well, I fear that invisible hand [of Mormon power in the region] will turn its hidden work to your ruin.", showing that Venters could see far into the future, and although Jane rebukes his statement, he is indeed correct.<ref>Grey 1912, p. 28.</ref>  Jane’s red herd is rustled shortly afterward and Venters tracks it and returns it to Jane. In the process, he wages a gun battle with two of Oldring’s rustlers, killing one and wounding Oldring’s notorious Masked Rider. When he removes the mask and shirt of the wounded rider, he discovers that she is a young woman named Bess, who was probably abused by Oldring. Venters feels very guilty about shooting a woman, and decides that it is his duty to save her.<ref>Grey 1912, pp. 63–65.</ref>  Venters discovers Surprise Valley and Balancing Rock, where he takes Bess. As she recovers, they begin to fall in love with each other, and resolve to marry. Bess also discovered the truth concerning Oldring’s team, who rustled cattle in order to disguise what they really did -- survive off gold in the streams and business deals with the Mormons.  Venters then decides that they need supplies, and makes a trip back to Cottonwoods. On his way, he sees Jane Withersteen’s prize horses being stolen. He kills the thieves and retrieves the horses, unfortunately losing his horse, Wrangle.  Jane’s horses are returned to her, and are locked in the entry hall to Withersteen's house. Venters officially breaks his friendship with Jane at this time. He goes into the village and proclaimed that he was breaking his friendship and leaving. After he leaves, Jane’s other herd gets stolen.  Jane at first pretends to love Lassiter — knowing he came to [[Utah]] to avenge his sister Milly Erne — to prevent him from murdering Mormon elders she knew were guilty. The two characters grow to love each other. Then Jane's adopted daughter Fay is kidnapped and Lassiter kills Bishop Dyer while risking his own life.  The four main characters — Venters, Bess, Lassiter, and Jane — realize that they can no longer safely stay in Utah. Lassiter convinces Jane to prepare to leave with him, Lassiter determines the name of a Mormon who contributed to the ruin of Milly and Jane implicates her father in the proselytizing of Milly. In a state of shock, Jane packs.  Meanwhile, in Surprise Valley, Venters and Bess are preparing to leave as Jane and Lassiter departing, except on burros. Lassiter sets fire to Withersteen House and flees on horseback with Jane. They encounter Venters and Bess in travel. Before they part, Lassiter explains that Bess is not really Bess Oldring, but actually Elizabeth Erne, the lost daughter of Milly Erne.  Jane gives Venters her horses, Venters and Bess gallop for Venters' Illinois home, and Lassiter and Jane find refuge in Venters' valley paradise. On the way, Lassiter rescues Fay, but they are pursued to Surprise Valley. As Tull and his men begin to climb up the cliffside, Jane shouts to Lassiter to "roll the stone," which he does. The ensuing avalanche closes the outlet to Deception Pass "forever."  (This is, of course, not true, as Jane, Lassiter, and Fay return in Grey's sequel, ''[[The Rainbow Trail]]/The Desert Crucible''.)  ===Reflections=== [[File:Title page and frontispiece Riders of the Purple Sage.jpg|thumb|Title page and frontispiece of the first edition. Caption: "Don't look back!"]]  Unlike many Western novels, which are often straightforward and stylized morality tales, ''Riders of the Purple Sage'' is a long novel with a complex plot that develops in many threads. The story is set in the ''[[canyon|cañon]]'' country of southern [[Utah]] in 1871. Jane Withersteen, a [[Mormon]]-born spinster of 28, has inherited a valuable ranch and spring from her father, which is coveted by other Mormons in the community. When Jane refuses to marry one of the ([[plural marriage|polygamous]]) Mormon elders and instead befriends Venters, a young Gentile rider, the Mormons begin to persecute her openly. Meanwhile, Lassiter, a notorious gunman, arrives at the Withersteen ranch in search of the grave of his long-lost sister, and stays on as Jane's defender while Venters is on the trail of a gang of rustlers that includes a mysterious Masked Rider. Jane is intent on preventing Lassiter from doing further violence to Mormons and is eventually driven off her ranch as the persecution escalates, but she and Lassiter fall in love, Lassiter solves the mystery of his sister's death and the fate of her child, the Masked Rider is unmasked, and Venters finds his own romance. Along the way, Jane also finds time to adopt Fay Larkin, a young Gentile orphan who accompanies her and Lassiter at the end of the story  ''Riders of the Purple Sage'' was written in 1912 and is set in a remote part of Utah after the influx of [[Mormon pioneer|Mormon settlers]] (1847-1857) as a backdrop for the plot (1871). The Mormons had been centered in [[Kirtland, Ohio]] in the 1830s and Zane Grey would have been aware of the Mormon sect given that he grew up in [[Zanesville, Ohio]].  [[Plural marriage]] was only officially prohibited by the Mormons with the issuing of the [[1890 Manifesto|First]] and [[Second Manifesto]] in 1890 and 1904 respectively, enacted primarily to allow the territory to attain statehood. In 1871, mainstream American society found plural marriage offensive. Even after the [[Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act]] was passed in 1862, the practice continued. Therefore, Zane Grey described the distaste of the institution through Lassiter in 1912, some 22 years after the practice had officially ended.

Streets of Laredo (novel)
  ===Part I: A Salaried Man=== The book opens with former Ranger Captain Woodrow F. Call (now a bounty hunter) and Ned Brookshire, the "salaried man" of the title.  Brookshire has been sent to [[Texas]] from [[New York City]] by his boss, railroad tycoon Colonel Terry, to contract Call's services in apprehending a bandit. The bandit in question is a young Mexican named Joey Garza, who has cost Terry significant business and money through his deadly train robberies. Brookshire is surprised that the old man he encounters has such a reputation, though he notes that Call does have a rather dangerous and respect-demanding aura about him. Brookshire himself does not strike a particularly imposing figure, and soon proves not to be cut out for train or horse travel, inexperienced in the ways of the west or violence, and very homesick for his bossy but loving wife, Katie. Call, on the other hand, is the very picture of experience. Though he is old and seems almost to have trouble lifting his foot into the stirrups, his reputation speaks for him. He has spent forty years on the border and the frontier, many of those with his more talkative but equally respected late partner, [[Augustus "Gus" McCrae|Gus McCrae]]. Protecting settlers in innumerable skirmishes with hostile Indians, rustlers, and dangerous gangs has earned him a great deal of respect and a reputation that generally strikes fear into the hearts of criminals.    Family is a focal point of McMurtry's book, with the emphasis on two very different families.  One is that of Pea Eye Parker, Call's corporal, a fellow former-ranger who assists Call in his bounty-hunter duties.  Pea Eye is now married to Lorena Wood, the whore heroine of ''Lonesome Dove'' and now a school teacher and mother of five.  Pea Eye is increasingly pressured by his wife and children to stop following the captain in pursuit of bandits, but his loyalty and devotion to Call usually prevails.  Though he initially refuses to accompany Call and Brookshire in the hunt for Joey Garza, his guilt wins out and he soon sets out after Call, accompanied by the celebrated Kickapoo tracker, Famous Shoes. The second family that dominates the plot of ''Streets of Laredo'' is the family of Joey Garza.  Joey's mother, Maria, is the midwife of a small Mexican village on the Rio Grande.  She has had a string of brief, failed marriages and has three children, of which Joey is the oldest.  Of the other two, her daughter, Teresa, is blind from birth, while her other, Rafael, is very slow.  One of Maria's husbands sold Joey to the [[Apache]] Indians as a slave when he was a small boy; by the time he came back to Maria and her family, he was a bitter, angry, silent boy who was obsessed with killing and stealing (unknown to Maria, Joey killed her third husband, the only one who was kind to her or her children).  Joey possesses a fine German rifle with a telescopic sight, which enables him to shoot his victims from a half-mile away.  At the outset of the novel, Joey is hiding out in Crow Town, an outlaw village deep in the borderland desert.  One of the other notorious denizens of Crow Town is the legendary Texas gunfighter, [[John Wesley Hardin]].  Maria travels by horse to Crow Town to warn Joey that Call is on his trail.  Joey disappears, stealing his mother's horse, and rides to Langtry, Texas, where he shoots and hangs Judge [[Roy Bean]], the "Law West of the Pecos".  ===Part II: The Manburner=== As Call and Brookshire search for Joey Garza, they discover that he is not the only outlaw preying on the railroad. A string of strange murders soon leads Call in the pursuit of a ghost from the past - Mox Mox (or, as the Apache call him, "The Snake You Do Not See"). A former flunky of Blue Duck, of Lonesome Dove fame, Mox Mox is known for burning his captives alive. Mox Mox was thought to have been killed years before, but had just been in hiding at sea, and has now returned at the head of a murderous gang. The news is especially traumatic for Lorie, who herself had nearly been burnt by the villain while she was a captive of Blue Duck. Fearing for the lives of her children, Lorie sends them to Nebraska, to the protection of her friend Clara Allen.  She then sets off to find Pea Eye to warn him. Pea Eye and the [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] Famous Shoes, unaware of the threat of Mox Mox, continue south to find Captain Call.  They are thrown into the Presidio jail when the sheriff accuses Famous Shoes of being a horse thief (he came across Famous Shoes eating a dead horse several years ago and decided that it was stolen) and decides to hang him.  Captain Call hears of their plight and frees them from jail (near-killing the sheriff in the process in a furious beating) and continues in pursuit of Mox Mox. He ambushes the gang just as they are about to burn two children alive, killing outright all but two  - Quick Jimmy, a renegade [[Cherokee]], who escapes unscathed, and Mox Mox himself, who limps off to die.  ===Part III: Maria's Children=== After rescuing Pea Eye and Famous Shoes from a corrupt bordertown sheriff, Call and his gang close in on Joey Garza. Ned Brookshire is killed in a scuffle; the anticipated confrontation between Call and Joey leaves Call seriously wounded; Lorie must amputate a leg to save him. The Mexican bandit is instead shot and mortally wounded by Pea Eye. Garza then drags himself back to his native village and attempts to kill his younger siblings, Teresa and Rafael, for whom he has long reserved his greatest hatred. Maria, mother of the three children, attempts to stop Joey; he stabs her.  A local villager then shoots Joey dead. Maria dies from her wounds, and at her request, Pea Eye and Lorie adopt Maria's two surviving children, returning with them to their farm. Call, crippled and no longer able to pursue bandits, goes to live with them.  He becomes increasingly attached to Teresa, Maria's blind daughter, demonstrating for the first time an attachment to anyone besides Gus McCrae, and perhaps, secretly his son Newt.

The Strange Adventures of Rangergirl
  'Rangergirl' focuses on Marzipan "Marzi" McCarty, who is an art major dropout from [[University of California, Santa Cruz|UC Santa Cruz]], who now runs the night shifts at the popular coffeeshop Genius Loci.  While she is not serving coffee to the various people of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], she works on a comic book under the same name as the title of the book.  In her comic book, Rangergirl takes on a more surreal western environment where there is a rattlesnake [[sphinx]], a scorpion [[oracle]], menacing natives, and the eternally evil Outlaw.  Recently, a college student from the east coast, named Jonathan, had rented the upstairs room located in Genius Loci because he is interested in the murals depicted within the coffee shop.  The murals were painted by Garamond Ray, who was an interesting artist but went missing the day of the 1989 [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]]; Jonathan is looking into doing his graduate thesis on the works of Garamond and these murals were his last pieces.  Lindsey, Marzi's best friend, is a regular at the coffee shop and made her goal to get Marzi and Jonathan together; Lindsey is not interested since she claims she is "done with boys."  She has her interests with Alice, a motorcycle riding lesbian.  The three become an outgoing group.  Amongst all of this, strange things begin to unravel.  An art student named Beej, who was a coffee shop regular, becomes more dirty and homeless-like, claiming he is to unleash a god.  A graduate teacher's assistant named Jane, becomes ambushed by a mudslide and is then transformed into mud being who can morph her body at her will into different shapes; she declares that her mission is to resurrect the earth goddess.   Also, Alice, Lindsey's lover, has developed her urge to set things on fire increasingly.  However, all of this connects to Genius Loci.  Both Beej and Jane make various visits to the coffee shop to unleash a god that, according to them, is held prisoner in there; Alice wants to burn the place to the ground but does not know why.  Even Marzi is subject to some strange encounters like her surreal dreams where she is floating over Santa Cruz county and sees all of it destroyed.  Plus, her own personal problems becomes apparent again when she is to confront her own fears such as opening any closed door.  Once everything is put into perspective, Marzi realizes there is some kind of presence in the Genius Loci coffee shop; an earthquake god is in the kitchen storage room, which Marzi made a distinctive point for everyone not to open.  Since Jonathan was curious about the Garamond Ray murals and he knew there was one more mural located in the storage room, he fulfilled his own curiosity and opened the door to the storage room (with the help of the power of the earthquake god).  The earthquake god pulled Jonathan into the unknown realm and the god came into the present reality.  Since Marzi became the guardian of the door, the unknown realm took on the appearance of the western world she had created in her comic, and the god became the villainous Outlaw.  Once freed, the Outlaw recruited his assistants, Beej, Jane, and Jane's supposed lover, Denis, a graduate student who is to be blamed for her mudslide incident.  The Outlaw gives Denis and Beej a project to work on: to create metal door that is reminiscent of the bat wing doors found in saloons in the Wild West.  The two do their part and create the door.  Meanwhile, Marzi and Lindsey realize that Jonathan is missing and that the Outlaw has been unleashed; they realize they need to go into the unknown realm and figure out how to save Jonathan and destroy the Outlaw.  Upon entering the storage room, the two find themselves in the western setting that Marzi had created.  When learning this, Marzi finds out that she can control the surroundings, which means manipulating the weapons they have (like Lindsey firing a gangster-style tommy gun), being knowledgeable about the enemies they encounter (like savage Native Americans who ride car-sized bugs), and many other circumstances.  They also encounter Garamond Ray, who managed to capture the Outlaw back in 1989 and put it in this realm, however, Garamond was pulled into it and was not able to get out.  While the three talk, it is revealed that the Loma Prieta earthquake was due to Garamond and the god fighting over being imprisoned.  Later, the three encounter an oracle, who explains that Marzi must go to its temple and ask one question.  After a wild adventure through the world that Mazri created, they find themselves at the oracle's temple.  Instead of asking about how to defeat the Outlaw, Marzi asks about how to save Jonathan (who was discovered by being unconscious).  The oracle answers, although disappointed because it feels that Marzi should have asked about the Outlaw, and it explains that they must enter Jonathan's soul and revive him from there.  Meanwhile, the Outlaw, Beej, Jane, and Denis have created nothing but chaos and havoc throughout Santa Cruz by firebombing parts of the downtown area and the coastal beach areas.  Once Marzi and Lindsey free Jonathan, they meet up with Garamond and all of them know their part in terms of destroying the Outlaw.  However, the door that the Outlaw demanded Denis and Beej to create was put to use.  They went to Genius Loci and placed the door on the outside of the storage room, which then fused into the mural setting (hence the saloon like door).  The door would then transport whoever walked through the door into another reality.  Marzi, Lindsey, Jonathan, and Garamond walked through the door and found themselves enveloped in Genius Loci, which was dominated by the murals coming to life.  Marzi realized that Beej is in control of the surroundings and manages to persuade him to stop the animated murals.  They then enter the present reality and confront the Outlaw.  While migrating to the Outlaw, the group encountered Jane, who had become a more monstrous mud being.  Before Jane was able to attack, suddenly Alice, Lindsey's lover, came roaring on her motorcycle and blazed Jane with an ultimate amount of fire, which disintegrated her instantly.  Marzi was stunned by this, knowing that Alice had left town in order to avoid her pyro urges.  Lindsey was an artist as well, and found a way to manipulate reality and therefore summoned the persona of Alice into the situation.  Marzi earlier was thinking of ways of destroying the Outlaw.  She realized, at first, that since all of this reality was being maintained by her comic book setting, then she and the Outlaw would have to have some kind of showdown.  Usually what happened in the stories, was that if there was no showdown, then local enforcement would imprison the outlaw, but his henchmen would be able to free him out of his cell, which is exactly what happened in this case.  While getting closer to the Outlaw, Marzi realized that if she can manipulate this reality she would be able to destroy the Outlaw willingly.  However, before she moved in on this action, it dawned on her that if she went outside from what the western reality was providing, that meant that the Outlaw would become something outside of the recent reality.   This is something the Outlaw was anticipating.  But due to the sudden realization, this altered the Outlaw's powers and Denis (who was already frustrated by the Outlaw) was able to stab him numerous in the torso and the back, killing him as if he was some kind of mortal.  Knowing that the Outlaw was destroyed, Marzi and everyone felt everything would slowly come back  to normal.  Denis did time in prison, Jane was no more, Beej was in his own world, Jonathan decided to stay in Santa Cruz, Lindsey was pleased to see the return of Alice, and Garamond became a legend to hero with his return to the world.

The stranger proves adept at roping horses, as well as facing down a gambler, Trampas, who calls him a son of a bitch. (At the time, the word was an unacceptable insult in any society, except between joking friends.) The stranger lays a pistol on the table and gently threatens, “When you call me that, smile!"  Known only as the Virginian, the stranger turns out to be the narrator's escort to Judge Henry's ranch in Sunk Creek, Wyoming. As the two travel the 263 miles to the ranch, the narrator, who is nicknamed the Tenderfoot, and the Virginian come to know one another as the Tenderfoot slowly begins to understand the nature of life in the West, which is very different from what he expected. This meeting is the beginning of a lifelong friendship and the starting point of the narrator's recounting of key episodes in the life of the Virginian.

He is followed to Warlock by his close friend Tom Morgan, a gambler and saloon owner with a sour reputation, and Kate Dollar, a former prostitute bent on vengeance. Though Blaisedell at first manages to assert his authority with his stolid demeanor and [[fast draw|expert gunmanship]], Abe McQuown and his troublesome gang of cowboys seek to antagonize him.  One of McQuown's former associates, John "Bud" Gannon, hopes to repent for the horrors of his past by becoming a deputy sheriff in Warlock, while his younger brother Billy continues to ride with McQuown. Bud's decision unsettles both the gang and the town's citizens, and he is forced to confront suspicion about his loyalties from both sides while trying to maintain his official neutrality. When Blaisedell declares several of McQuown's company banned from Warlock, the outlaws disobey the posting and ride into town. Morgan saves Blaisedell from an ambush in the ensuing shootout, and three of the outlaws, including Billy Gannon, are killed. Much of the town expects Bud to retaliate against Blaisedell out of respect for his brother, but the deputy remains impartial. Anticipating the ferocity of rumor that will inevitably surround accounts of the gunfight and wanting to avoid the distrust and resentment of the town, Blaisedell turns himself in for trial in neighboring Bright's City on the charge of murder.  Meanwhile, employees of the local silver mines go on strike, demanding better pay and a new boss. Doctor Wagner, the town physician, is the miners' staunchest advocate, but implores them to organize a union and negotiate peacefully rather than resort to mob violence and sabotage. At the same time, the Citizens' Committee tries to avert open conflict by formally requesting Warlock's incorporation as the seat of a new county, which would permit them to hire their own full-time sheriff. They are discouraged by lengthy delays and the general reluctance of officials in Bright's City to hear their pleas, including the commander of the resident army detachment, General Peach, a decorated veteran of the [[Apache Wars]] whose senility borders on complete insanity. As tensions mount and rumors swirl, the concepts of morality and justice in the legal no-man's-land become ever more ambiguous.  Blaisedell is soon acquitted of murder but resigns his position as town marshal and begins dealing [[faro (card game)|faro]] at Morgan's saloon. Kate Dollar takes an interest in Bud Gannon, seeking to use him to enact her retribution upon Blaisedell and Morgan for orchestrating the murder of her fiancé back in Texas.
